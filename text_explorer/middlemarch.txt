125: 
126: Who that cares much to know the history of man, and how the mysterious
127: mixture behaves under the varying experiments of Time, has not dwelt,
128: at least briefly, on the life of Saint Theresa, has not smiled with
129: some gentleness at the thought of the little girl walking forth one
130: morning hand-in-hand with her still smaller brother, to go and seek
131: martyrdom in the country of the Moors? Out they toddled from rugged
132: Avila, wide-eyed and helpless-looking as two fawns, but with human
133: hearts, already beating to a national idea; until domestic reality met
134: them in the shape of uncles, and turned them back from their great
135: resolve. That child-pilgrimage was a fit beginning. Theresa’s
136: passionate, ideal nature demanded an epic life: what were many-volumed
137: romances of chivalry and the social conquests of a brilliant girl to
138: her? Her flame quickly burned up that light fuel; and, fed from within,
139: soared after some illimitable satisfaction, some object which would
140: never justify weariness, which would reconcile self-despair with the
141: rapturous consciousness of life beyond self. She found her epos in the
142: reform of a religious order.
143: 
144: That Spanish woman who lived three hundred years ago, was certainly not
145: the last of her kind. Many Theresas have been born who found for
146: themselves no epic life wherein there was a constant unfolding of
147: far-resonant action; perhaps only a life of mistakes, the offspring of
148: a certain spiritual grandeur ill-matched with the meanness of
149: opportunity; perhaps a tragic failure which found no sacred poet and
150: sank unwept into oblivion. With dim lights and tangled circumstance
151: they tried to shape their thought and deed in noble agreement; but
152: after all, to common eyes their struggles seemed mere inconsistency and
153: formlessness; for these later-born Theresas were helped by no coherent
154: social faith and order which could perform the function of knowledge
155: for the ardently willing soul. Their ardor alternated between a vague
156: ideal and the common yearning of womanhood; so that the one was
157: disapproved as extravagance, and the other condemned as a lapse.
158: 
159: Some have felt that these blundering lives are due to the inconvenient
160: indefiniteness with which the Supreme Power has fashioned the natures
161: of women: if there were one level of feminine incompetence as strict as
162: the ability to count three and no more, the social lot of women might
163: be treated with scientific certitude. Meanwhile the indefiniteness
164: remains, and the limits of variation are really much wider than any one
165: would imagine from the sameness of women’s coiffure and the favorite
166: love-stories in prose and verse. Here and there a cygnet is reared
167: uneasily among the ducklings in the brown pond, and never finds the
168: living stream in fellowship with its own oary-footed kind. Here and
169: there is born a Saint Theresa, foundress of nothing, whose loving
170: heart-beats and sobs after an unattained goodness tremble off and are
171: dispersed among hindrances, instead of centring in some
172: long-recognizable deed.

188: 
189: 
190: Miss Brooke had that kind of beauty which seems to be thrown into
191: relief by poor dress. Her hand and wrist were so finely formed that she
192: could wear sleeves not less bare of style than those in which the
193: Blessed Virgin appeared to Italian painters; and her profile as well as
194: her stature and bearing seemed to gain the more dignity from her plain
195: garments, which by the side of provincial fashion gave her the
196: impressiveness of a fine quotation from the Bible,—or from one of our
197: elder poets,—in a paragraph of to-day’s newspaper. She was usually
198: spoken of as being remarkably clever, but with the addition that her
199: sister Celia had more common-sense. Nevertheless, Celia wore scarcely
200: more trimmings; and it was only to close observers that her dress
201: differed from her sister’s, and had a shade of coquetry in its
202: arrangements; for Miss Brooke’s plain dressing was due to mixed
203: conditions, in most of which her sister shared. The pride of being
204: ladies had something to do with it: the Brooke connections, though not
205: exactly aristocratic, were unquestionably “good:” if you inquired
206: backward for a generation or two, you would not find any yard-measuring
207: or parcel-tying forefathers—anything lower than an admiral or a
208: clergyman; and there was even an ancestor discernible as a Puritan
209: gentleman who served under Cromwell, but afterwards conformed, and
210: managed to come out of all political troubles as the proprietor of a
211: respectable family estate. Young women of such birth, living in a quiet
212: country-house, and attending a village church hardly larger than a
213: parlor, naturally regarded frippery as the ambition of a huckster’s
214: daughter. Then there was well-bred economy, which in those days made
215: show in dress the first item to be deducted from, when any margin was
216: required for expenses more distinctive of rank. Such reasons would have
217: been enough to account for plain dress, quite apart from religious
218: feeling; but in Miss Brooke’s case, religion alone would have
219: determined it; and Celia mildly acquiesced in all her sister’s
220: sentiments, only infusing them with that common-sense which is able to
221: accept momentous doctrines without any eccentric agitation. Dorothea
222: knew many passages of Pascal’s Pensees and of Jeremy Taylor by heart;
223: and to her the destinies of mankind, seen by the light of Christianity,
224: made the solicitudes of feminine fashion appear an occupation for
225: Bedlam. She could not reconcile the anxieties of a spiritual life
226: involving eternal consequences, with a keen interest in gimp and
227: artificial protrusions of drapery. Her mind was theoretic, and yearned
228: by its nature after some lofty conception of the world which might
229: frankly include the parish of Tipton and her own rule of conduct there;
230: she was enamoured of intensity and greatness, and rash in embracing
231: whatever seemed to her to have those aspects; likely to seek martyrdom,
232: to make retractations, and then to incur martyrdom after all in a
233: quarter where she had not sought it. Certainly such elements in the
234: character of a marriageable girl tended to interfere with her lot, and
235: hinder it from being decided according to custom, by good looks,
236: vanity, and merely canine affection. With all this, she, the elder of
237: the sisters, was not yet twenty, and they had both been educated, since
238: they were about twelve years old and had lost their parents, on plans
239: at once narrow and promiscuous, first in an English family and
240: afterwards in a Swiss family at Lausanne, their bachelor uncle and
241: guardian trying in this way to remedy the disadvantages of their
242: orphaned condition.
243: 
244: It was hardly a year since they had come to live at Tipton Grange with
245: their uncle, a man nearly sixty, of acquiescent temper, miscellaneous
246: opinions, and uncertain vote. He had travelled in his younger years,
247: and was held in this part of the county to have contracted a too
248: rambling habit of mind. Mr. Brooke’s conclusions were as difficult to
249: predict as the weather: it was only safe to say that he would act with
250: benevolent intentions, and that he would spend as little money as
251: possible in carrying them out. For the most glutinously indefinite
252: minds enclose some hard grains of habit; and a man has been seen lax
253: about all his own interests except the retention of his snuff-box,
254: concerning which he was watchful, suspicious, and greedy of clutch.
255: 
256: In Mr. Brooke the hereditary strain of Puritan energy was clearly in
257: abeyance; but in his niece Dorothea it glowed alike through faults and
258: virtues, turning sometimes into impatience of her uncle’s talk or his
259: way of “letting things be” on his estate, and making her long all the
260: more for the time when she would be of age and have some command of
261: money for generous schemes. She was regarded as an heiress; for not
262: only had the sisters seven hundred a-year each from their parents, but
263: if Dorothea married and had a son, that son would inherit Mr. Brooke’s
264: estate, presumably worth about three thousand a-year—a rental which
265: seemed wealth to provincial families, still discussing Mr. Peel’s late
266: conduct on the Catholic question, innocent of future gold-fields, and
267: of that gorgeous plutocracy which has so nobly exalted the necessities
268: of genteel life.
269: 
270: And how should Dorothea not marry?—a girl so handsome and with such
271: prospects? Nothing could hinder it but her love of extremes, and her
272: insistence on regulating life according to notions which might cause a
273: wary man to hesitate before he made her an offer, or even might lead
274: her at last to refuse all offers. A young lady of some birth and
275: fortune, who knelt suddenly down on a brick floor by the side of a sick
276: laborer and prayed fervidly as if she thought herself living in the
277: time of the Apostles—who had strange whims of fasting like a Papist,
278: and of sitting up at night to read old theological books! Such a wife
279: might awaken you some fine morning with a new scheme for the
280: application of her income which would interfere with political economy
281: and the keeping of saddle-horses: a man would naturally think twice
282: before he risked himself in such fellowship. Women were expected to
283: have weak opinions; but the great safeguard of society and of domestic
284: life was, that opinions were not acted on. Sane people did what their
285: neighbors did, so that if any lunatics were at large, one might know
286: and avoid them.
287: 
288: The rural opinion about the new young ladies, even among the cottagers,
289: was generally in favor of Celia, as being so amiable and
290: innocent-looking, while Miss Brooke’s large eyes seemed, like her
291: religion, too unusual and striking. Poor Dorothea! compared with her,
292: the innocent-looking Celia was knowing and worldly-wise; so much
293: subtler is a human mind than the outside tissues which make a sort of
294: blazonry or clock-face for it.
295: 
296: Yet those who approached Dorothea, though prejudiced against her by
297: this alarming hearsay, found that she had a charm unaccountably
298: reconcilable with it. Most men thought her bewitching when she was on
299: horseback. She loved the fresh air and the various aspects of the
300: country, and when her eyes and cheeks glowed with mingled pleasure she
301: looked very little like a devotee. Riding was an indulgence which she
302: allowed herself in spite of conscientious qualms; she felt that she
303: enjoyed it in a pagan sensuous way, and always looked forward to
304: renouncing it.
305: 
306: She was open, ardent, and not in the least self-admiring; indeed, it
307: was pretty to see how her imagination adorned her sister Celia with
308: attractions altogether superior to her own, and if any gentleman
309: appeared to come to the Grange from some other motive than that of
310: seeing Mr. Brooke, she concluded that he must be in love with Celia:
311: Sir James Chettam, for example, whom she constantly considered from
312: Celia’s point of view, inwardly debating whether it would be good for
313: Celia to accept him. That he should be regarded as a suitor to herself
314: would have seemed to her a ridiculous irrelevance. Dorothea, with all
315: her eagerness to know the truths of life, retained very childlike ideas
316: about marriage. She felt sure that she would have accepted the
317: judicious Hooker, if she had been born in time to save him from that
318: wretched mistake he made in matrimony; or John Milton when his
319: blindness had come on; or any of the other great men whose odd habits
320: it would have been glorious piety to endure; but an amiable handsome
321: baronet, who said “Exactly” to her remarks even when she expressed
322: uncertainty,—how could he affect her as a lover? The really delightful
323: marriage must be that where your husband was a sort of father, and
324: could teach you even Hebrew, if you wished it.
325: 
326: These peculiarities of Dorothea’s character caused Mr. Brooke to be all
327: the more blamed in neighboring families for not securing some
328: middle-aged lady as guide and companion to his nieces. But he himself
329: dreaded so much the sort of superior woman likely to be available for
330: such a position, that he allowed himself to be dissuaded by Dorothea’s
331: objections, and was in this case brave enough to defy the world—that is
332: to say, Mrs. Cadwallader the Rector’s wife, and the small group of
333: gentry with whom he visited in the northeast corner of Loamshire. So
334: Miss Brooke presided in her uncle’s household, and did not at all
335: dislike her new authority, with the homage that belonged to it.
336: 
337: Sir James Chettam was going to dine at the Grange to-day with another
338: gentleman whom the girls had never seen, and about whom Dorothea felt
339: some venerating expectation. This was the Reverend Edward Casaubon,
340: noted in the county as a man of profound learning, understood for many
341: years to be engaged on a great work concerning religious history; also
342: as a man of wealth enough to give lustre to his piety, and having views
343: of his own which were to be more clearly ascertained on the publication
344: of his book. His very name carried an impressiveness hardly to be
345: measured without a precise chronology of scholarship.
346: 
347: Early in the day Dorothea had returned from the infant school which she
348: had set going in the village, and was taking her usual place in the
349: pretty sitting-room which divided the bedrooms of the sisters, bent on
350: finishing a plan for some buildings (a kind of work which she delighted
351: in), when Celia, who had been watching her with a hesitating desire to
352: propose something, said—
353: 
354: “Dorothea, dear, if you don’t mind—if you are not very busy—suppose we
355: looked at mamma’s jewels to-day, and divided them? It is exactly six
356: months to-day since uncle gave them to you, and you have not looked at
357: them yet.”
358: 
359: Celia’s face had the shadow of a pouting expression in it, the full
360: presence of the pout being kept back by an habitual awe of Dorothea and
361: principle; two associated facts which might show a mysterious
362: electricity if you touched them incautiously. To her relief, Dorothea’s
363: eyes were full of laughter as she looked up.
364: 
365: “What a wonderful little almanac you are, Celia! Is it six calendar or
366: six lunar months?”
367: 
368: “It is the last day of September now, and it was the first of April
369: when uncle gave them to you. You know, he said that he had forgotten
370: them till then. I believe you have never thought of them since you
371: locked them up in the cabinet here.”
372: 
373: “Well, dear, we should never wear them, you know.” Dorothea spoke in a
374: full cordial tone, half caressing, half explanatory. She had her pencil
375: in her hand, and was making tiny side-plans on a margin.
376: 
377: Celia colored, and looked very grave. “I think, dear, we are wanting in
378: respect to mamma’s memory, to put them by and take no notice of them.
379: And,” she added, after hesitating a little, with a rising sob of
380: mortification, “necklaces are quite usual now; and Madame Poincon, who
381: was stricter in some things even than you are, used to wear ornaments.
382: And Christians generally—surely there are women in heaven now who wore
383: jewels.” Celia was conscious of some mental strength when she really
384: applied herself to argument.
385: 
386: “You would like to wear them?” exclaimed Dorothea, an air of astonished
387: discovery animating her whole person with a dramatic action which she
388: had caught from that very Madame Poincon who wore the ornaments. “Of
389: course, then, let us have them out. Why did you not tell me before? But
390: the keys, the keys!” She pressed her hands against the sides of her
391: head and seemed to despair of her memory.
392: 
393: “They are here,” said Celia, with whom this explanation had been long
394: meditated and prearranged.
395: 
396: “Pray open the large drawer of the cabinet and get out the jewel-box.”
397: 
398: The casket was soon open before them, and the various jewels spread
399: out, making a bright parterre on the table. It was no great collection,
400: but a few of the ornaments were really of remarkable beauty, the finest
401: that was obvious at first being a necklace of purple amethysts set in
402: exquisite gold work, and a pearl cross with five brilliants in it.
403: Dorothea immediately took up the necklace and fastened it round her
404: sister’s neck, where it fitted almost as closely as a bracelet; but the
405: circle suited the Henrietta-Maria style of Celia’s head and neck, and
406: she could see that it did, in the pier-glass opposite.
407: 
408: “There, Celia! you can wear that with your Indian muslin. But this
409: cross you must wear with your dark dresses.”
410: 
411: Celia was trying not to smile with pleasure. “O Dodo, you must keep the
412: cross yourself.”
413: 
414: “No, no, dear, no,” said Dorothea, putting up her hand with careless
415: deprecation.
416: 
417: “Yes, indeed you must; it would suit you—in your black dress, now,”
418: said Celia, insistingly. “You _might_ wear that.”
419: 
420: “Not for the world, not for the world. A cross is the last thing I
421: would wear as a trinket.” Dorothea shuddered slightly.
422: 
423: “Then you will think it wicked in me to wear it,” said Celia, uneasily.
424: 
425: “No, dear, no,” said Dorothea, stroking her sister’s cheek. “Souls have
426: complexions too: what will suit one will not suit another.”
427: 
428: “But you might like to keep it for mamma’s sake.”
429: 
430: “No, I have other things of mamma’s—her sandal-wood box which I am so
431: fond of—plenty of things. In fact, they are all yours, dear. We need
432: discuss them no longer. There—take away your property.”
433: 
434: Celia felt a little hurt. There was a strong assumption of superiority
435: in this Puritanic toleration, hardly less trying to the blond flesh of
436: an unenthusiastic sister than a Puritanic persecution.
437: 
438: “But how can I wear ornaments if you, who are the elder sister, will
439: never wear them?”
440: 
441: “Nay, Celia, that is too much to ask, that I should wear trinkets to
442: keep you in countenance. If I were to put on such a necklace as that, I
443: should feel as if I had been pirouetting. The world would go round with
444: me, and I should not know how to walk.”
445: 
446: Celia had unclasped the necklace and drawn it off. “It would be a
447: little tight for your neck; something to lie down and hang would suit
448: you better,” she said, with some satisfaction. The complete unfitness
449: of the necklace from all points of view for Dorothea, made Celia
450: happier in taking it. She was opening some ring-boxes, which disclosed
451: a fine emerald with diamonds, and just then the sun passing beyond a
452: cloud sent a bright gleam over the table.
453: 
454: “How very beautiful these gems are!” said Dorothea, under a new current
455: of feeling, as sudden as the gleam. “It is strange how deeply colors
456: seem to penetrate one, like scent. I suppose that is the reason why
457: gems are used as spiritual emblems in the Revelation of St. John. They
458: look like fragments of heaven. I think that emerald is more beautiful
459: than any of them.”
460: 
461: “And there is a bracelet to match it,” said Celia. “We did not notice
462: this at first.”
463: 
464: “They are lovely,” said Dorothea, slipping the ring and bracelet on her
465: finely turned finger and wrist, and holding them towards the window on
466: a level with her eyes. All the while her thought was trying to justify
467: her delight in the colors by merging them in her mystic religious joy.
468: 
469: “You _would_ like those, Dorothea,” said Celia, rather falteringly,
470: beginning to think with wonder that her sister showed some weakness,
471: and also that emeralds would suit her own complexion even better than
472: purple amethysts. “You must keep that ring and bracelet—if nothing
473: else. But see, these agates are very pretty and quiet.”
474: 
475: “Yes! I will keep these—this ring and bracelet,” said Dorothea. Then,
476: letting her hand fall on the table, she said in another tone—“Yet what
477: miserable men find such things, and work at them, and sell them!” She
478: paused again, and Celia thought that her sister was going to renounce
479: the ornaments, as in consistency she ought to do.
480: 
481: “Yes, dear, I will keep these,” said Dorothea, decidedly. “But take all
482: the rest away, and the casket.”
483: 
484: She took up her pencil without removing the jewels, and still looking
485: at them. She thought of often having them by her, to feed her eye at
486: these little fountains of pure color.
487: 
488: “Shall you wear them in company?” said Celia, who was watching her with
489: real curiosity as to what she would do.
490: 
491: Dorothea glanced quickly at her sister. Across all her imaginative
492: adornment of those whom she loved, there darted now and then a keen
493: discernment, which was not without a scorching quality. If Miss Brooke
494: ever attained perfect meekness, it would not be for lack of inward
495: fire.
496: 
497: “Perhaps,” she said, rather haughtily. “I cannot tell to what level I
498: may sink.”
499: 
500: Celia blushed, and was unhappy: she saw that she had offended her
501: sister, and dared not say even anything pretty about the gift of the
502: ornaments which she put back into the box and carried away. Dorothea
503: too was unhappy, as she went on with her plan-drawing, questioning the
504: purity of her own feeling and speech in the scene which had ended with
505: that little explosion.
506: 
507: Celia’s consciousness told her that she had not been at all in the
508: wrong: it was quite natural and justifiable that she should have asked
509: that question, and she repeated to herself that Dorothea was
510: inconsistent: either she should have taken her full share of the
511: jewels, or, after what she had said, she should have renounced them
512: altogether.
513: 
514: “I am sure—at least, I trust,” thought Celia, “that the wearing of a
515: necklace will not interfere with my prayers. And I do not see that I
516: should be bound by Dorothea’s opinions now we are going into society,
517: though of course she herself ought to be bound by them. But Dorothea is
518: not always consistent.”
519: 
520: Thus Celia, mutely bending over her tapestry, until she heard her
521: sister calling her.
522: 
523: “Here, Kitty, come and look at my plan; I shall think I am a great
524: architect, if I have not got incompatible stairs and fireplaces.”
525: 
526: As Celia bent over the paper, Dorothea put her cheek against her
527: sister’s arm caressingly. Celia understood the action. Dorothea saw
528: that she had been in the wrong, and Celia pardoned her. Since they
529: could remember, there had been a mixture of criticism and awe in the
530: attitude of Celia’s mind towards her elder sister. The younger had
531: always worn a yoke; but is there any yoked creature without its private
532: opinions?
533: 
534: 
535: 
536: 
537: CHAPTER II.
538: 
539: “‘Dime; no ves aquel caballero que hacia nosotros viene sobre un
540: caballo rucio rodado que trae puesto en la cabeza un yelmo de oro?’ ‘Lo
541: que veo y columbro,’ respondio Sancho, ‘no es sino un hombre sobre un
542: as no pardo como el mio, que trae sobre la cabeza una cosa que
543: relumbra.’ ‘Pues ese es el yelmo de Mambrino,’ dijo Don
544: Quijote.”—CERVANTES.
545: 
546: 
547: “‘Seest thou not yon cavalier who cometh toward us on a dapple-gray
548: steed, and weareth a golden helmet?’ ‘What I see,’ answered Sancho, ‘is
549: nothing but a man on a gray ass like my own, who carries something
550: shiny on his head.’ ‘Just so,’ answered Don Quixote: ‘and that
551: resplendent object is the helmet of Mambrino.’”
552: 
553: 
554: “Sir Humphry Davy?” said Mr. Brooke, over the soup, in his easy smiling
555: way, taking up Sir James Chettam’s remark that he was studying Davy’s
556: Agricultural Chemistry. “Well, now, Sir Humphry Davy; I dined with him
557: years ago at Cartwright’s, and Wordsworth was there too—the poet
558: Wordsworth, you know. Now there was something singular. I was at
559: Cambridge when Wordsworth was there, and I never met him—and I dined
560: with him twenty years afterwards at Cartwright’s. There’s an oddity in
561: things, now. But Davy was there: he was a poet too. Or, as I may say,
562: Wordsworth was poet one, and Davy was poet two. That was true in every
563: sense, you know.”
564: 
565: Dorothea felt a little more uneasy than usual. In the beginning of
566: dinner, the party being small and the room still, these motes from the
567: mass of a magistrate’s mind fell too noticeably. She wondered how a man
568: like Mr. Casaubon would support such triviality. His manners, she
569: thought, were very dignified; the set of his iron-gray hair and his
570: deep eye-sockets made him resemble the portrait of Locke. He had the
571: spare form and the pale complexion which became a student; as different
572: as possible from the blooming Englishman of the red-whiskered type
573: represented by Sir James Chettam.
574: 
575: “I am reading the Agricultural Chemistry,” said this excellent baronet,
576: “because I am going to take one of the farms into my own hands, and see
577: if something cannot be done in setting a good pattern of farming among
578: my tenants. Do you approve of that, Miss Brooke?”
579: 
580: “A great mistake, Chettam,” interposed Mr. Brooke, “going into
581: electrifying your land and that kind of thing, and making a parlor of
582: your cow-house. It won’t do. I went into science a great deal myself at
583: one time; but I saw it would not do. It leads to everything; you can
584: let nothing alone. No, no—see that your tenants don’t sell their straw,
585: and that kind of thing; and give them draining-tiles, you know. But
586: your fancy farming will not do—the most expensive sort of whistle you
587: can buy: you may as well keep a pack of hounds.”
588: 
589: “Surely,” said Dorothea, “it is better to spend money in finding out
590: how men can make the most of the land which supports them all, than in
591: keeping dogs and horses only to gallop over it. It is not a sin to make
592: yourself poor in performing experiments for the good of all.”
593: 
594: She spoke with more energy than is expected of so young a lady, but Sir
595: James had appealed to her. He was accustomed to do so, and she had
596: often thought that she could urge him to many good actions when he was
597: her brother-in-law.
598: 
599: Mr. Casaubon turned his eyes very markedly on Dorothea while she was
600: speaking, and seemed to observe her newly.
601: 
602: “Young ladies don’t understand political economy, you know,” said Mr.
603: Brooke, smiling towards Mr. Casaubon. “I remember when we were all
604: reading Adam Smith. _There_ is a book, now. I took in all the new ideas
605: at one time—human perfectibility, now. But some say, history moves in
606: circles; and that may be very well argued; I have argued it myself. The
607: fact is, human reason may carry you a little too far—over the hedge, in
608: fact. It carried me a good way at one time; but I saw it would not do.
609: I pulled up; I pulled up in time. But not too hard. I have always been
610: in favor of a little theory: we must have Thought; else we shall be
611: landed back in the dark ages. But talking of books, there is Southey’s
612: ‘Peninsular War.’ I am reading that of a morning. You know Southey?”
613: 
614: “No,” said Mr. Casaubon, not keeping pace with Mr. Brooke’s impetuous
615: reason, and thinking of the book only. “I have little leisure for such
616: literature just now. I have been using up my eyesight on old characters
617: lately; the fact is, I want a reader for my evenings; but I am
618: fastidious in voices, and I cannot endure listening to an imperfect
619: reader. It is a misfortune, in some senses: I feed too much on the
620: inward sources; I live too much with the dead. My mind is something
621: like the ghost of an ancient, wandering about the world and trying
622: mentally to construct it as it used to be, in spite of ruin and
623: confusing changes. But I find it necessary to use the utmost caution
624: about my eyesight.”
625: 
626: This was the first time that Mr. Casaubon had spoken at any length. He
627: delivered himself with precision, as if he had been called upon to make
628: a public statement; and the balanced sing-song neatness of his speech,
629: occasionally corresponded to by a movement of his head, was the more
630: conspicuous from its contrast with good Mr. Brooke’s scrappy
631: slovenliness. Dorothea said to herself that Mr. Casaubon was the most
632: interesting man she had ever seen, not excepting even Monsieur Liret,
633: the Vaudois clergyman who had given conferences on the history of the
634: Waldenses. To reconstruct a past world, doubtless with a view to the
635: highest purposes of truth—what a work to be in any way present at, to
636: assist in, though only as a lamp-holder! This elevating thought lifted
637: her above her annoyance at being twitted with her ignorance of
638: political economy, that never-explained science which was thrust as an
639: extinguisher over all her lights.
640: 
641: “But you are fond of riding, Miss Brooke,” Sir James presently took an
642: opportunity of saying. “I should have thought you would enter a little
643: into the pleasures of hunting. I wish you would let me send over a
644: chestnut horse for you to try. It has been trained for a lady. I saw
645: you on Saturday cantering over the hill on a nag not worthy of you. My
646: groom shall bring Corydon for you every day, if you will only mention
647: the time.”
648: 
649: “Thank you, you are very good. I mean to give up riding. I shall not
650: ride any more,” said Dorothea, urged to this brusque resolution by a
651: little annoyance that Sir James would be soliciting her attention when
652: she wanted to give it all to Mr. Casaubon.
653: 
654: “No, that is too hard,” said Sir James, in a tone of reproach that
655: showed strong interest. “Your sister is given to self-mortification, is
656: she not?” he continued, turning to Celia, who sat at his right hand.
657: 
658: “I think she is,” said Celia, feeling afraid lest she should say
659: something that would not please her sister, and blushing as prettily as
660: possible above her necklace. “She likes giving up.”
661: 
662: “If that were true, Celia, my giving-up would be self-indulgence, not
663: self-mortification. But there may be good reasons for choosing not to
664: do what is very agreeable,” said Dorothea.
665: 
666: Mr. Brooke was speaking at the same time, but it was evident that Mr.
667: Casaubon was observing Dorothea, and she was aware of it.
668: 
669: “Exactly,” said Sir James. “You give up from some high, generous
670: motive.”
671: 
672: “No, indeed, not exactly. I did not say that of myself,” answered
673: Dorothea, reddening. Unlike Celia, she rarely blushed, and only from
674: high delight or anger. At this moment she felt angry with the perverse
675: Sir James. Why did he not pay attention to Celia, and leave her to
676: listen to Mr. Casaubon?—if that learned man would only talk, instead of
677: allowing himself to be talked to by Mr. Brooke, who was just then
678: informing him that the Reformation either meant something or it did
679: not, that he himself was a Protestant to the core, but that Catholicism
680: was a fact; and as to refusing an acre of your ground for a Romanist
681: chapel, all men needed the bridle of religion, which, properly
682: speaking, was the dread of a Hereafter.
683: 
684: “I made a great study of theology at one time,” said Mr. Brooke, as if
685: to explain the insight just manifested. “I know something of all
686: schools. I knew Wilberforce in his best days. Do you know Wilberforce?”
687: 
688: Mr. Casaubon said, “No.”
689: 
690: “Well, Wilberforce was perhaps not enough of a thinker; but if I went
691: into Parliament, as I have been asked to do, I should sit on the
692: independent bench, as Wilberforce did, and work at philanthropy.”
693: 
694: Mr. Casaubon bowed, and observed that it was a wide field.
695: 
696: “Yes,” said Mr. Brooke, with an easy smile, “but I have documents. I
697: began a long while ago to collect documents. They want arranging, but
698: when a question has struck me, I have written to somebody and got an
699: answer. I have documents at my back. But now, how do you arrange your
700: documents?”
701: 
702: “In pigeon-holes partly,” said Mr. Casaubon, with rather a startled air
703: of effort.
704: 
705: “Ah, pigeon-holes will not do. I have tried pigeon-holes, but
706: everything gets mixed in pigeon-holes: I never know whether a paper is
707: in A or Z.”
708: 
709: “I wish you would let me sort your papers for you, uncle,” said
710: Dorothea. “I would letter them all, and then make a list of subjects
711: under each letter.”
712: 
713: Mr. Casaubon gravely smiled approval, and said to Mr. Brooke, “You have
714: an excellent secretary at hand, you perceive.”
715: 
716: “No, no,” said Mr. Brooke, shaking his head; “I cannot let young ladies
717: meddle with my documents. Young ladies are too flighty.”
718: 
719: Dorothea felt hurt. Mr. Casaubon would think that her uncle had some
720: special reason for delivering this opinion, whereas the remark lay in
721: his mind as lightly as the broken wing of an insect among all the other
722: fragments there, and a chance current had sent it alighting on _her_.
723: 
724: When the two girls were in the drawing-room alone, Celia said—
725: 
726: “How very ugly Mr. Casaubon is!”
727: 
728: “Celia! He is one of the most distinguished-looking men I ever saw. He
729: is remarkably like the portrait of Locke. He has the same deep
730: eye-sockets.”
731: 
732: “Had Locke those two white moles with hairs on them?”
733: 
734: “Oh, I dare say! when people of a certain sort looked at him,” said
735: Dorothea, walking away a little.
736: 
737: “Mr. Casaubon is so sallow.”
738: 
739: “All the better. I suppose you admire a man with the complexion of a
740: _cochon de lait_.”
741: 
742: “Dodo!” exclaimed Celia, looking after her in surprise. “I never heard
743: you make such a comparison before.”
744: 
745: “Why should I make it before the occasion came? It is a good
746: comparison: the match is perfect.”
747: 
748: Miss Brooke was clearly forgetting herself, and Celia thought so.
749: 
750: “I wonder you show temper, Dorothea.”
751: 
752: “It is so painful in you, Celia, that you will look at human beings as
753: if they were merely animals with a toilet, and never see the great soul
754: in a man’s face.”
755: 
756: “Has Mr. Casaubon a great soul?” Celia was not without a touch of naive
757: malice.
758: 
759: “Yes, I believe he has,” said Dorothea, with the full voice of
760: decision. “Everything I see in him corresponds to his pamphlet on
761: Biblical Cosmology.”
762: 
763: “He talks very little,” said Celia
764: 
765: “There is no one for him to talk to.”
766: 
767: Celia thought privately, “Dorothea quite despises Sir James Chettam; I
768: believe she would not accept him.” Celia felt that this was a pity. She
769: had never been deceived as to the object of the baronet’s interest.
770: Sometimes, indeed, she had reflected that Dodo would perhaps not make a
771: husband happy who had not her way of looking at things; and stifled in
772: the depths of her heart was the feeling that her sister was too
773: religious for family comfort. Notions and scruples were like spilt
774: needles, making one afraid of treading, or sitting down, or even
775: eating.
776: 
777: When Miss Brooke was at the tea-table, Sir James came to sit down by
778: her, not having felt her mode of answering him at all offensive. Why
779: should he? He thought it probable that Miss Brooke liked him, and
780: manners must be very marked indeed before they cease to be interpreted
781: by preconceptions either confident or distrustful. She was thoroughly
782: charming to him, but of course he theorized a little about his
783: attachment. He was made of excellent human dough, and had the rare
784: merit of knowing that his talents, even if let loose, would not set the
785: smallest stream in the county on fire: hence he liked the prospect of a
786: wife to whom he could say, “What shall we do?” about this or that; who
787: could help her husband out with reasons, and would also have the
788: property qualification for doing so. As to the excessive religiousness
789: alleged against Miss Brooke, he had a very indefinite notion of what it
790: consisted in, and thought that it would die out with marriage. In
791: short, he felt himself to be in love in the right place, and was ready
792: to endure a great deal of predominance, which, after all, a man could
793: always put down when he liked. Sir James had no idea that he should
794: ever like to put down the predominance of this handsome girl, in whose
795: cleverness he delighted. Why not? A man’s mind—what there is of it—has
796: always the advantage of being masculine,—as the smallest birch-tree is
797: of a higher kind than the most soaring palm,—and even his ignorance is
798: of a sounder quality. Sir James might not have originated this
799: estimate; but a kind Providence furnishes the limpest personality with
800: a little gum or starch in the form of tradition.
801: 
802: “Let me hope that you will rescind that resolution about the horse,
803: Miss Brooke,” said the persevering admirer. “I assure you, riding is
804: the most healthy of exercises.”
805: 
806: “I am aware of it,” said Dorothea, coldly. “I think it would do Celia
807: good—if she would take to it.”
808: 
809: “But you are such a perfect horsewoman.”
810: 
811: “Excuse me; I have had very little practice, and I should be easily
812: thrown.”
813: 
814: “Then that is a reason for more practice. Every lady ought to be a
815: perfect horsewoman, that she may accompany her husband.”
816: 
817: “You see how widely we differ, Sir James. I have made up my mind that I
818: ought not to be a perfect horsewoman, and so I should never correspond
819: to your pattern of a lady.” Dorothea looked straight before her, and
820: spoke with cold brusquerie, very much with the air of a handsome boy,
821: in amusing contrast with the solicitous amiability of her admirer.
822: 
823: “I should like to know your reasons for this cruel resolution. It is
824: not possible that you should think horsemanship wrong.”
825: 
826: “It is quite possible that I should think it wrong for me.”
827: 
828: “Oh, why?” said Sir James, in a tender tone of remonstrance.
829: 
830: Mr. Casaubon had come up to the table, teacup in hand, and was
831: listening.
832: 
833: “We must not inquire too curiously into motives,” he interposed, in his
834: measured way. “Miss Brooke knows that they are apt to become feeble in
835: the utterance: the aroma is mixed with the grosser air. We must keep
836: the germinating grain away from the light.”
837: 
838: Dorothea colored with pleasure, and looked up gratefully to the
839: speaker. Here was a man who could understand the higher inward life,
840: and with whom there could be some spiritual communion; nay, who could
841: illuminate principle with the widest knowledge: a man whose learning
842: almost amounted to a proof of whatever he believed!
843: 
844: Dorothea’s inferences may seem large; but really life could never have
845: gone on at any period but for this liberal allowance of conclusions,
846: which has facilitated marriage under the difficulties of civilization.
847: Has any one ever pinched into its pilulous smallness the cobweb of
848: pre-matrimonial acquaintanceship?
849: 
850: “Certainly,” said good Sir James. “Miss Brooke shall not be urged to
851: tell reasons she would rather be silent upon. I am sure her reasons
852: would do her honor.”
853: 
854: He was not in the least jealous of the interest with which Dorothea had
855: looked up at Mr. Casaubon: it never occurred to him that a girl to whom
856: he was meditating an offer of marriage could care for a dried bookworm
857: towards fifty, except, indeed, in a religious sort of way, as for a
858: clergyman of some distinction.
859: 
860: However, since Miss Brooke had become engaged in a conversation with
861: Mr. Casaubon about the Vaudois clergy, Sir James betook himself to
862: Celia, and talked to her about her sister; spoke of a house in town,
863: and asked whether Miss Brooke disliked London. Away from her sister,
864: Celia talked quite easily, and Sir James said to himself that the
865: second Miss Brooke was certainly very agreeable as well as pretty,
866: though not, as some people pretended, more clever and sensible than the
867: elder sister. He felt that he had chosen the one who was in all
868: respects the superior; and a man naturally likes to look forward to
869: having the best. He would be the very Mawworm of bachelors who
870: pretended not to expect it.
871: 
872: 
873: 
874: 
875: CHAPTER III.
876: 
877: “Say, goddess, what ensued, when Raphael,
878: The affable archangel . . .
879:                     Eve
880: The story heard attentive, and was filled
881: With admiration, and deep muse, to hear
882: Of things so high and strange.”
883: —_Paradise Lost_, B. vii.
884: 
885: 
886: If it had really occurred to Mr. Casaubon to think of Miss Brooke as a
887: suitable wife for him, the reasons that might induce her to accept him
888: were already planted in her mind, and by the evening of the next day
889: the reasons had budded and bloomed. For they had had a long
890: conversation in the morning, while Celia, who did not like the company
891: of Mr. Casaubon’s moles and sallowness, had escaped to the vicarage to
892: play with the curate’s ill-shod but merry children.
893: 
894: Dorothea by this time had looked deep into the ungauged reservoir of
895: Mr. Casaubon’s mind, seeing reflected there in vague labyrinthine
896: extension every quality she herself brought; had opened much of her own
897: experience to him, and had understood from him the scope of his great
898: work, also of attractively labyrinthine extent. For he had been as
899: instructive as Milton’s “affable archangel;” and with something of the
900: archangelic manner he told her how he had undertaken to show (what
901: indeed had been attempted before, but not with that thoroughness,
902: justice of comparison, and effectiveness of arrangement at which Mr.
903: Casaubon aimed) that all the mythical systems or erratic mythical
904: fragments in the world were corruptions of a tradition originally
905: revealed. Having once mastered the true position and taken a firm
906: footing there, the vast field of mythical constructions became
907: intelligible, nay, luminous with the reflected light of
908: correspondences. But to gather in this great harvest of truth was no
909: light or speedy work. His notes already made a formidable range of
910: volumes, but the crowning task would be to condense these voluminous
911: still-accumulating results and bring them, like the earlier vintage of
912: Hippocratic books, to fit a little shelf. In explaining this to
913: Dorothea, Mr. Casaubon expressed himself nearly as he would have done
914: to a fellow-student, for he had not two styles of talking at command:
915: it is true that when he used a Greek or Latin phrase he always gave the
916: English with scrupulous care, but he would probably have done this in
917: any case. A learned provincial clergyman is accustomed to think of his
918: acquaintances as of “lords, knyghtes, and other noble and worthi men,
919: that conne Latyn but lytille.”
920: 
921: Dorothea was altogether captivated by the wide embrace of this
922: conception. Here was something beyond the shallows of ladies’ school
923: literature: here was a living Bossuet, whose work would reconcile
924: complete knowledge with devoted piety; here was a modern Augustine who
925: united the glories of doctor and saint.
926: 
927: The sanctity seemed no less clearly marked than the learning, for when
928: Dorothea was impelled to open her mind on certain themes which she
929: could speak of to no one whom she had before seen at Tipton, especially
930: on the secondary importance of ecclesiastical forms and articles of
931: belief compared with that spiritual religion, that submergence of self
932: in communion with Divine perfection which seemed to her to be expressed
933: in the best Christian books of widely distant ages, she found in Mr.
934: Casaubon a listener who understood her at once, who could assure her of
935: his own agreement with that view when duly tempered with wise
936: conformity, and could mention historical examples before unknown to
937: her.
938: 
939: “He thinks with me,” said Dorothea to herself, “or rather, he thinks a
940: whole world of which my thought is but a poor twopenny mirror. And his
941: feelings too, his whole experience—what a lake compared with my little
942: pool!”
943: 
944: Miss Brooke argued from words and dispositions not less unhesitatingly
945: than other young ladies of her age. Signs are small measurable things,
946: but interpretations are illimitable, and in girls of sweet, ardent
947: nature, every sign is apt to conjure up wonder, hope, belief, vast as a
948: sky, and colored by a diffused thimbleful of matter in the shape of
949: knowledge. They are not always too grossly deceived; for Sinbad himself
950: may have fallen by good-luck on a true description, and wrong reasoning
951: sometimes lands poor mortals in right conclusions: starting a long way
952: off the true point, and proceeding by loops and zigzags, we now and
953: then arrive just where we ought to be. Because Miss Brooke was hasty in
954: her trust, it is not therefore clear that Mr. Casaubon was unworthy of
955: it.
956: 
957: He stayed a little longer than he had intended, on a slight pressure of
958: invitation from Mr. Brooke, who offered no bait except his own
959: documents on machine-breaking and rick-burning. Mr. Casaubon was called
960: into the library to look at these in a heap, while his host picked up
961: first one and then the other to read aloud from in a skipping and
962: uncertain way, passing from one unfinished passage to another with a
963: “Yes, now, but here!” and finally pushing them all aside to open the
964: journal of his youthful Continental travels.
965: 
966: “Look here—here is all about Greece. Rhamnus, the ruins of Rhamnus—you
967: are a great Grecian, now. I don’t know whether you have given much
968: study to the topography. I spent no end of time in making out these
969: things—Helicon, now. Here, now!—‘We started the next morning for
970: Parnassus, the double-peaked Parnassus.’ All this volume is about
971: Greece, you know,” Mr. Brooke wound up, rubbing his thumb transversely
972: along the edges of the leaves as he held the book forward.
973: 
974: Mr. Casaubon made a dignified though somewhat sad audience; bowed in
975: the right place, and avoided looking at anything documentary as far as
976: possible, without showing disregard or impatience; mindful that this
977: desultoriness was associated with the institutions of the country, and
978: that the man who took him on this severe mental scamper was not only an
979: amiable host, but a landholder and custos rotulorum. Was his endurance
980: aided also by the reflection that Mr. Brooke was the uncle of Dorothea?
981: 
982: Certainly he seemed more and more bent on making her talk to him, on
983: drawing her out, as Celia remarked to herself; and in looking at her
984: his face was often lit up by a smile like pale wintry sunshine. Before
985: he left the next morning, while taking a pleasant walk with Miss Brooke
986: along the gravelled terrace, he had mentioned to her that he felt the
987: disadvantage of loneliness, the need of that cheerful companionship
988: with which the presence of youth can lighten or vary the serious toils
989: of maturity. And he delivered this statement with as much careful
990: precision as if he had been a diplomatic envoy whose words would be
991: attended with results. Indeed, Mr. Casaubon was not used to expect that
992: he should have to repeat or revise his communications of a practical or
993: personal kind. The inclinations which he had deliberately stated on the
994: 2d of October he would think it enough to refer to by the mention of
995: that date; judging by the standard of his own memory, which was a
996: volume where a vide supra could serve instead of repetitions, and not
997: the ordinary long-used blotting-book which only tells of forgotten
998: writing. But in this case Mr. Casaubon’s confidence was not likely to
999: be falsified, for Dorothea heard and retained what he said with the
1000: eager interest of a fresh young nature to which every variety in
1001: experience is an epoch.
1002: 
1003: It was three o’clock in the beautiful breezy autumn day when Mr.
1004: Casaubon drove off to his Rectory at Lowick, only five miles from
1005: Tipton; and Dorothea, who had on her bonnet and shawl, hurried along
1006: the shrubbery and across the park that she might wander through the
1007: bordering wood with no other visible companionship than that of Monk,
1008: the Great St. Bernard dog, who always took care of the young ladies in
1009: their walks. There had risen before her the girl’s vision of a possible
1010: future for herself to which she looked forward with trembling hope, and
1011: she wanted to wander on in that visionary future without interruption.
1012: She walked briskly in the brisk air, the color rose in her cheeks, and
1013: her straw bonnet (which our contemporaries might look at with
1014: conjectural curiosity as at an obsolete form of basket) fell a little
1015: backward. She would perhaps be hardly characterized enough if it were
1016: omitted that she wore her brown hair flatly braided and coiled behind
1017: so as to expose the outline of her head in a daring manner at a time
1018: when public feeling required the meagreness of nature to be
1019: dissimulated by tall barricades of frizzed curls and bows, never
1020: surpassed by any great race except the Feejeean. This was a trait of
1021: Miss Brooke’s asceticism. But there was nothing of an ascetic’s
1022: expression in her bright full eyes, as she looked before her, not
1023: consciously seeing, but absorbing into the intensity of her mood, the
1024: solemn glory of the afternoon with its long swathes of light between
1025: the far-off rows of limes, whose shadows touched each other.
1026: 
1027: All people, young or old (that is, all people in those ante-reform
1028: times), would have thought her an interesting object if they had
1029: referred the glow in her eyes and cheeks to the newly awakened ordinary
1030: images of young love: the illusions of Chloe about Strephon have been
1031: sufficiently consecrated in poetry, as the pathetic loveliness of all
1032: spontaneous trust ought to be. Miss Pippin adoring young Pumpkin, and
1033: dreaming along endless vistas of unwearying companionship, was a little
1034: drama which never tired our fathers and mothers, and had been put into
1035: all costumes. Let but Pumpkin have a figure which would sustain the
1036: disadvantages of the shortwaisted swallow-tail, and everybody felt it
1037: not only natural but necessary to the perfection of womanhood, that a
1038: sweet girl should be at once convinced of his virtue, his exceptional
1039: ability, and above all, his perfect sincerity. But perhaps no persons
1040: then living—certainly none in the neighborhood of Tipton—would have had
1041: a sympathetic understanding for the dreams of a girl whose notions
1042: about marriage took their color entirely from an exalted enthusiasm
1043: about the ends of life, an enthusiasm which was lit chiefly by its own
1044: fire, and included neither the niceties of the trousseau, the pattern
1045: of plate, nor even the honors and sweet joys of the blooming matron.
1046: 
1047: It had now entered Dorothea’s mind that Mr. Casaubon might wish to make
1048: her his wife, and the idea that he would do so touched her with a sort
1049: of reverential gratitude. How good of him—nay, it would be almost as if
1050: a winged messenger had suddenly stood beside her path and held out his
1051: hand towards her! For a long while she had been oppressed by the
1052: indefiniteness which hung in her mind, like a thick summer haze, over
1053: all her desire to make her life greatly effective. What could she do,
1054: what ought she to do?—she, hardly more than a budding woman, but yet
1055: with an active conscience and a great mental need, not to be satisfied
1056: by a girlish instruction comparable to the nibblings and judgments of a
1057: discursive mouse. With some endowment of stupidity and conceit, she
1058: might have thought that a Christian young lady of fortune should find
1059: her ideal of life in village charities, patronage of the humbler
1060: clergy, the perusal of “Female Scripture Characters,” unfolding the
1061: private experience of Sara under the Old Dispensation, and Dorcas under
1062: the New, and the care of her soul over her embroidery in her own
1063: boudoir—with a background of prospective marriage to a man who, if less
1064: strict than herself, as being involved in affairs religiously
1065: inexplicable, might be prayed for and seasonably exhorted. From such
1066: contentment poor Dorothea was shut out. The intensity of her religious
1067: disposition, the coercion it exercised over her life, was but one
1068: aspect of a nature altogether ardent, theoretic, and intellectually
1069: consequent: and with such a nature struggling in the bands of a narrow
1070: teaching, hemmed in by a social life which seemed nothing but a
1071: labyrinth of petty courses, a walled-in maze of small paths that led no
1072: whither, the outcome was sure to strike others as at once exaggeration
1073: and inconsistency. The thing which seemed to her best, she wanted to
1074: justify by the completest knowledge; and not to live in a pretended
1075: admission of rules which were never acted on. Into this soul-hunger as
1076: yet all her youthful passion was poured; the union which attracted her
1077: was one that would deliver her from her girlish subjection to her own
1078: ignorance, and give her the freedom of voluntary submission to a guide
1079: who would take her along the grandest path.
1080: 
1081: “I should learn everything then,” she said to herself, still walking
1082: quickly along the bridle road through the wood. “It would be my duty to
1083: study that I might help him the better in his great works. There would
1084: be nothing trivial about our lives. Every-day things with us would mean
1085: the greatest things. It would be like marrying Pascal. I should learn
1086: to see the truth by the same light as great men have seen it by. And
1087: then I should know what to do, when I got older: I should see how it
1088: was possible to lead a grand life here—now—in England. I don’t feel
1089: sure about doing good in any way now: everything seems like going on a
1090: mission to a people whose language I don’t know;—unless it were
1091: building good cottages—there can be no doubt about that. Oh, I hope I
1092: should be able to get the people well housed in Lowick! I will draw
1093: plenty of plans while I have time.”
1094: 
1095: Dorothea checked herself suddenly with self-rebuke for the presumptuous
1096: way in which she was reckoning on uncertain events, but she was spared
1097: any inward effort to change the direction of her thoughts by the
1098: appearance of a cantering horseman round a turning of the road. The
1099: well-groomed chestnut horse and two beautiful setters could leave no
1100: doubt that the rider was Sir James Chettam. He discerned Dorothea,
1101: jumped off his horse at once, and, having delivered it to his groom,
1102: advanced towards her with something white on his arm, at which the two
1103: setters were barking in an excited manner.
1104: 
1105: “How delightful to meet you, Miss Brooke,” he said, raising his hat and
1106: showing his sleekly waving blond hair. “It has hastened the pleasure I
1107: was looking forward to.”
1108: 
1109: Miss Brooke was annoyed at the interruption. This amiable baronet,
1110: really a suitable husband for Celia, exaggerated the necessity of
1111: making himself agreeable to the elder sister. Even a prospective
1112: brother-in-law may be an oppression if he will always be presupposing
1113: too good an understanding with you, and agreeing with you even when you
1114: contradict him. The thought that he had made the mistake of paying his
1115: addresses to herself could not take shape: all her mental activity was
1116: used up in persuasions of another kind. But he was positively obtrusive
1117: at this moment, and his dimpled hands were quite disagreeable. Her
1118: roused temper made her color deeply, as she returned his greeting with
1119: some haughtiness.
1120: 
1121: Sir James interpreted the heightened color in the way most gratifying
1122: to himself, and thought he never saw Miss Brooke looking so handsome.
1123: 
1124: “I have brought a little petitioner,” he said, “or rather, I have
1125: brought him to see if he will be approved before his petition is
1126: offered.” He showed the white object under his arm, which was a tiny
1127: Maltese puppy, one of nature’s most naive toys.
1128: 
1129: “It is painful to me to see these creatures that are bred merely as
1130: pets,” said Dorothea, whose opinion was forming itself that very moment
1131: (as opinions will) under the heat of irritation.
1132: 
1133: “Oh, why?” said Sir James, as they walked forward.
1134: 
1135: “I believe all the petting that is given them does not make them happy.
1136: They are too helpless: their lives are too frail. A weasel or a mouse
1137: that gets its own living is more interesting. I like to think that the
1138: animals about us have souls something like our own, and either carry on
1139: their own little affairs or can be companions to us, like Monk here.
1140: Those creatures are parasitic.”
1141: 
1142: “I am so glad I know that you do not like them,” said good Sir James.
1143: “I should never keep them for myself, but ladies usually are fond of
1144: these Maltese dogs. Here, John, take this dog, will you?”
1145: 
1146: The objectionable puppy, whose nose and eyes were equally black and
1147: expressive, was thus got rid of, since Miss Brooke decided that it had
1148: better not have been born. But she felt it necessary to explain.
1149: 
1150: “You must not judge of Celia’s feeling from mine. I think she likes
1151: these small pets. She had a tiny terrier once, which she was very fond
1152: of. It made me unhappy, because I was afraid of treading on it. I am
1153: rather short-sighted.”
1154: 
1155: “You have your own opinion about everything, Miss Brooke, and it is
1156: always a good opinion.”
1157: 
1158: What answer was possible to such stupid complimenting?
1159: 
1160: “Do you know, I envy you that,” Sir James said, as they continued
1161: walking at the rather brisk pace set by Dorothea.
1162: 
1163: “I don’t quite understand what you mean.”
1164: 
1165: “Your power of forming an opinion. I can form an opinion of persons. I
1166: know when I like people. But about other matters, do you know, I have
1167: often a difficulty in deciding. One hears very sensible things said on
1168: opposite sides.”
1169: 
1170: “Or that seem sensible. Perhaps we don’t always discriminate between
1171: sense and nonsense.”
1172: 
1173: Dorothea felt that she was rather rude.
1174: 
1175: “Exactly,” said Sir James. “But you seem to have the power of
1176: discrimination.”
1177: 
1178: “On the contrary, I am often unable to decide. But that is from
1179: ignorance. The right conclusion is there all the same, though I am
1180: unable to see it.”
1181: 
1182: “I think there are few who would see it more readily. Do you know,
1183: Lovegood was telling me yesterday that you had the best notion in the
1184: world of a plan for cottages—quite wonderful for a young lady, he
1185: thought. You had a real _genus_, to use his expression. He said you
1186: wanted Mr. Brooke to build a new set of cottages, but he seemed to
1187: think it hardly probable that your uncle would consent. Do you know,
1188: that is one of the things I wish to do—I mean, on my own estate. I
1189: should be so glad to carry out that plan of yours, if you would let me
1190: see it. Of course, it is sinking money; that is why people object to
1191: it. Laborers can never pay rent to make it answer. But, after all, it
1192: is worth doing.”
1193: 
1194: “Worth doing! yes, indeed,” said Dorothea, energetically, forgetting
1195: her previous small vexations. “I think we deserve to be beaten out of
1196: our beautiful houses with a scourge of small cords—all of us who let
1197: tenants live in such sties as we see round us. Life in cottages might
1198: be happier than ours, if they were real houses fit for human beings
1199: from whom we expect duties and affections.”
1200: 
1201: “Will you show me your plan?”
1202: 
1203: “Yes, certainly. I dare say it is very faulty. But I have been
1204: examining all the plans for cottages in Loudon’s book, and picked out
1205: what seem the best things. Oh what a happiness it would be to set the
1206: pattern about here! I think instead of Lazarus at the gate, we should
1207: put the pigsty cottages outside the park-gate.”
1208: 
1209: Dorothea was in the best temper now. Sir James, as brother in-law,
1210: building model cottages on his estate, and then, perhaps, others being
1211: built at Lowick, and more and more elsewhere in imitation—it would be
1212: as if the spirit of Oberlin had passed over the parishes to make the
1213: life of poverty beautiful!
1214: 
1215: Sir James saw all the plans, and took one away to consult upon with
1216: Lovegood. He also took away a complacent sense that he was making great
1217: progress in Miss Brooke’s good opinion. The Maltese puppy was not
1218: offered to Celia; an omission which Dorothea afterwards thought of with
1219: surprise; but she blamed herself for it. She had been engrossing Sir
1220: James. After all, it was a relief that there was no puppy to tread
1221: upon.
1222: 
1223: Celia was present while the plans were being examined, and observed Sir
1224: James’s illusion. “He thinks that Dodo cares about him, and she only
1225: cares about her plans. Yet I am not certain that she would refuse him
1226: if she thought he would let her manage everything and carry out all her
1227: notions. And how very uncomfortable Sir James would be! I cannot bear
1228: notions.”
1229: 
1230: It was Celia’s private luxury to indulge in this dislike. She dared not
1231: confess it to her sister in any direct statement, for that would be
1232: laying herself open to a demonstration that she was somehow or other at
1233: war with all goodness. But on safe opportunities, she had an indirect
1234: mode of making her negative wisdom tell upon Dorothea, and calling her
1235: down from her rhapsodic mood by reminding her that people were staring,
1236: not listening. Celia was not impulsive: what she had to say could wait,
1237: and came from her always with the same quiet staccato evenness. When
1238: people talked with energy and emphasis she watched their faces and
1239: features merely. She never could understand how well-bred persons
1240: consented to sing and open their mouths in the ridiculous manner
1241: requisite for that vocal exercise.
1242: 
1243: It was not many days before Mr. Casaubon paid a morning visit, on which
1244: he was invited again for the following week to dine and stay the night.
1245: Thus Dorothea had three more conversations with him, and was convinced
1246: that her first impressions had been just. He was all she had at first
1247: imagined him to be: almost everything he had said seemed like a
1248: specimen from a mine, or the inscription on the door of a museum which
1249: might open on the treasures of past ages; and this trust in his mental
1250: wealth was all the deeper and more effective on her inclination because
1251: it was now obvious that his visits were made for her sake. This
1252: accomplished man condescended to think of a young girl, and take the
1253: pains to talk to her, not with absurd compliment, but with an appeal to
1254: her understanding, and sometimes with instructive correction. What
1255: delightful companionship! Mr. Casaubon seemed even unconscious that
1256: trivialities existed, and never handed round that small-talk of heavy
1257: men which is as acceptable as stale bride-cake brought forth with an
1258: odor of cupboard. He talked of what he was interested in, or else he
1259: was silent and bowed with sad civility. To Dorothea this was adorable
1260: genuineness, and religious abstinence from that artificiality which
1261: uses up the soul in the efforts of pretence. For she looked as
1262: reverently at Mr. Casaubon’s religious elevation above herself as she
1263: did at his intellect and learning. He assented to her expressions of
1264: devout feeling, and usually with an appropriate quotation; he allowed
1265: himself to say that he had gone through some spiritual conflicts in his
1266: youth; in short, Dorothea saw that here she might reckon on
1267: understanding, sympathy, and guidance. On one—only one—of her favorite
1268: themes she was disappointed. Mr. Casaubon apparently did not care about
1269: building cottages, and diverted the talk to the extremely narrow
1270: accommodation which was to be had in the dwellings of the ancient
1271: Egyptians, as if to check a too high standard. After he was gone,
1272: Dorothea dwelt with some agitation on this indifference of his; and her
1273: mind was much exercised with arguments drawn from the varying
1274: conditions of climate which modify human needs, and from the admitted
1275: wickedness of pagan despots. Should she not urge these arguments on Mr.
1276: Casaubon when he came again? But further reflection told her that she
1277: was presumptuous in demanding his attention to such a subject; he would
1278: not disapprove of her occupying herself with it in leisure moments, as
1279: other women expected to occupy themselves with their dress and
1280: embroidery—would not forbid it when—Dorothea felt rather ashamed as she
1281: detected herself in these speculations. But her uncle had been invited
1282: to go to Lowick to stay a couple of days: was it reasonable to suppose
1283: that Mr. Casaubon delighted in Mr. Brooke’s society for its own sake,
1284: either with or without documents?
1285: 
1286: Meanwhile that little disappointment made her delight the more in Sir
1287: James Chettam’s readiness to set on foot the desired improvements. He
1288: came much oftener than Mr. Casaubon, and Dorothea ceased to find him
1289: disagreeable since he showed himself so entirely in earnest; for he had
1290: already entered with much practical ability into Lovegood’s estimates,
1291: and was charmingly docile. She proposed to build a couple of cottages,
1292: and transfer two families from their old cabins, which could then be
1293: pulled down, so that new ones could be built on the old sites. Sir
1294: James said “Exactly,” and she bore the word remarkably well.
1295: 
1296: Certainly these men who had so few spontaneous ideas might be very
1297: useful members of society under good feminine direction, if they were
1298: fortunate in choosing their sisters-in-law! It is difficult to say
1299: whether there was or was not a little wilfulness in her continuing
1300: blind to the possibility that another sort of choice was in question in
1301: relation to her. But her life was just now full of hope and action: she
1302: was not only thinking of her plans, but getting down learned books from
1303: the library and reading many things hastily (that she might be a little
1304: less ignorant in talking to Mr. Casaubon), all the while being visited
1305: with conscientious questionings whether she were not exalting these
1306: poor doings above measure and contemplating them with that
1307: self-satisfaction which was the last doom of ignorance and folly.
1308: 
1309: 
1310: 
1311: 
1312: CHAPTER IV.
1313: 
1314: 1_st Gent_. Our deeds are fetters that we forge ourselves.
1315: 
1316: 2_d Gent._ Ay, truly: but I think it is the world
1317: That brings the iron.
1318: 
1319: 
1320: “Sir James seems determined to do everything you wish,” said Celia, as
1321: they were driving home from an inspection of the new building-site.
1322: 
1323: “He is a good creature, and more sensible than any one would imagine,”
1324: said Dorothea, inconsiderately.
1325: 
1326: “You mean that he appears silly.”
1327: 
1328: “No, no,” said Dorothea, recollecting herself, and laying her hand on
1329: her sister’s a moment, “but he does not talk equally well on all
1330: subjects.”
1331: 
1332: “I should think none but disagreeable people do,” said Celia, in her
1333: usual purring way. “They must be very dreadful to live with. Only
1334: think! at breakfast, and always.”
1335: 
1336: Dorothea laughed. “O Kitty, you are a wonderful creature!” She pinched
1337: Celia’s chin, being in the mood now to think her very winning and
1338: lovely—fit hereafter to be an eternal cherub, and if it were not
1339: doctrinally wrong to say so, hardly more in need of salvation than a
1340: squirrel. “Of course people need not be always talking well. Only one
1341: tells the quality of their minds when they try to talk well.”
1342: 
1343: “You mean that Sir James tries and fails.”
1344: 
1345: “I was speaking generally. Why do you catechise me about Sir James? It
1346: is not the object of his life to please me.”
1347: 
1348: “Now, Dodo, can you really believe that?”
1349: 
1350: “Certainly. He thinks of me as a future sister—that is all.” Dorothea
1351: had never hinted this before, waiting, from a certain shyness on such
1352: subjects which was mutual between the sisters, until it should be
1353: introduced by some decisive event. Celia blushed, but said at once—
1354: 
1355: “Pray do not make that mistake any longer, Dodo. When Tantripp was
1356: brushing my hair the other day, she said that Sir James’s man knew from
1357: Mrs. Cadwallader’s maid that Sir James was to marry the eldest Miss
1358: Brooke.”
1359: 
1360: “How can you let Tantripp talk such gossip to you, Celia?” said
1361: Dorothea, indignantly, not the less angry because details asleep in her
1362: memory were now awakened to confirm the unwelcome revelation. “You must
1363: have asked her questions. It is degrading.”
1364: 
1365: “I see no harm at all in Tantripp’s talking to me. It is better to hear
1366: what people say. You see what mistakes you make by taking up notions. I
1367: am quite sure that Sir James means to make you an offer; and he
1368: believes that you will accept him, especially since you have been so
1369: pleased with him about the plans. And uncle too—I know he expects it.
1370: Every one can see that Sir James is very much in love with you.”
1371: 
1372: The revulsion was so strong and painful in Dorothea’s mind that the
1373: tears welled up and flowed abundantly. All her dear plans were
1374: embittered, and she thought with disgust of Sir James’s conceiving that
1375: she recognized him as her lover. There was vexation too on account of
1376: Celia.
1377: 
1378: “How could he expect it?” she burst forth in her most impetuous manner.
1379: “I have never agreed with him about anything but the cottages: I was
1380: barely polite to him before.”
1381: 
1382: “But you have been so pleased with him since then; he has begun to feel
1383: quite sure that you are fond of him.”
1384: 
1385: “Fond of him, Celia! How can you choose such odious expressions?” said
1386: Dorothea, passionately.
1387: 
1388: “Dear me, Dorothea, I suppose it would be right for you to be fond of a
1389: man whom you accepted for a husband.”
1390: 
1391: “It is offensive to me to say that Sir James could think I was fond of
1392: him. Besides, it is not the right word for the feeling I must have
1393: towards the man I would accept as a husband.”
1394: 
1395: “Well, I am sorry for Sir James. I thought it right to tell you,
1396: because you went on as you always do, never looking just where you are,
1397: and treading in the wrong place. You always see what nobody else sees;
1398: it is impossible to satisfy you; yet you never see what is quite plain.
1399: That’s your way, Dodo.” Something certainly gave Celia unusual courage;
1400: and she was not sparing the sister of whom she was occasionally in awe.
1401: Who can tell what just criticisms Murr the Cat may be passing on us
1402: beings of wider speculation?
1403: 
1404: “It is very painful,” said Dorothea, feeling scourged. “I can have no
1405: more to do with the cottages. I must be uncivil to him. I must tell him
1406: I will have nothing to do with them. It is very painful.” Her eyes
1407: filled again with tears.
1408: 
1409: “Wait a little. Think about it. You know he is going away for a day or
1410: two to see his sister. There will be nobody besides Lovegood.” Celia
1411: could not help relenting. “Poor Dodo,” she went on, in an amiable
1412: staccato. “It is very hard: it is your favorite _fad_ to draw plans.”
1413: 
1414: “_Fad_ to draw plans! Do you think I only care about my
1415: fellow-creatures’ houses in that childish way? I may well make
1416: mistakes. How can one ever do anything nobly Christian, living among
1417: people with such petty thoughts?”
1418: 
1419: No more was said; Dorothea was too much jarred to recover her temper
1420: and behave so as to show that she admitted any error in herself. She
1421: was disposed rather to accuse the intolerable narrowness and the
1422: purblind conscience of the society around her: and Celia was no longer
1423: the eternal cherub, but a thorn in her spirit, a pink-and-white
1424: nullifidian, worse than any discouraging presence in the “Pilgrim’s
1425: Progress.” The _fad_ of drawing plans! What was life worth—what great
1426: faith was possible when the whole effect of one’s actions could be
1427: withered up into such parched rubbish as that? When she got out of the
1428: carriage, her cheeks were pale and her eyelids red. She was an image of
1429: sorrow, and her uncle who met her in the hall would have been alarmed,
1430: if Celia had not been close to her looking so pretty and composed, that
1431: he at once concluded Dorothea’s tears to have their origin in her
1432: excessive religiousness. He had returned, during their absence, from a
1433: journey to the county town, about a petition for the pardon of some
1434: criminal.
1435: 
1436: “Well, my dears,” he said, kindly, as they went up to kiss him, “I hope
1437: nothing disagreeable has happened while I have been away.”
1438: 
1439: “No, uncle,” said Celia, “we have been to Freshitt to look at the
1440: cottages. We thought you would have been at home to lunch.”
1441: 
1442: “I came by Lowick to lunch—you didn’t know I came by Lowick. And I have
1443: brought a couple of pamphlets for you, Dorothea—in the library, you
1444: know; they lie on the table in the library.”
1445: 
1446: It seemed as if an electric stream went through Dorothea, thrilling her
1447: from despair into expectation. They were pamphlets about the early
1448: Church. The oppression of Celia, Tantripp, and Sir James was shaken
1449: off, and she walked straight to the library. Celia went up-stairs. Mr.
1450: Brooke was detained by a message, but when he re-entered the library,
1451: he found Dorothea seated and already deep in one of the pamphlets which
1452: had some marginal manuscript of Mr. Casaubon’s,—taking it in as eagerly
1453: as she might have taken in the scent of a fresh bouquet after a dry,
1454: hot, dreary walk.
1455: 
1456: She was getting away from Tipton and Freshitt, and her own sad
1457: liability to tread in the wrong places on her way to the New Jerusalem.
1458: 
1459: Mr. Brooke sat down in his arm-chair, stretched his legs towards the
1460: wood-fire, which had fallen into a wondrous mass of glowing dice
1461: between the dogs, and rubbed his hands gently, looking very mildly
1462: towards Dorothea, but with a neutral leisurely air, as if he had
1463: nothing particular to say. Dorothea closed her pamphlet, as soon as she
1464: was aware of her uncle’s presence, and rose as if to go. Usually she
1465: would have been interested about her uncle’s merciful errand on behalf
1466: of the criminal, but her late agitation had made her absent-minded.
1467: 
1468: “I came back by Lowick, you know,” said Mr. Brooke, not as if with any
1469: intention to arrest her departure, but apparently from his usual
1470: tendency to say what he had said before. This fundamental principle of
1471: human speech was markedly exhibited in Mr. Brooke. “I lunched there and
1472: saw Casaubon’s library, and that kind of thing. There’s a sharp air,
1473: driving. Won’t you sit down, my dear? You look cold.”
1474: 
1475: Dorothea felt quite inclined to accept the invitation. Some times, when
1476: her uncle’s easy way of taking things did not happen to be
1477: exasperating, it was rather soothing. She threw off her mantle and
1478: bonnet, and sat down opposite to him, enjoying the glow, but lifting up
1479: her beautiful hands for a screen. They were not thin hands, or small
1480: hands; but powerful, feminine, maternal hands. She seemed to be holding
1481: them up in propitiation for her passionate desire to know and to think,
1482: which in the unfriendly mediums of Tipton and Freshitt had issued in
1483: crying and red eyelids.
1484: 
1485: She bethought herself now of the condemned criminal. “What news have
1486: you brought about the sheep-stealer, uncle?”
1487: 
1488: “What, poor Bunch?—well, it seems we can’t get him off—he is to be
1489: hanged.”
1490: 
1491: Dorothea’s brow took an expression of reprobation and pity.
1492: 
1493: “Hanged, you know,” said Mr. Brooke, with a quiet nod. “Poor Romilly!
1494: he would have helped us. I knew Romilly. Casaubon didn’t know Romilly.
1495: He is a little buried in books, you know, Casaubon is.”
1496: 
1497: “When a man has great studies and is writing a great work, he must of
1498: course give up seeing much of the world. How can he go about making
1499: acquaintances?”
1500: 
1501: “That’s true. But a man mopes, you know. I have always been a bachelor
1502: too, but I have that sort of disposition that I never moped; it was my
1503: way to go about everywhere and take in everything. I never moped: but I
1504: can see that Casaubon does, you know. He wants a companion—a companion,
1505: you know.”
1506: 
1507: “It would be a great honor to any one to be his companion,” said
1508: Dorothea, energetically.
1509: 
1510: “You like him, eh?” said Mr. Brooke, without showing any surprise, or
1511: other emotion. “Well, now, I’ve known Casaubon ten years, ever since he
1512: came to Lowick. But I never got anything out of him—any ideas, you
1513: know. However, he is a tiptop man and may be a bishop—that kind of
1514: thing, you know, if Peel stays in. And he has a very high opinion of
1515: you, my dear.”
1516: 
1517: Dorothea could not speak.
1518: 
1519: “The fact is, he has a very high opinion indeed of you. And he speaks
1520: uncommonly well—does Casaubon. He has deferred to me, you not being of
1521: age. In short, I have promised to speak to you, though I told him I
1522: thought there was not much chance. I was bound to tell him that. I
1523: said, my niece is very young, and that kind of thing. But I didn’t
1524: think it necessary to go into everything. However, the long and the
1525: short of it is, that he has asked my permission to make you an offer of
1526: marriage—of marriage, you know,” said Mr. Brooke, with his explanatory
1527: nod. “I thought it better to tell you, my dear.”
1528: 
1529: No one could have detected any anxiety in Mr. Brooke’s manner, but he
1530: did really wish to know something of his niece’s mind, that, if there
1531: were any need for advice, he might give it in time. What feeling he, as
1532: a magistrate who had taken in so many ideas, could make room for, was
1533: unmixedly kind. Since Dorothea did not speak immediately, he repeated,
1534: “I thought it better to tell you, my dear.”
1535: 
1536: “Thank you, uncle,” said Dorothea, in a clear unwavering tone. “I am
1537: very grateful to Mr. Casaubon. If he makes me an offer, I shall accept
1538: him. I admire and honor him more than any man I ever saw.”
1539: 
1540: Mr. Brooke paused a little, and then said in a lingering low tone, “Ah?
1541: … Well! He is a good match in some respects. But now, Chettam is a good
1542: match. And our land lies together. I shall never interfere against your
1543: wishes, my dear. People should have their own way in marriage, and that
1544: sort of thing—up to a certain point, you know. I have always said that,
1545: up to a certain point. I wish you to marry well; and I have good reason
1546: to believe that Chettam wishes to marry you. I mention it, you know.”
1547: 
1548: “It is impossible that I should ever marry Sir James Chettam,” said
1549: Dorothea. “If he thinks of marrying me, he has made a great mistake.”
1550: 
1551: “That is it, you see. One never knows. I should have thought Chettam
1552: was just the sort of man a woman would like, now.”
1553: 
1554: “Pray do not mention him in that light again, uncle,” said Dorothea,
1555: feeling some of her late irritation revive.
1556: 
1557: Mr. Brooke wondered, and felt that women were an inexhaustible subject
1558: of study, since even he at his age was not in a perfect state of
1559: scientific prediction about them. Here was a fellow like Chettam with
1560: no chance at all.
1561: 
1562: “Well, but Casaubon, now. There is no hurry—I mean for you. It’s true,
1563: every year will tell upon him. He is over five-and-forty, you know. I
1564: should say a good seven-and-twenty years older than you. To be sure,—if
1565: you like learning and standing, and that sort of thing, we can’t have
1566: everything. And his income is good—he has a handsome property
1567: independent of the Church—his income is good. Still he is not young,
1568: and I must not conceal from you, my dear, that I think his health is
1569: not over-strong. I know nothing else against him.”
1570: 
1571: “I should not wish to have a husband very near my own age,” said
1572: Dorothea, with grave decision. “I should wish to have a husband who was
1573: above me in judgment and in all knowledge.”
1574: 
1575: Mr. Brooke repeated his subdued, “Ah?—I thought you had more of your
1576: own opinion than most girls. I thought you liked your own opinion—liked
1577: it, you know.”
1578: 
1579: “I cannot imagine myself living without some opinions, but I should
1580: wish to have good reasons for them, and a wise man could help me to see
1581: which opinions had the best foundation, and would help me to live
1582: according to them.”
1583: 
1584: “Very true. You couldn’t put the thing better—couldn’t put it better,
1585: beforehand, you know. But there are oddities in things,” continued Mr.
1586: Brooke, whose conscience was really roused to do the best he could for
1587: his niece on this occasion. “Life isn’t cast in a mould—not cut out by
1588: rule and line, and that sort of thing. I never married myself, and it
1589: will be the better for you and yours. The fact is, I never loved any
1590: one well enough to put myself into a noose for them. It _is_ a noose,
1591: you know. Temper, now. There is temper. And a husband likes to be
1592: master.”
1593: 
1594: “I know that I must expect trials, uncle. Marriage is a state of higher
1595: duties. I never thought of it as mere personal ease,” said poor
1596: Dorothea.
1597: 
1598: “Well, you are not fond of show, a great establishment, balls, dinners,
1599: that kind of thing. I can see that Casaubon’s ways might suit you
1600: better than Chettam’s. And you shall do as you like, my dear. I would
1601: not hinder Casaubon; I said so at once; for there is no knowing how
1602: anything may turn out. You have not the same tastes as every young
1603: lady; and a clergyman and scholar—who may be a bishop—that kind of
1604: thing—may suit you better than Chettam. Chettam is a good fellow, a
1605: good sound-hearted fellow, you know; but he doesn’t go much into ideas.
1606: I did, when I was his age. But Casaubon’s eyes, now. I think he has
1607: hurt them a little with too much reading.”
1608: 
1609: “I should be all the happier, uncle, the more room there was for me to
1610: help him,” said Dorothea, ardently.
1611: 
1612: “You have quite made up your mind, I see. Well, my dear, the fact is, I
1613: have a letter for you in my pocket.” Mr. Brooke handed the letter to
1614: Dorothea, but as she rose to go away, he added, “There is not too much
1615: hurry, my dear. Think about it, you know.”
1616: 
1617: When Dorothea had left him, he reflected that he had certainly spoken
1618: strongly: he had put the risks of marriage before her in a striking
1619: manner. It was his duty to do so. But as to pretending to be wise for
1620: young people,—no uncle, however much he had travelled in his youth,
1621: absorbed the new ideas, and dined with celebrities now deceased, could
1622: pretend to judge what sort of marriage would turn out well for a young
1623: girl who preferred Casaubon to Chettam. In short, woman was a problem
1624: which, since Mr. Brooke’s mind felt blank before it, could be hardly
1625: less complicated than the revolutions of an irregular solid.

1630: CHAPTER V.
1631: 
1632: “Hard students are commonly troubled with gowts, catarrhs, rheums,
1633: cachexia, bradypepsia, bad eyes, stone, and collick, crudities,
1634: oppilations, vertigo, winds, consumptions, and all such diseases as
1635: come by over-much sitting: they are most part lean, dry, ill-colored …
1636: and all through immoderate pains and extraordinary studies. If you will
1637: not believe the truth of this, look upon great Tostatus and Thomas
1638: Aquainas’ works; and tell me whether those men took pains.”—BURTON’S
1639: _Anatomy of Melancholy_, P. I, s. 2.
1640: 
1641: 
1642: This was Mr. Casaubon’s letter.
1643: 
1644: MY DEAR MISS BROOKE,—I have your guardian’s permission to address you
1645: on a subject than which I have none more at heart. I am not, I trust,
1646: mistaken in the recognition of some deeper correspondence than that of
1647: date in the fact that a consciousness of need in my own life had arisen
1648: contemporaneously with the possibility of my becoming acquainted with
1649: you. For in the first hour of meeting you, I had an impression of your
1650: eminent and perhaps exclusive fitness to supply that need (connected, I
1651: may say, with such activity of the affections as even the
1652: preoccupations of a work too special to be abdicated could not
1653: uninterruptedly dissimulate); and each succeeding opportunity for
1654: observation has given the impression an added depth by convincing me
1655: more emphatically of that fitness which I had preconceived, and thus
1656: evoking more decisively those affections to which I have but now
1657: referred. Our conversations have, I think, made sufficiently clear to
1658: you the tenor of my life and purposes: a tenor unsuited, I am aware, to
1659: the commoner order of minds. But I have discerned in you an elevation
1660: of thought and a capability of devotedness, which I had hitherto not
1661: conceived to be compatible either with the early bloom of youth or with
1662: those graces of sex that may be said at once to win and to confer
1663: distinction when combined, as they notably are in you, with the mental
1664: qualities above indicated. It was, I confess, beyond my hope to meet
1665: with this rare combination of elements both solid and attractive,
1666: adapted to supply aid in graver labors and to cast a charm over vacant
1667: hours; and but for the event of my introduction to you (which, let me
1668: again say, I trust not to be superficially coincident with
1669: foreshadowing needs, but providentially related thereto as stages
1670: towards the completion of a life’s plan), I should presumably have gone
1671: on to the last without any attempt to lighten my solitariness by a
1672: matrimonial union.
1673:     Such, my dear Miss Brooke, is the accurate statement of my
1674:     feelings; and I rely on your kind indulgence in venturing now to
1675:     ask you how far your own are of a nature to confirm my happy
1676:     presentiment. To be accepted by you as your husband and the earthly
1677:     guardian of your welfare, I should regard as the highest of
1678:     providential gifts. In return I can at least offer you an affection
1679:     hitherto unwasted, and the faithful consecration of a life which,
1680:     however short in the sequel, has no backward pages whereon, if you
1681:     choose to turn them, you will find records such as might justly
1682:     cause you either bitterness or shame. I await the expression of
1683:     your sentiments with an anxiety which it would be the part of
1684:     wisdom (were it possible) to divert by a more arduous labor than
1685:     usual. But in this order of experience I am still young, and in
1686:     looking forward to an unfavorable possibility I cannot but feel
1687:     that resignation to solitude will be more difficult after the
1688:     temporary illumination of hope.
1689: 
1690: 
1691: In any case, I shall remain,
1692:     Yours with sincere devotion,
1693:         EDWARD CASAUBON.
1694: 
1695: 
1696: Dorothea trembled while she read this letter; then she fell on her
1697: knees, buried her face, and sobbed. She could not pray: under the rush
1698: of solemn emotion in which thoughts became vague and images floated
1699: uncertainly, she could but cast herself, with a childlike sense of
1700: reclining, in the lap of a divine consciousness which sustained her
1701: own. She remained in that attitude till it was time to dress for
1702: dinner.
1703: 
1704: How could it occur to her to examine the letter, to look at it
1705: critically as a profession of love? Her whole soul was possessed by the
1706: fact that a fuller life was opening before her: she was a neophyte
1707: about to enter on a higher grade of initiation. She was going to have
1708: room for the energies which stirred uneasily under the dimness and
1709: pressure of her own ignorance and the petty peremptoriness of the
1710: world’s habits.
1711: 
1712: Now she would be able to devote herself to large yet definite duties;
1713: now she would be allowed to live continually in the light of a mind
1714: that she could reverence. This hope was not unmixed with the glow of
1715: proud delight—the joyous maiden surprise that she was chosen by the man
1716: whom her admiration had chosen. All Dorothea’s passion was transfused
1717: through a mind struggling towards an ideal life; the radiance of her
1718: transfigured girlhood fell on the first object that came within its
1719: level. The impetus with which inclination became resolution was
1720: heightened by those little events of the day which had roused her
1721: discontent with the actual conditions of her life.
1722: 
1723: After dinner, when Celia was playing an “air, with variations,” a small
1724: kind of tinkling which symbolized the aesthetic part of the young
1725: ladies’ education, Dorothea went up to her room to answer Mr.
1726: Casaubon’s letter. Why should she defer the answer? She wrote it over
1727: three times, not because she wished to change the wording, but because
1728: her hand was unusually uncertain, and she could not bear that Mr.
1729: Casaubon should think her handwriting bad and illegible. She piqued
1730: herself on writing a hand in which each letter was distinguishable
1731: without any large range of conjecture, and she meant to make much use
1732: of this accomplishment, to save Mr. Casaubon’s eyes. Three times she
1733: wrote.
1734: 
1735: MY DEAR MR. CASAUBON,—I am very grateful to you for loving me, and
1736: thinking me worthy to be your wife. I can look forward to no better
1737: happiness than that which would be one with yours. If I said more, it
1738: would only be the same thing written out at greater length, for I
1739: cannot now dwell on any other thought than that I may be through life
1740: 
1741: 
1742: Yours devotedly,
1743:     DOROTHEA BROOKE.
1744: 
1745: 
1746: Later in the evening she followed her uncle into the library to give
1747: him the letter, that he might send it in the morning. He was surprised,
1748: but his surprise only issued in a few moments’ silence, during which he
1749: pushed about various objects on his writing-table, and finally stood
1750: with his back to the fire, his glasses on his nose, looking at the
1751: address of Dorothea’s letter.
1752: 
1753: “Have you thought enough about this, my dear?” he said at last.
1754: 
1755: “There was no need to think long, uncle. I know of nothing to make me
1756: vacillate. If I changed my mind, it must be because of something
1757: important and entirely new to me.”
1758: 
1759: “Ah!—then you have accepted him? Then Chettam has no chance? Has
1760: Chettam offended you—offended you, you know? What is it you don’t like
1761: in Chettam?”
1762: 
1763: “There is nothing that I like in him,” said Dorothea, rather
1764: impetuously.
1765: 
1766: Mr. Brooke threw his head and shoulders backward as if some one had
1767: thrown a light missile at him. Dorothea immediately felt some
1768: self-rebuke, and said—
1769: 
1770: “I mean in the light of a husband. He is very kind, I think—really very
1771: good about the cottages. A well-meaning man.”
1772: 
1773: “But you must have a scholar, and that sort of thing? Well, it lies a
1774: little in our family. I had it myself—that love of knowledge, and going
1775: into everything—a little too much—it took me too far; though that sort
1776: of thing doesn’t often run in the female-line; or it runs underground
1777: like the rivers in Greece, you know—it comes out in the sons. Clever
1778: sons, clever mothers. I went a good deal into that, at one time.
1779: However, my dear, I have always said that people should do as they like
1780: in these things, up to a certain point. I couldn’t, as your guardian,
1781: have consented to a bad match. But Casaubon stands well: his position
1782: is good. I am afraid Chettam will be hurt, though, and Mrs. Cadwallader
1783: will blame me.”
1784: 
1785: That evening, of course, Celia knew nothing of what had happened. She
1786: attributed Dorothea’s abstracted manner, and the evidence of further
1787: crying since they had got home, to the temper she had been in about Sir
1788: James Chettam and the buildings, and was careful not to give further
1789: offence: having once said what she wanted to say, Celia had no
1790: disposition to recur to disagreeable subjects. It had been her nature
1791: when a child never to quarrel with any one—only to observe with wonder
1792: that they quarrelled with her, and looked like turkey-cocks; whereupon
1793: she was ready to play at cat’s cradle with them whenever they recovered
1794: themselves. And as to Dorothea, it had always been her way to find
1795: something wrong in her sister’s words, though Celia inwardly protested
1796: that she always said just how things were, and nothing else: she never
1797: did and never could put words together out of her own head. But the
1798: best of Dodo was, that she did not keep angry for long together. Now,
1799: though they had hardly spoken to each other all the evening, yet when
1800: Celia put by her work, intending to go to bed, a proceeding in which
1801: she was always much the earlier, Dorothea, who was seated on a low
1802: stool, unable to occupy herself except in meditation, said, with the
1803: musical intonation which in moments of deep but quiet feeling made her
1804: speech like a fine bit of recitative—
1805: 
1806: “Celia, dear, come and kiss me,” holding her arms open as she spoke.
1807: 
1808: Celia knelt down to get the right level and gave her little butterfly
1809: kiss, while Dorothea encircled her with gentle arms and pressed her
1810: lips gravely on each cheek in turn.
1811: 
1812: “Don’t sit up, Dodo, you are so pale to-night: go to bed soon,” said
1813: Celia, in a comfortable way, without any touch of pathos.
1814: 
1815: “No, dear, I am very, very happy,” said Dorothea, fervently.
1816: 
1817: “So much the better,” thought Celia. “But how strangely Dodo goes from
1818: one extreme to the other.”
1819: 
1820: The next day, at luncheon, the butler, handing something to Mr. Brooke,
1821: said, “Jonas is come back, sir, and has brought this letter.”
1822: 
1823: Mr. Brooke read the letter, and then, nodding toward Dorothea, said,
1824: “Casaubon, my dear: he will be here to dinner; he didn’t wait to write
1825: more—didn’t wait, you know.”
1826: 
1827: It could not seem remarkable to Celia that a dinner guest should be
1828: announced to her sister beforehand, but, her eyes following the same
1829: direction as her uncle’s, she was struck with the peculiar effect of
1830: the announcement on Dorothea. It seemed as if something like the
1831: reflection of a white sunlit wing had passed across her features,
1832: ending in one of her rare blushes. For the first time it entered into
1833: Celia’s mind that there might be something more between Mr. Casaubon
1834: and her sister than his delight in bookish talk and her delight in
1835: listening. Hitherto she had classed the admiration for this “ugly” and
1836: learned acquaintance with the admiration for Monsieur Liret at
1837: Lausanne, also ugly and learned. Dorothea had never been tired of
1838: listening to old Monsieur Liret when Celia’s feet were as cold as
1839: possible, and when it had really become dreadful to see the skin of his
1840: bald head moving about. Why then should her enthusiasm not extend to
1841: Mr. Casaubon simply in the same way as to Monsieur Liret? And it seemed
1842: probable that all learned men had a sort of schoolmaster’s view of
1843: young people.
1844: 
1845: But now Celia was really startled at the suspicion which had darted
1846: into her mind. She was seldom taken by surprise in this way, her
1847: marvellous quickness in observing a certain order of signs generally
1848: preparing her to expect such outward events as she had an interest in.
1849: Not that she now imagined Mr. Casaubon to be already an accepted lover:
1850: she had only begun to feel disgust at the possibility that anything in
1851: Dorothea’s mind could tend towards such an issue. Here was something
1852: really to vex her about Dodo: it was all very well not to accept Sir
1853: James Chettam, but the idea of marrying Mr. Casaubon! Celia felt a sort
1854: of shame mingled with a sense of the ludicrous. But perhaps Dodo, if
1855: she were really bordering on such an extravagance, might be turned away
1856: from it: experience had often shown that her impressibility might be
1857: calculated on. The day was damp, and they were not going to walk out,
1858: so they both went up to their sitting-room; and there Celia observed
1859: that Dorothea, instead of settling down with her usual diligent
1860: interest to some occupation, simply leaned her elbow on an open book
1861: and looked out of the window at the great cedar silvered with the damp.
1862: She herself had taken up the making of a toy for the curate’s children,
1863: and was not going to enter on any subject too precipitately.
1864: 
1865: Dorothea was in fact thinking that it was desirable for Celia to know
1866: of the momentous change in Mr. Casaubon’s position since he had last
1867: been in the house: it did not seem fair to leave her in ignorance of
1868: what would necessarily affect her attitude towards him; but it was
1869: impossible not to shrink from telling her. Dorothea accused herself of
1870: some meanness in this timidity: it was always odious to her to have any
1871: small fears or contrivances about her actions, but at this moment she
1872: was seeking the highest aid possible that she might not dread the
1873: corrosiveness of Celia’s pretty carnally minded prose. Her reverie was
1874: broken, and the difficulty of decision banished, by Celia’s small and
1875: rather guttural voice speaking in its usual tone, of a remark aside or
1876: a “by the bye.”
1877: 
1878: “Is any one else coming to dine besides Mr. Casaubon?”
1879: 
1880: “Not that I know of.”
1881: 
1882: “I hope there is some one else. Then I shall not hear him eat his soup
1883: so.”
1884: 
1885: “What is there remarkable about his soup-eating?”
1886: 
1887: “Really, Dodo, can’t you hear how he scrapes his spoon? And he always
1888: blinks before he speaks. I don’t know whether Locke blinked, but I’m
1889: sure I am sorry for those who sat opposite to him if he did.”
1890: 
1891: “Celia,” said Dorothea, with emphatic gravity, “pray don’t make any
1892: more observations of that kind.”
1893: 
1894: “Why not? They are quite true,” returned Celia, who had her reasons for
1895: persevering, though she was beginning to be a little afraid.
1896: 
1897: “Many things are true which only the commonest minds observe.”
1898: 
1899: “Then I think the commonest minds must be rather useful. I think it is
1900: a pity Mr. Casaubon’s mother had not a commoner mind: she might have
1901: taught him better.” Celia was inwardly frightened, and ready to run
1902: away, now she had hurled this light javelin.
1903: 
1904: Dorothea’s feelings had gathered to an avalanche, and there could be no
1905: further preparation.
1906: 
1907: “It is right to tell you, Celia, that I am engaged to marry Mr.
1908: Casaubon.”
1909: 
1910: Perhaps Celia had never turned so pale before. The paper man she was
1911: making would have had his leg injured, but for her habitual care of
1912: whatever she held in her hands. She laid the fragile figure down at
1913: once, and sat perfectly still for a few moments. When she spoke there
1914: was a tear gathering.
1915: 
1916: “Oh, Dodo, I hope you will be happy.” Her sisterly tenderness could not
1917: but surmount other feelings at this moment, and her fears were the
1918: fears of affection.
1919: 
1920: Dorothea was still hurt and agitated.
1921: 
1922: “It is quite decided, then?” said Celia, in an awed under tone. “And
1923: uncle knows?”
1924: 
1925: “I have accepted Mr. Casaubon’s offer. My uncle brought me the letter
1926: that contained it; he knew about it beforehand.”
1927: 
1928: “I beg your pardon, if I have said anything to hurt you, Dodo,” said
1929: Celia, with a slight sob. She never could have thought that she should
1930: feel as she did. There was something funereal in the whole affair, and
1931: Mr. Casaubon seemed to be the officiating clergyman, about whom it
1932: would be indecent to make remarks.
1933: 
1934: “Never mind, Kitty, do not grieve. We should never admire the same
1935: people. I often offend in something of the same way; I am apt to speak
1936: too strongly of those who don’t please me.”
1937: 
1938: In spite of this magnanimity Dorothea was still smarting: perhaps as
1939: much from Celia’s subdued astonishment as from her small criticisms. Of
1940: course all the world round Tipton would be out of sympathy with this
1941: marriage. Dorothea knew of no one who thought as she did about life and
1942: its best objects.
1943: 
1944: Nevertheless before the evening was at an end she was very happy. In an
1945: hour’s _tête-à-tête_ with Mr. Casaubon she talked to him with more
1946: freedom than she had ever felt before, even pouring out her joy at the
1947: thought of devoting herself to him, and of learning how she might best
1948: share and further all his great ends. Mr. Casaubon was touched with an
1949: unknown delight (what man would not have been?) at this childlike
1950: unrestrained ardor: he was not surprised (what lover would have been?)
1951: that he should be the object of it.
1952: 
1953: “My dear young lady—Miss Brooke—Dorothea!” he said, pressing her hand
1954: between his hands, “this is a happiness greater than I had ever
1955: imagined to be in reserve for me. That I should ever meet with a mind
1956: and person so rich in the mingled graces which could render marriage
1957: desirable, was far indeed from my conception. You have all—nay, more
1958: than all—those qualities which I have ever regarded as the
1959: characteristic excellences of womanhood. The great charm of your sex is
1960: its capability of an ardent self-sacrificing affection, and herein we
1961: see its fitness to round and complete the existence of our own.
1962: Hitherto I have known few pleasures save of the severer kind: my
1963: satisfactions have been those of the solitary student. I have been
1964: little disposed to gather flowers that would wither in my hand, but now
1965: I shall pluck them with eagerness, to place them in your bosom.”
1966: 
1967: No speech could have been more thoroughly honest in its intention: the
1968: frigid rhetoric at the end was as sincere as the bark of a dog, or the
1969: cawing of an amorous rook. Would it not be rash to conclude that there
1970: was no passion behind those sonnets to Delia which strike us as the
1971: thin music of a mandolin?
1972: 
1973: Dorothea’s faith supplied all that Mr. Casaubon’s words seemed to leave
1974: unsaid: what believer sees a disturbing omission or infelicity? The
1975: text, whether of prophet or of poet, expands for whatever we can put
1976: into it, and even his bad grammar is sublime.
1977: 
1978: “I am very ignorant—you will quite wonder at my ignorance,” said
1979: Dorothea. “I have so many thoughts that may be quite mistaken; and now
1980: I shall be able to tell them all to you, and ask you about them. But,”
1981: she added, with rapid imagination of Mr. Casaubon’s probable feeling,
1982: “I will not trouble you too much; only when you are inclined to listen
1983: to me. You must often be weary with the pursuit of subjects in your own
1984: track. I shall gain enough if you will take me with you there.”
1985: 
1986: “How should I be able now to persevere in any path without your
1987: companionship?” said Mr. Casaubon, kissing her candid brow, and feeling
1988: that heaven had vouchsafed him a blessing in every way suited to his
1989: peculiar wants. He was being unconsciously wrought upon by the charms
1990: of a nature which was entirely without hidden calculations either for
1991: immediate effects or for remoter ends. It was this which made Dorothea
1992: so childlike, and, according to some judges, so stupid, with all her
1993: reputed cleverness; as, for example, in the present case of throwing
1994: herself, metaphorically speaking, at Mr. Casaubon’s feet, and kissing
1995: his unfashionable shoe-ties as if he were a Protestant Pope. She was
1996: not in the least teaching Mr. Casaubon to ask if he were good enough
1997: for her, but merely asking herself anxiously how she could be good
1998: enough for Mr. Casaubon. Before he left the next day it had been
1999: decided that the marriage should take place within six weeks. Why not?
2000: Mr. Casaubon’s house was ready. It was not a parsonage, but a
2001: considerable mansion, with much land attached to it. The parsonage was
2002: inhabited by the curate, who did all the duty except preaching the
2003: morning sermon.
2004: 
2005: 
2006: 
2007: 
2008: CHAPTER VI.
2009: 
2010: My lady’s tongue is like the meadow blades,
2011: That cut you stroking them with idle hand.
2012: Nice cutting is her function: she divides
2013: With spiritual edge the millet-seed,
2014: And makes intangible savings.
2015: 
2016: 
2017: As Mr. Casaubon’s carriage was passing out of the gateway, it arrested
2018: the entrance of a pony phaeton driven by a lady with a servant seated
2019: behind. It was doubtful whether the recognition had been mutual, for
2020: Mr. Casaubon was looking absently before him; but the lady was
2021: quick-eyed, and threw a nod and a “How do you do?” in the nick of time.
2022: In spite of her shabby bonnet and very old Indian shawl, it was plain
2023: that the lodge-keeper regarded her as an important personage, from the
2024: low curtsy which was dropped on the entrance of the small phaeton.
2025: 
2026: “Well, Mrs. Fitchett, how are your fowls laying now?” said the
2027: high-colored, dark-eyed lady, with the clearest chiselled utterance.
2028: 
2029: “Pretty well for laying, madam, but they’ve ta’en to eating their eggs:
2030: I’ve no peace o’ mind with ’em at all.”
2031: 
2032: “Oh, the cannibals! Better sell them cheap at once. What will you sell
2033: them a couple? One can’t eat fowls of a bad character at a high price.”
2034: 
2035: “Well, madam, half-a-crown: I couldn’t let ’em go, not under.”
2036: 
2037: “Half-a-crown, these times! Come now—for the Rector’s chicken-broth on
2038: a Sunday. He has consumed all ours that I can spare. You are half paid
2039: with the sermon, Mrs. Fitchett, remember that. Take a pair of
2040: tumbler-pigeons for them—little beauties. You must come and see them.
2041: You have no tumblers among your pigeons.”
2042: 
2043: “Well, madam, Master Fitchett shall go and see ’em after work. He’s
2044: very hot on new sorts; to oblige you.”
2045: 
2046: “Oblige me! It will be the best bargain he ever made. A pair of church
2047: pigeons for a couple of wicked Spanish fowls that eat their own eggs!
2048: Don’t you and Fitchett boast too much, that is all!”
2049: 
2050: The phaeton was driven onwards with the last words, leaving Mrs.
2051: Fitchett laughing and shaking her head slowly, with an interjectional
2052: “Sure_ly_, sure_ly_!”—from which it might be inferred that she would
2053: have found the country-side somewhat duller if the Rector’s lady had
2054: been less free-spoken and less of a skinflint. Indeed, both the farmers
2055: and laborers in the parishes of Freshitt and Tipton would have felt a
2056: sad lack of conversation but for the stories about what Mrs.
2057: Cadwallader said and did: a lady of immeasurably high birth, descended,
2058: as it were, from unknown earls, dim as the crowd of heroic shades—who
2059: pleaded poverty, pared down prices, and cut jokes in the most
2060: companionable manner, though with a turn of tongue that let you know
2061: who she was. Such a lady gave a neighborliness to both rank and
2062: religion, and mitigated the bitterness of uncommuted tithe. A much more
2063: exemplary character with an infusion of sour dignity would not have
2064: furthered their comprehension of the Thirty-nine Articles, and would
2065: have been less socially uniting.
2066: 
2067: Mr. Brooke, seeing Mrs. Cadwallader’s merits from a different point of
2068: view, winced a little when her name was announced in the library, where
2069: he was sitting alone.
2070: 
2071: “I see you have had our Lowick Cicero here,” she said, seating herself
2072: comfortably, throwing back her wraps, and showing a thin but well-built
2073: figure. “I suspect you and he are brewing some bad polities, else you
2074: would not be seeing so much of the lively man. I shall inform against
2075: you: remember you are both suspicious characters since you took Peel’s
2076: side about the Catholic Bill. I shall tell everybody that you are going
2077: to put up for Middlemarch on the Whig side when old Pinkerton resigns,
2078: and that Casaubon is going to help you in an underhand manner: going to
2079: bribe the voters with pamphlets, and throw open the public-houses to
2080: distribute them. Come, confess!”
2081: 
2082: “Nothing of the sort,” said Mr. Brooke, smiling and rubbing his
2083: eye-glasses, but really blushing a little at the impeachment. “Casaubon
2084: and I don’t talk politics much. He doesn’t care much about the
2085: philanthropic side of things; punishments, and that kind of thing. He
2086: only cares about Church questions. That is not my line of action, you
2087: know.”
2088: 
2089: “Ra-a-ther too much, my friend. I have heard of your doings. Who was it
2090: that sold his bit of land to the Papists at Middlemarch? I believe you
2091: bought it on purpose. You are a perfect Guy Faux. See if you are not
2092: burnt in effigy this 5th of November coming. Humphrey would not come to
2093: quarrel with you about it, so I am come.”
2094: 
2095: “Very good. I was prepared to be persecuted for not persecuting—not
2096: persecuting, you know.”
2097: 
2098: “There you go! That is a piece of clap-trap you have got ready for the
2099: hustings. Now, _do not_ let them lure you to the hustings, my dear Mr.
2100: Brooke. A man always makes a fool of himself, speechifying: there’s no
2101: excuse but being on the right side, so that you can ask a blessing on
2102: your humming and hawing. You will lose yourself, I forewarn you. You
2103: will make a Saturday pie of all parties’ opinions, and be pelted by
2104: everybody.”
2105: 
2106: “That is what I expect, you know,” said Mr. Brooke, not wishing to
2107: betray how little he enjoyed this prophetic sketch—“what I expect as an
2108: independent man. As to the Whigs, a man who goes with the thinkers is
2109: not likely to be hooked on by any party. He may go with them up to a
2110: certain point—up to a certain point, you know. But that is what you
2111: ladies never understand.”
2112: 
2113: “Where your certain point is? No. I should like to be told how a man
2114: can have any certain point when he belongs to no party—leading a roving
2115: life, and never letting his friends know his address. ‘Nobody knows
2116: where Brooke will be—there’s no counting on Brooke’—that is what people
2117: say of you, to be quite frank. Now, do turn respectable. How will you
2118: like going to Sessions with everybody looking shy on you, and you with
2119: a bad conscience and an empty pocket?”
2120: 
2121: “I don’t pretend to argue with a lady on politics,” said Mr. Brooke,
2122: with an air of smiling indifference, but feeling rather unpleasantly
2123: conscious that this attack of Mrs. Cadwallader’s had opened the
2124: defensive campaign to which certain rash steps had exposed him. “Your
2125: sex are not thinkers, you know—_varium et mutabile semper_—that kind of
2126: thing. You don’t know Virgil. I knew”—Mr. Brooke reflected in time that
2127: he had not had the personal acquaintance of the Augustan poet—“I was
2128: going to say, poor Stoddart, you know. That was what _he_ said. You
2129: ladies are always against an independent attitude—a man’s caring for
2130: nothing but truth, and that sort of thing. And there is no part of the
2131: county where opinion is narrower than it is here—I don’t mean to throw
2132: stones, you know, but somebody is wanted to take the independent line;
2133: and if I don’t take it, who will?”
2134: 
2135: “Who? Why, any upstart who has got neither blood nor position. People
2136: of standing should consume their independent nonsense at home, not hawk
2137: it about. And you! who are going to marry your niece, as good as your
2138: daughter, to one of our best men. Sir James would be cruelly annoyed:
2139: it will be too hard on him if you turn round now and make yourself a
2140: Whig sign-board.”
2141: 
2142: Mr. Brooke again winced inwardly, for Dorothea’s engagement had no
2143: sooner been decided, than he had thought of Mrs. Cadwallader’s
2144: prospective taunts. It might have been easy for ignorant observers to
2145: say, “Quarrel with Mrs. Cadwallader;” but where is a country gentleman
2146: to go who quarrels with his oldest neighbors? Who could taste the fine
2147: flavor in the name of Brooke if it were delivered casually, like wine
2148: without a seal? Certainly a man can only be cosmopolitan up to a
2149: certain point.
2150: 
2151: “I hope Chettam and I shall always be good friends; but I am sorry to
2152: say there is no prospect of his marrying my niece,” said Mr. Brooke,
2153: much relieved to see through the window that Celia was coming in.
2154: 
2155: “Why not?” said Mrs. Cadwallader, with a sharp note of surprise. “It is
2156: hardly a fortnight since you and I were talking about it.”
2157: 
2158: “My niece has chosen another suitor—has chosen him, you know. I have
2159: had nothing to do with it. I should have preferred Chettam; and I
2160: should have said Chettam was the man any girl would have chosen. But
2161: there is no accounting for these things. Your sex is capricious, you
2162: know.”
2163: 
2164: “Why, whom do you mean to say that you are going to let her marry?”
2165: Mrs. Cadwallader’s mind was rapidly surveying the possibilities of
2166: choice for Dorothea.
2167: 
2168: But here Celia entered, blooming from a walk in the garden, and the
2169: greeting with her delivered Mr. Brooke from the necessity of answering
2170: immediately. He got up hastily, and saying, “By the way, I must speak
2171: to Wright about the horses,” shuffled quickly out of the room.
2172: 
2173: “My dear child, what is this?—this about your sister’s engagement?”
2174: said Mrs. Cadwallader.
2175: 
2176: “She is engaged to marry Mr. Casaubon,” said Celia, resorting, as
2177: usual, to the simplest statement of fact, and enjoying this opportunity
2178: of speaking to the Rector’s wife alone.
2179: 
2180: “This is frightful. How long has it been going on?”
2181: 
2182: “I only knew of it yesterday. They are to be married in six weeks.”
2183: 
2184: “Well, my dear, I wish you joy of your brother-in-law.”
2185: 
2186: “I am so sorry for Dorothea.”
2187: 
2188: “Sorry! It is her doing, I suppose.”
2189: 
2190: “Yes; she says Mr. Casaubon has a great soul.”
2191: 
2192: “With all my heart.”
2193: 
2194: “Oh, Mrs. Cadwallader, I don’t think it can be nice to marry a man with
2195: a great soul.”
2196: 
2197: “Well, my dear, take warning. You know the look of one now; when the
2198: next comes and wants to marry you, don’t you accept him.”
2199: 
2200: “I’m sure I never should.”
2201: 
2202: “No; one such in a family is enough. So your sister never cared about
2203: Sir James Chettam? What would you have said to _him_ for a
2204: brother-in-law?”
2205: 
2206: “I should have liked that very much. I am sure he would have been a
2207: good husband. Only,” Celia added, with a slight blush (she sometimes
2208: seemed to blush as she breathed), “I don’t think he would have suited
2209: Dorothea.”
2210: 
2211: “Not high-flown enough?”
2212: 
2213: “Dodo is very strict. She thinks so much about everything, and is so
2214: particular about what one says. Sir James never seemed to please her.”
2215: 
2216: “She must have encouraged him, I am sure. That is not very creditable.”
2217: 
2218: “Please don’t be angry with Dodo; she does not see things. She thought
2219: so much about the cottages, and she was rude to Sir James sometimes;
2220: but he is so kind, he never noticed it.”
2221: 
2222: “Well,” said Mrs. Cadwallader, putting on her shawl, and rising, as if
2223: in haste, “I must go straight to Sir James and break this to him. He
2224: will have brought his mother back by this time, and I must call. Your
2225: uncle will never tell him. We are all disappointed, my dear. Young
2226: people should think of their families in marrying. I set a bad
2227: example—married a poor clergyman, and made myself a pitiable object
2228: among the De Bracys—obliged to get my coals by stratagem, and pray to
2229: heaven for my salad oil. However, Casaubon has money enough; I must do
2230: him that justice. As to his blood, I suppose the family quarterings are
2231: three cuttle-fish sable, and a commentator rampant. By the bye, before
2232: I go, my dear, I must speak to your Mrs. Carter about pastry. I want to
2233: send my young cook to learn of her. Poor people with four children,
2234: like us, you know, can’t afford to keep a good cook. I have no doubt
2235: Mrs. Carter will oblige me. Sir James’s cook is a perfect dragon.”
2236: 
2237: In less than an hour, Mrs. Cadwallader had circumvented Mrs. Carter and
2238: driven to Freshitt Hall, which was not far from her own parsonage, her
2239: husband being resident in Freshitt and keeping a curate in Tipton.
2240: 
2241: Sir James Chettam had returned from the short journey which had kept
2242: him absent for a couple of days, and had changed his dress, intending
2243: to ride over to Tipton Grange. His horse was standing at the door when
2244: Mrs. Cadwallader drove up, and he immediately appeared there himself,
2245: whip in hand. Lady Chettam had not yet returned, but Mrs. Cadwallader’s
2246: errand could not be despatched in the presence of grooms, so she asked
2247: to be taken into the conservatory close by, to look at the new plants;
2248: and on coming to a contemplative stand, she said—
2249: 
2250: “I have a great shock for you; I hope you are not so far gone in love
2251: as you pretended to be.”
2252: 
2253: It was of no use protesting against Mrs. Cadwallader’s way of putting
2254: things. But Sir James’s countenance changed a little. He felt a vague
2255: alarm.
2256: 
2257: “I do believe Brooke is going to expose himself after all. I accused
2258: him of meaning to stand for Middlemarch on the Liberal side, and he
2259: looked silly and never denied it—talked about the independent line, and
2260: the usual nonsense.”
2261: 
2262: “Is that all?” said Sir James, much relieved.
2263: 
2264: “Why,” rejoined Mrs. Cadwallader, with a sharper note, “you don’t mean
2265: to say that you would like him to turn public man in that way—making a
2266: sort of political Cheap Jack of himself?”
2267: 
2268: “He might be dissuaded, I should think. He would not like the expense.”
2269: 
2270: “That is what I told him. He is vulnerable to reason there—always a few
2271: grains of common-sense in an ounce of miserliness. Miserliness is a
2272: capital quality to run in families; it’s the safe side for madness to
2273: dip on. And there must be a little crack in the Brooke family, else we
2274: should not see what we are to see.”
2275: 
2276: “What? Brooke standing for Middlemarch?”
2277: 
2278: “Worse than that. I really feel a little responsible. I always told you
2279: Miss Brooke would be such a fine match. I knew there was a great deal
2280: of nonsense in her—a flighty sort of Methodistical stuff. But these
2281: things wear out of girls. However, I am taken by surprise for once.”
2282: 
2283: “What do you mean, Mrs. Cadwallader?” said Sir James. His fear lest
2284: Miss Brooke should have run away to join the Moravian Brethren, or some
2285: preposterous sect unknown to good society, was a little allayed by the
2286: knowledge that Mrs. Cadwallader always made the worst of things. “What
2287: has happened to Miss Brooke? Pray speak out.”
2288: 
2289: “Very well. She is engaged to be married.” Mrs. Cadwallader paused a
2290: few moments, observing the deeply hurt expression in her friend’s face,
2291: which he was trying to conceal by a nervous smile, while he whipped his
2292: boot; but she soon added, “Engaged to Casaubon.”
2293: 
2294: Sir James let his whip fall and stooped to pick it up. Perhaps his face
2295: had never before gathered so much concentrated disgust as when he
2296: turned to Mrs. Cadwallader and repeated, “Casaubon?”
2297: 
2298: “Even so. You know my errand now.”
2299: 
2300: “Good God! It is horrible! He is no better than a mummy!” (The point of
2301: view has to be allowed for, as that of a blooming and disappointed
2302: rival.)
2303: 
2304: “She says, he is a great soul.—A great bladder for dried peas to rattle
2305: in!” said Mrs. Cadwallader.
2306: 
2307: “What business has an old bachelor like that to marry?” said Sir James.
2308: “He has one foot in the grave.”
2309: 
2310: “He means to draw it out again, I suppose.”
2311: 
2312: “Brooke ought not to allow it: he should insist on its being put off
2313: till she is of age. She would think better of it then. What is a
2314: guardian for?”
2315: 
2316: “As if you could ever squeeze a resolution out of Brooke!”
2317: 
2318: “Cadwallader might talk to him.”
2319: 
2320: “Not he! Humphrey finds everybody charming. I never can get him to
2321: abuse Casaubon. He will even speak well of the bishop, though I tell
2322: him it is unnatural in a beneficed clergyman; what can one do with a
2323: husband who attends so little to the decencies? I hide it as well as I
2324: can by abusing everybody myself. Come, come, cheer up! you are well rid
2325: of Miss Brooke, a girl who would have been requiring you to see the
2326: stars by daylight. Between ourselves, little Celia is worth two of her,
2327: and likely after all to be the better match. For this marriage to
2328: Casaubon is as good as going to a nunnery.”
2329: 
2330: “Oh, on my own account—it is for Miss Brooke’s sake I think her friends
2331: should try to use their influence.”
2332: 
2333: “Well, Humphrey doesn’t know yet. But when I tell him, you may depend
2334: on it he will say, ‘Why not? Casaubon is a good fellow—and young—young
2335: enough.’ These charitable people never know vinegar from wine till they
2336: have swallowed it and got the colic. However, if I were a man I should
2337: prefer Celia, especially when Dorothea was gone. The truth is, you have
2338: been courting one and have won the other. I can see that she admires
2339: you almost as much as a man expects to be admired. If it were any one
2340: but me who said so, you might think it exaggeration. Good-by!”
2341: 
2342: Sir James handed Mrs. Cadwallader to the phaeton, and then jumped on
2343: his horse. He was not going to renounce his ride because of his
2344: friend’s unpleasant news—only to ride the faster in some other
2345: direction than that of Tipton Grange.
2346: 
2347: Now, why on earth should Mrs. Cadwallader have been at all busy about
2348: Miss Brooke’s marriage; and why, when one match that she liked to think
2349: she had a hand in was frustrated, should she have straightway contrived
2350: the preliminaries of another? Was there any ingenious plot, any
2351: hide-and-seek course of action, which might be detected by a careful
2352: telescopic watch? Not at all: a telescope might have swept the parishes
2353: of Tipton and Freshitt, the whole area visited by Mrs. Cadwallader in
2354: her phaeton, without witnessing any interview that could excite
2355: suspicion, or any scene from which she did not return with the same
2356: unperturbed keenness of eye and the same high natural color. In fact,
2357: if that convenient vehicle had existed in the days of the Seven Sages,
2358: one of them would doubtless have remarked, that you can know little of
2359: women by following them about in their pony-phaetons. Even with a
2360: microscope directed on a water-drop we find ourselves making
2361: interpretations which turn out to be rather coarse; for whereas under a
2362: weak lens you may seem to see a creature exhibiting an active voracity
2363: into which other smaller creatures actively play as if they were so
2364: many animated tax-pennies, a stronger lens reveals to you certain
2365: tiniest hairlets which make vortices for these victims while the
2366: swallower waits passively at his receipt of custom. In this way,
2367: metaphorically speaking, a strong lens applied to Mrs. Cadwallader’s
2368: match-making will show a play of minute causes producing what may be
2369: called thought and speech vortices to bring her the sort of food she
2370: needed. Her life was rurally simple, quite free from secrets either
2371: foul, dangerous, or otherwise important, and not consciously affected
2372: by the great affairs of the world. All the more did the affairs of the
2373: great world interest her, when communicated in the letters of high-born
2374: relations: the way in which fascinating younger sons had gone to the
2375: dogs by marrying their mistresses; the fine old-blooded idiocy of young
2376: Lord Tapir, and the furious gouty humors of old Lord Megatherium; the
2377: exact crossing of genealogies which had brought a coronet into a new
2378: branch and widened the relations of scandal,—these were topics of which
2379: she retained details with the utmost accuracy, and reproduced them in
2380: an excellent pickle of epigrams, which she herself enjoyed the more
2381: because she believed as unquestionably in birth and no-birth as she did
2382: in game and vermin. She would never have disowned any one on the ground
2383: of poverty: a De Bracy reduced to take his dinner in a basin would have
2384: seemed to her an example of pathos worth exaggerating, and I fear his
2385: aristocratic vices would not have horrified her. But her feeling
2386: towards the vulgar rich was a sort of religious hatred: they had
2387: probably made all their money out of high retail prices, and Mrs.
2388: Cadwallader detested high prices for everything that was not paid in
2389: kind at the Rectory: such people were no part of God’s design in making
2390: the world; and their accent was an affliction to the ears. A town where
2391: such monsters abounded was hardly more than a sort of low comedy, which
2392: could not be taken account of in a well-bred scheme of the universe.
2393: Let any lady who is inclined to be hard on Mrs. Cadwallader inquire
2394: into the comprehensiveness of her own beautiful views, and be quite
2395: sure that they afford accommodation for all the lives which have the
2396: honor to coexist with hers.
2397: 
2398: With such a mind, active as phosphorus, biting everything that came
2399: near into the form that suited it, how could Mrs. Cadwallader feel that
2400: the Miss Brookes and their matrimonial prospects were alien to her?
2401: especially as it had been the habit of years for her to scold Mr.
2402: Brooke with the friendliest frankness, and let him know in confidence
2403: that she thought him a poor creature. From the first arrival of the
2404: young ladies in Tipton she had prearranged Dorothea’s marriage with Sir
2405: James, and if it had taken place would have been quite sure that it was
2406: her doing: that it should not take place after she had preconceived it,
2407: caused her an irritation which every thinker will sympathize with. She
2408: was the diplomatist of Tipton and Freshitt, and for anything to happen
2409: in spite of her was an offensive irregularity. As to freaks like this
2410: of Miss Brooke’s, Mrs. Cadwallader had no patience with them, and now
2411: saw that her opinion of this girl had been infected with some of her
2412: husband’s weak charitableness: those Methodistical whims, that air of
2413: being more religious than the rector and curate together, came from a
2414: deeper and more constitutional disease than she had been willing to
2415: believe.
2416: 
2417: “However,” said Mrs. Cadwallader, first to herself and afterwards to
2418: her husband, “I throw her over: there was a chance, if she had married
2419: Sir James, of her becoming a sane, sensible woman. He would never have
2420: contradicted her, and when a woman is not contradicted, she has no
2421: motive for obstinacy in her absurdities. But now I wish her joy of her
2422: hair shirt.”
2423: 
2424: It followed that Mrs. Cadwallader must decide on another match for Sir
2425: James, and having made up her mind that it was to be the younger Miss
2426: Brooke, there could not have been a more skilful move towards the
2427: success of her plan than her hint to the baronet that he had made an
2428: impression on Celia’s heart. For he was not one of those gentlemen who
2429: languish after the unattainable Sappho’s apple that laughs from the
2430: topmost bough—the charms which
2431: 
2432: “Smile like the knot of cowslips on the cliff,
2433: Not to be come at by the willing hand.”
2434: 
2435: 
2436: He had no sonnets to write, and it could not strike him agreeably that
2437: he was not an object of preference to the woman whom he had preferred.
2438: Already the knowledge that Dorothea had chosen Mr. Casaubon had bruised
2439: his attachment and relaxed its hold. Although Sir James was a
2440: sportsman, he had some other feelings towards women than towards grouse
2441: and foxes, and did not regard his future wife in the light of prey,
2442: valuable chiefly for the excitements of the chase. Neither was he so
2443: well acquainted with the habits of primitive races as to feel that an
2444: ideal combat for her, tomahawk in hand, so to speak, was necessary to
2445: the historical continuity of the marriage-tie. On the contrary, having
2446: the amiable vanity which knits us to those who are fond of us, and
2447: disinclines us to those who are indifferent, and also a good grateful
2448: nature, the mere idea that a woman had a kindness towards him spun
2449: little threads of tenderness from out his heart towards hers.
2450: 
2451: Thus it happened, that after Sir James had ridden rather fast for half
2452: an hour in a direction away from Tipton Grange, he slackened his pace,
2453: and at last turned into a road which would lead him back by a shorter
2454: cut. Various feelings wrought in him the determination after all to go
2455: to the Grange to-day as if nothing new had happened. He could not help
2456: rejoicing that he had never made the offer and been rejected; mere
2457: friendly politeness required that he should call to see Dorothea about
2458: the cottages, and now happily Mrs. Cadwallader had prepared him to
2459: offer his congratulations, if necessary, without showing too much
2460: awkwardness. He really did not like it: giving up Dorothea was very
2461: painful to him; but there was something in the resolve to make this
2462: visit forthwith and conquer all show of feeling, which was a sort of
2463: file-biting and counter-irritant. And without his distinctly
2464: recognizing the impulse, there certainly was present in him the sense
2465: that Celia would be there, and that he should pay her more attention
2466: than he had done before.
2467: 
2468: We mortals, men and women, devour many a disappointment between
2469: breakfast and dinner-time; keep back the tears and look a little pale
2470: about the lips, and in answer to inquiries say, “Oh, nothing!” Pride
2471: helps us; and pride is not a bad thing when it only urges us to hide
2472: our own hurts—not to hurt others.
2473: 
2474: 
2475: 
2476: 
2477: CHAPTER VII.
2478: 
2479: “Piacer e popone
2480: Vuol la sua stagione.”
2481: —_Italian Proverb_.
2482: 
2483: 
2484: Mr. Casaubon, as might be expected, spent a great deal of his time at
2485: the Grange in these weeks, and the hindrance which courtship occasioned
2486: to the progress of his great work—the Key to all Mythologies—naturally
2487: made him look forward the more eagerly to the happy termination of
2488: courtship. But he had deliberately incurred the hindrance, having made
2489: up his mind that it was now time for him to adorn his life with the
2490: graces of female companionship, to irradiate the gloom which fatigue
2491: was apt to hang over the intervals of studious labor with the play of
2492: female fancy, and to secure in this, his culminating age, the solace of
2493: female tendance for his declining years. Hence he determined to abandon
2494: himself to the stream of feeling, and perhaps was surprised to find
2495: what an exceedingly shallow rill it was. As in droughty regions baptism
2496: by immersion could only be performed symbolically, Mr. Casaubon found
2497: that sprinkling was the utmost approach to a plunge which his stream
2498: would afford him; and he concluded that the poets had much exaggerated
2499: the force of masculine passion. Nevertheless, he observed with pleasure
2500: that Miss Brooke showed an ardent submissive affection which promised
2501: to fulfil his most agreeable previsions of marriage. It had once or
2502: twice crossed his mind that possibly there was some deficiency in
2503: Dorothea to account for the moderation of his abandonment; but he was
2504: unable to discern the deficiency, or to figure to himself a woman who
2505: would have pleased him better; so that there was clearly no reason to
2506: fall back upon but the exaggerations of human tradition.
2507: 
2508: “Could I not be preparing myself now to be more useful?” said Dorothea
2509: to him, one morning, early in the time of courtship; “could I not learn
2510: to read Latin and Greek aloud to you, as Milton’s daughters did to
2511: their father, without understanding what they read?”
2512: 
2513: “I fear that would be wearisome to you,” said Mr. Casaubon, smiling;
2514: “and, indeed, if I remember rightly, the young women you have mentioned
2515: regarded that exercise in unknown tongues as a ground for rebellion
2516: against the poet.”
2517: 
2518: “Yes; but in the first place they were very naughty girls, else they
2519: would have been proud to minister to such a father; and in the second
2520: place they might have studied privately and taught themselves to
2521: understand what they read, and then it would have been interesting. I
2522: hope you don’t expect me to be naughty and stupid?”
2523: 
2524: “I expect you to be all that an exquisite young lady can be in every
2525: possible relation of life. Certainly it might be a great advantage if
2526: you were able to copy the Greek character, and to that end it were well
2527: to begin with a little reading.”
2528: 
2529: Dorothea seized this as a precious permission. She would not have asked
2530: Mr. Casaubon at once to teach her the languages, dreading of all things
2531: to be tiresome instead of helpful; but it was not entirely out of
2532: devotion to her future husband that she wished to know Latin and Greek.
2533: Those provinces of masculine knowledge seemed to her a standing-ground
2534: from which all truth could be seen more truly. As it was, she
2535: constantly doubted her own conclusions, because she felt her own
2536: ignorance: how could she be confident that one-roomed cottages were not
2537: for the glory of God, when men who knew the classics appeared to
2538: conciliate indifference to the cottages with zeal for the glory?
2539: Perhaps even Hebrew might be necessary—at least the alphabet and a few
2540: roots—in order to arrive at the core of things, and judge soundly on
2541: the social duties of the Christian. And she had not reached that point
2542: of renunciation at which she would have been satisfied with having a
2543: wise husband: she wished, poor child, to be wise herself. Miss Brooke
2544: was certainly very naive with all her alleged cleverness. Celia, whose
2545: mind had never been thought too powerful, saw the emptiness of other
2546: people’s pretensions much more readily. To have in general but little
2547: feeling, seems to be the only security against feeling too much on any
2548: particular occasion.
2549: 
2550: However, Mr. Casaubon consented to listen and teach for an hour
2551: together, like a schoolmaster of little boys, or rather like a lover,
2552: to whom a mistress’s elementary ignorance and difficulties have a
2553: touching fitness. Few scholars would have disliked teaching the
2554: alphabet under such circumstances. But Dorothea herself was a little
2555: shocked and discouraged at her own stupidity, and the answers she got
2556: to some timid questions about the value of the Greek accents gave her a
2557: painful suspicion that here indeed there might be secrets not capable
2558: of explanation to a woman’s reason.
2559: 
2560: Mr. Brooke had no doubt on that point, and expressed himself with his
2561: usual strength upon it one day that he came into the library while the
2562: reading was going forward.
2563: 
2564: “Well, but now, Casaubon, such deep studies, classics, mathematics,
2565: that kind of thing, are too taxing for a woman—too taxing, you know.”
2566: 
2567: “Dorothea is learning to read the characters simply,” said Mr.
2568: Casaubon, evading the question. “She had the very considerate thought
2569: of saving my eyes.”
2570: 
2571: “Ah, well, without understanding, you know—that may not be so bad. But
2572: there is a lightness about the feminine mind—a touch and go—music, the
2573: fine arts, that kind of thing—they should study those up to a certain
2574: point, women should; but in a light way, you know. A woman should be
2575: able to sit down and play you or sing you a good old English tune. That
2576: is what I like; though I have heard most things—been at the opera in
2577: Vienna: Gluck, Mozart, everything of that sort. But I’m a conservative
2578: in music—it’s not like ideas, you know. I stick to the good old tunes.”
2579: 
2580: “Mr. Casaubon is not fond of the piano, and I am very glad he is not,”
2581: said Dorothea, whose slight regard for domestic music and feminine fine
2582: art must be forgiven her, considering the small tinkling and smearing
2583: in which they chiefly consisted at that dark period. She smiled and
2584: looked up at her betrothed with grateful eyes. If he had always been
2585: asking her to play the “Last Rose of Summer,” she would have required
2586: much resignation. “He says there is only an old harpsichord at Lowick,
2587: and it is covered with books.”
2588: 
2589: “Ah, there you are behind Celia, my dear. Celia, now, plays very
2590: prettily, and is always ready to play. However, since Casaubon does not
2591: like it, you are all right. But it’s a pity you should not have little
2592: recreations of that sort, Casaubon: the bow always strung—that kind of
2593: thing, you know—will not do.”
2594: 
2595: “I never could look on it in the light of a recreation to have my ears
2596: teased with measured noises,” said Mr. Casaubon. “A tune much iterated
2597: has the ridiculous effect of making the words in my mind perform a sort
2598: of minuet to keep time—an effect hardly tolerable, I imagine, after
2599: boyhood. As to the grander forms of music, worthy to accompany solemn
2600: celebrations, and even to serve as an educating influence according to
2601: the ancient conception, I say nothing, for with these we are not
2602: immediately concerned.”
2603: 
2604: “No; but music of that sort I should enjoy,” said Dorothea. “When we
2605: were coming home from Lausanne my uncle took us to hear the great organ
2606: at Freiberg, and it made me sob.”
2607: 
2608: “That kind of thing is not healthy, my dear,” said Mr. Brooke.
2609: “Casaubon, she will be in your hands now: you must teach my niece to
2610: take things more quietly, eh, Dorothea?”
2611: 
2612: He ended with a smile, not wishing to hurt his niece, but really
2613: thinking that it was perhaps better for her to be early married to so
2614: sober a fellow as Casaubon, since she would not hear of Chettam.
2615: 
2616: “It is wonderful, though,” he said to himself as he shuffled out of the
2617: room—“it is wonderful that she should have liked him. However, the
2618: match is good. I should have been travelling out of my brief to have
2619: hindered it, let Mrs. Cadwallader say what she will. He is pretty
2620: certain to be a bishop, is Casaubon. That was a very seasonable
2621: pamphlet of his on the Catholic Question:—a deanery at least. They owe
2622: him a deanery.”
2623: 
2624: And here I must vindicate a claim to philosophical reflectiveness, by
2625: remarking that Mr. Brooke on this occasion little thought of the
2626: Radical speech which, at a later period, he was led to make on the
2627: incomes of the bishops. What elegant historian would neglect a striking
2628: opportunity for pointing out that his heroes did not foresee the
2629: history of the world, or even their own actions?—For example, that
2630: Henry of Navarre, when a Protestant baby, little thought of being a
2631: Catholic monarch; or that Alfred the Great, when he measured his
2632: laborious nights with burning candles, had no idea of future gentlemen
2633: measuring their idle days with watches. Here is a mine of truth, which,
2634: however vigorously it may be worked, is likely to outlast our coal.
2635: 
2636: But of Mr. Brooke I make a further remark perhaps less warranted by
2637: precedent—namely, that if he had foreknown his speech, it might not
2638: have made any great difference. To think with pleasure of his niece’s
2639: husband having a large ecclesiastical income was one thing—to make a
2640: Liberal speech was another thing; and it is a narrow mind which cannot
2641: look at a subject from various points of view.
2642: 
2643: 
2644: 
2645: 
2646: CHAPTER VIII.
2647: 
2648: “Oh, rescue her! I am her brother now,
2649: And you her father. Every gentle maid
2650: Should have a guardian in each gentleman.”
2651: 
2652: 
2653: It was wonderful to Sir James Chettam how well he continued to like
2654: going to the Grange after he had once encountered the difficulty of
2655: seeing Dorothea for the first time in the light of a woman who was
2656: engaged to another man. Of course the forked lightning seemed to pass
2657: through him when he first approached her, and he remained conscious
2658: throughout the interview of hiding uneasiness; but, good as he was, it
2659: must be owned that his uneasiness was less than it would have been if
2660: he had thought his rival a brilliant and desirable match. He had no
2661: sense of being eclipsed by Mr. Casaubon; he was only shocked that
2662: Dorothea was under a melancholy illusion, and his mortification lost
2663: some of its bitterness by being mingled with compassion.
2664: 
2665: Nevertheless, while Sir James said to himself that he had completely
2666: resigned her, since with the perversity of a Desdemona she had not
2667: affected a proposed match that was clearly suitable and according to
2668: nature; he could not yet be quite passive under the idea of her
2669: engagement to Mr. Casaubon. On the day when he first saw them together
2670: in the light of his present knowledge, it seemed to him that he had not
2671: taken the affair seriously enough. Brooke was really culpable; he ought
2672: to have hindered it. Who could speak to him? Something might be done
2673: perhaps even now, at least to defer the marriage. On his way home he
2674: turned into the Rectory and asked for Mr. Cadwallader. Happily, the
2675: Rector was at home, and his visitor was shown into the study, where all
2676: the fishing tackle hung. But he himself was in a little room adjoining,
2677: at work with his turning apparatus, and he called to the baronet to
2678: join him there. The two were better friends than any other landholder
2679: and clergyman in the county—a significant fact which was in agreement
2680: with the amiable expression of their faces.
2681: 
2682: Mr. Cadwallader was a large man, with full lips and a sweet smile; very
2683: plain and rough in his exterior, but with that solid imperturbable ease
2684: and good-humor which is infectious, and like great grassy hills in the
2685: sunshine, quiets even an irritated egoism, and makes it rather ashamed
2686: of itself. “Well, how are you?” he said, showing a hand not quite fit
2687: to be grasped. “Sorry I missed you before. Is there anything
2688: particular? You look vexed.”
2689: 
2690: Sir James’s brow had a little crease in it, a little depression of the
2691: eyebrow, which he seemed purposely to exaggerate as he answered.
2692: 
2693: “It is only this conduct of Brooke’s. I really think somebody should
2694: speak to him.”
2695: 
2696: “What? meaning to stand?” said Mr. Cadwallader, going on with the
2697: arrangement of the reels which he had just been turning. “I hardly
2698: think he means it. But where’s the harm, if he likes it? Any one who
2699: objects to Whiggery should be glad when the Whigs don’t put up the
2700: strongest fellow. They won’t overturn the Constitution with our friend
2701: Brooke’s head for a battering ram.”
2702: 
2703: “Oh, I don’t mean that,” said Sir James, who, after putting down his
2704: hat and throwing himself into a chair, had begun to nurse his leg and
2705: examine the sole of his boot with much bitterness. “I mean this
2706: marriage. I mean his letting that blooming young girl marry Casaubon.”
2707: 
2708: “What is the matter with Casaubon? I see no harm in him—if the girl
2709: likes him.”
2710: 
2711: “She is too young to know what she likes. Her guardian ought to
2712: interfere. He ought not to allow the thing to be done in this headlong
2713: manner. I wonder a man like you, Cadwallader—a man with daughters, can
2714: look at the affair with indifference: and with such a heart as yours!
2715: Do think seriously about it.”
2716: 
2717: “I am not joking; I am as serious as possible,” said the Rector, with a
2718: provoking little inward laugh. “You are as bad as Elinor. She has been
2719: wanting me to go and lecture Brooke; and I have reminded her that her
2720: friends had a very poor opinion of the match she made when she married
2721: me.”
2722: 
2723: “But look at Casaubon,” said Sir James, indignantly. “He must be fifty,
2724: and I don’t believe he could ever have been much more than the shadow
2725: of a man. Look at his legs!”
2726: 
2727: “Confound you handsome young fellows! you think of having it all your
2728: own way in the world. You don’t understand women. They don’t admire you
2729: half so much as you admire yourselves. Elinor used to tell her sisters
2730: that she married me for my ugliness—it was so various and amusing that
2731: it had quite conquered her prudence.”
2732: 
2733: “You! it was easy enough for a woman to love you. But this is no
2734: question of beauty. I don’t _like_ Casaubon.” This was Sir James’s
2735: strongest way of implying that he thought ill of a man’s character.
2736: 
2737: “Why? what do you know against him?” said the Rector laying down his
2738: reels, and putting his thumbs into his armholes with an air of
2739: attention.
2740: 
2741: Sir James paused. He did not usually find it easy to give his reasons:
2742: it seemed to him strange that people should not know them without being
2743: told, since he only felt what was reasonable. At last he said—
2744: 
2745: “Now, Cadwallader, has he got any heart?”
2746: 
2747: “Well, yes. I don’t mean of the melting sort, but a sound kernel,
2748: _that_ you may be sure of. He is very good to his poor relations:
2749: pensions several of the women, and is educating a young fellow at a
2750: good deal of expense. Casaubon acts up to his sense of justice. His
2751: mother’s sister made a bad match—a Pole, I think—lost herself—at any
2752: rate was disowned by her family. If it had not been for that, Casaubon
2753: would not have had so much money by half. I believe he went himself to
2754: find out his cousins, and see what he could do for them. Every man
2755: would not ring so well as that, if you tried his metal. _You_ would,
2756: Chettam; but not every man.”
2757: 
2758: “I don’t know,” said Sir James, coloring. “I am not so sure of myself.”
2759: He paused a moment, and then added, “That was a right thing for
2760: Casaubon to do. But a man may wish to do what is right, and yet be a
2761: sort of parchment code. A woman may not be happy with him. And I think
2762: when a girl is so young as Miss Brooke is, her friends ought to
2763: interfere a little to hinder her from doing anything foolish. You
2764: laugh, because you fancy I have some feeling on my own account. But
2765: upon my honor, it is not that. I should feel just the same if I were
2766: Miss Brooke’s brother or uncle.”
2767: 
2768: “Well, but what should you do?”
2769: 
2770: “I should say that the marriage must not be decided on until she was of
2771: age. And depend upon it, in that case, it would never come off. I wish
2772: you saw it as I do—I wish you would talk to Brooke about it.”
2773: 
2774: Sir James rose as he was finishing his sentence, for he saw Mrs.
2775: Cadwallader entering from the study. She held by the hand her youngest
2776: girl, about five years old, who immediately ran to papa, and was made
2777: comfortable on his knee.
2778: 
2779: “I hear what you are talking about,” said the wife. “But you will make
2780: no impression on Humphrey. As long as the fish rise to his bait,
2781: everybody is what he ought to be. Bless you, Casaubon has got a
2782: trout-stream, and does not care about fishing in it himself: could
2783: there be a better fellow?”
2784: 
2785: “Well, there is something in that,” said the Rector, with his quiet,
2786: inward laugh. “It is a very good quality in a man to have a
2787: trout-stream.”
2788: 
2789: “But seriously,” said Sir James, whose vexation had not yet spent
2790: itself, “don’t you think the Rector might do some good by speaking?”
2791: 
2792: “Oh, I told you beforehand what he would say,” answered Mrs.
2793: Cadwallader, lifting up her eyebrows. “I have done what I could: I wash
2794: my hands of the marriage.”
2795: 
2796: “In the first place,” said the Rector, looking rather grave, “it would
2797: be nonsensical to expect that I could convince Brooke, and make him act
2798: accordingly. Brooke is a very good fellow, but pulpy; he will run into
2799: any mould, but he won’t keep shape.”
2800: 
2801: “He might keep shape long enough to defer the marriage,” said Sir
2802: James.
2803: 
2804: “But, my dear Chettam, why should I use my influence to Casaubon’s
2805: disadvantage, unless I were much surer than I am that I should be
2806: acting for the advantage of Miss Brooke? I know no harm of Casaubon. I
2807: don’t care about his Xisuthrus and Fee-fo-fum and the rest; but then he
2808: doesn’t care about my fishing-tackle. As to the line he took on the
2809: Catholic Question, that was unexpected; but he has always been civil to
2810: me, and I don’t see why I should spoil his sport. For anything I can
2811: tell, Miss Brooke may be happier with him than she would be with any
2812: other man.”
2813: 
2814: “Humphrey! I have no patience with you. You know you would rather dine
2815: under the hedge than with Casaubon alone. You have nothing to say to
2816: each other.”
2817: 
2818: “What has that to do with Miss Brooke’s marrying him? She does not do
2819: it for my amusement.”
2820: 
2821: “He has got no good red blood in his body,” said Sir James.
2822: 
2823: “No. Somebody put a drop under a magnifying-glass and it was all
2824: semicolons and parentheses,” said Mrs. Cadwallader.
2825: 
2826: “Why does he not bring out his book, instead of marrying,” said Sir
2827: James, with a disgust which he held warranted by the sound feeling of
2828: an English layman.
2829: 
2830: “Oh, he dreams footnotes, and they run away with all his brains. They
2831: say, when he was a little boy, he made an abstract of ‘Hop o’ my
2832: Thumb,’ and he has been making abstracts ever since. Ugh! And that is
2833: the man Humphrey goes on saying that a woman may be happy with.”
2834: 
2835: “Well, he is what Miss Brooke likes,” said the Rector. “I don’t profess
2836: to understand every young lady’s taste.”
2837: 
2838: “But if she were your own daughter?” said Sir James.
2839: 
2840: “That would be a different affair. She is _not_ my daughter, and I
2841: don’t feel called upon to interfere. Casaubon is as good as most of us.
2842: He is a scholarly clergyman, and creditable to the cloth. Some Radical
2843: fellow speechifying at Middlemarch said Casaubon was the learned
2844: straw-chopping incumbent, and Freke was the brick-and-mortar incumbent,
2845: and I was the angling incumbent. And upon my word, I don’t see that one
2846: is worse or better than the other.” The Rector ended with his silent
2847: laugh. He always saw the joke of any satire against himself. His
2848: conscience was large and easy, like the rest of him: it did only what
2849: it could do without any trouble.
2850: 
2851: Clearly, there would be no interference with Miss Brooke’s marriage
2852: through Mr. Cadwallader; and Sir James felt with some sadness that she
2853: was to have perfect liberty of misjudgment. It was a sign of his good
2854: disposition that he did not slacken at all in his intention of carrying
2855: out Dorothea’s design of the cottages. Doubtless this persistence was
2856: the best course for his own dignity: but pride only helps us to be
2857: generous; it never makes us so, any more than vanity makes us witty.
2858: She was now enough aware of Sir James’s position with regard to her, to
2859: appreciate the rectitude of his perseverance in a landlord’s duty, to
2860: which he had at first been urged by a lover’s complaisance, and her
2861: pleasure in it was great enough to count for something even in her
2862: present happiness. Perhaps she gave to Sir James Chettam’s cottages all
2863: the interest she could spare from Mr. Casaubon, or rather from the
2864: symphony of hopeful dreams, admiring trust, and passionate self
2865: devotion which that learned gentleman had set playing in her soul.
2866: Hence it happened that in the good baronet’s succeeding visits, while
2867: he was beginning to pay small attentions to Celia, he found himself
2868: talking with more and more pleasure to Dorothea. She was perfectly
2869: unconstrained and without irritation towards him now, and he was
2870: gradually discovering the delight there is in frank kindness and
2871: companionship between a man and a woman who have no passion to hide or
2872: confess.
2873: 
2874: 
2875: 
2876: 
2877: CHAPTER IX.
2878: 
2879: 1_st Gent_. An ancient land in ancient oracles
2880:     Is called “law-thirsty”: all the struggle there
2881:     Was after order and a perfect rule.
2882:     Pray, where lie such lands now? . . .
2883: 
2884: 2_d Gent_. Why, where they lay of old—in human souls.
2885: 
2886: 
2887: Mr. Casaubon’s behavior about settlements was highly satisfactory to
2888: Mr. Brooke, and the preliminaries of marriage rolled smoothly along,
2889: shortening the weeks of courtship. The betrothed bride must see her
2890: future home, and dictate any changes that she would like to have made
2891: there. A woman dictates before marriage in order that she may have an
2892: appetite for submission afterwards. And certainly, the mistakes that we
2893: male and female mortals make when we have our own way might fairly
2894: raise some wonder that we are so fond of it.
2895: 
2896: On a gray but dry November morning Dorothea drove to Lowick in company
2897: with her uncle and Celia. Mr. Casaubon’s home was the manor-house.
2898: Close by, visible from some parts of the garden, was the little church,
2899: with the old parsonage opposite. In the beginning of his career, Mr.
2900: Casaubon had only held the living, but the death of his brother had put
2901: him in possession of the manor also. It had a small park, with a fine
2902: old oak here and there, and an avenue of limes towards the southwest
2903: front, with a sunk fence between park and pleasure-ground, so that from
2904: the drawing-room windows the glance swept uninterruptedly along a slope
2905: of greensward till the limes ended in a level of corn and pastures,
2906: which often seemed to melt into a lake under the setting sun. This was
2907: the happy side of the house, for the south and east looked rather
2908: melancholy even under the brightest morning. The grounds here were more
2909: confined, the flower-beds showed no very careful tendance, and large
2910: clumps of trees, chiefly of sombre yews, had risen high, not ten yards
2911: from the windows. The building, of greenish stone, was in the old
2912: English style, not ugly, but small-windowed and melancholy-looking: the
2913: sort of house that must have children, many flowers, open windows, and
2914: little vistas of bright things, to make it seem a joyous home. In this
2915: latter end of autumn, with a sparse remnant of yellow leaves falling
2916: slowly athwart the dark evergreens in a stillness without sunshine, the
2917: house too had an air of autumnal decline, and Mr. Casaubon, when he
2918: presented himself, had no bloom that could be thrown into relief by
2919: that background.
2920: 
2921: “Oh dear!” Celia said to herself, “I am sure Freshitt Hall would have
2922: been pleasanter than this.” She thought of the white freestone, the
2923: pillared portico, and the terrace full of flowers, Sir James smiling
2924: above them like a prince issuing from his enchantment in a rose-bush,
2925: with a handkerchief swiftly metamorphosed from the most delicately
2926: odorous petals—Sir James, who talked so agreeably, always about things
2927: which had common-sense in them, and not about learning! Celia had those
2928: light young feminine tastes which grave and weatherworn gentlemen
2929: sometimes prefer in a wife; but happily Mr. Casaubon’s bias had been
2930: different, for he would have had no chance with Celia.
2931: 
2932: Dorothea, on the contrary, found the house and grounds all that she
2933: could wish: the dark book-shelves in the long library, the carpets and
2934: curtains with colors subdued by time, the curious old maps and
2935: bird’s-eye views on the walls of the corridor, with here and there an
2936: old vase below, had no oppression for her, and seemed more cheerful
2937: than the casts and pictures at the Grange, which her uncle had long ago
2938: brought home from his travels—they being probably among the ideas he
2939: had taken in at one time. To poor Dorothea these severe classical
2940: nudities and smirking Renaissance-Correggiosities were painfully
2941: inexplicable, staring into the midst of her Puritanic conceptions: she
2942: had never been taught how she could bring them into any sort of
2943: relevance with her life. But the owners of Lowick apparently had not
2944: been travellers, and Mr. Casaubon’s studies of the past were not
2945: carried on by means of such aids.
2946: 
2947: Dorothea walked about the house with delightful emotion. Everything
2948: seemed hallowed to her: this was to be the home of her wifehood, and
2949: she looked up with eyes full of confidence to Mr. Casaubon when he drew
2950: her attention specially to some actual arrangement and asked her if she
2951: would like an alteration. All appeals to her taste she met gratefully,
2952: but saw nothing to alter. His efforts at exact courtesy and formal
2953: tenderness had no defect for her. She filled up all blanks with
2954: unmanifested perfections, interpreting him as she interpreted the works
2955: of Providence, and accounting for seeming discords by her own deafness
2956: to the higher harmonies. And there are many blanks left in the weeks of
2957: courtship which a loving faith fills with happy assurance.
2958: 
2959: “Now, my dear Dorothea, I wish you to favor me by pointing out which
2960: room you would like to have as your boudoir,” said Mr. Casaubon,
2961: showing that his views of the womanly nature were sufficiently large to
2962: include that requirement.
2963: 
2964: “It is very kind of you to think of that,” said Dorothea, “but I assure
2965: you I would rather have all those matters decided for me. I shall be
2966: much happier to take everything as it is—just as you have been used to
2967: have it, or as you will yourself choose it to be. I have no motive for
2968: wishing anything else.”
2969: 
2970: “Oh, Dodo,” said Celia, “will you not have the bow-windowed room
2971: up-stairs?”
2972: 
2973: Mr. Casaubon led the way thither. The bow-window looked down the avenue
2974: of limes; the furniture was all of a faded blue, and there were
2975: miniatures of ladies and gentlemen with powdered hair hanging in a
2976: group. A piece of tapestry over a door also showed a blue-green world
2977: with a pale stag in it. The chairs and tables were thin-legged and easy
2978: to upset. It was a room where one might fancy the ghost of a
2979: tight-laced lady revisiting the scene of her embroidery. A light
2980: bookcase contained duodecimo volumes of polite literature in calf,
2981: completing the furniture.
2982: 
2983: “Yes,” said Mr. Brooke, “this would be a pretty room with some new
2984: hangings, sofas, and that sort of thing. A little bare now.”
2985: 
2986: “No, uncle,” said Dorothea, eagerly. “Pray do not speak of altering
2987: anything. There are so many other things in the world that want
2988: altering—I like to take these things as they are. And you like them as
2989: they are, don’t you?” she added, looking at Mr. Casaubon. “Perhaps this
2990: was your mother’s room when she was young.”
2991: 
2992: “It was,” he said, with his slow bend of the head.
2993: 
2994: “This is your mother,” said Dorothea, who had turned to examine the
2995: group of miniatures. “It is like the tiny one you brought me; only, I
2996: should think, a better portrait. And this one opposite, who is this?”
2997: 
2998: “Her elder sister. They were, like you and your sister, the only two
2999: children of their parents, who hang above them, you see.”
3000: 
3001: “The sister is pretty,” said Celia, implying that she thought less
3002: favorably of Mr. Casaubon’s mother. It was a new opening to Celia’s
3003: imagination, that he came of a family who had all been young in their
3004: time—the ladies wearing necklaces.
3005: 
3006: “It is a peculiar face,” said Dorothea, looking closely. “Those deep
3007: gray eyes rather near together—and the delicate irregular nose with a
3008: sort of ripple in it—and all the powdered curls hanging backward.
3009: Altogether it seems to me peculiar rather than pretty. There is not
3010: even a family likeness between her and your mother.”
3011: 
3012: “No. And they were not alike in their lot.”
3013: 
3014: “You did not mention her to me,” said Dorothea.
3015: 
3016: “My aunt made an unfortunate marriage. I never saw her.”
3017: 
3018: Dorothea wondered a little, but felt that it would be indelicate just
3019: then to ask for any information which Mr. Casaubon did not proffer, and
3020: she turned to the window to admire the view. The sun had lately pierced
3021: the gray, and the avenue of limes cast shadows.
3022: 
3023: “Shall we not walk in the garden now?” said Dorothea.
3024: 
3025: “And you would like to see the church, you know,” said Mr. Brooke. “It
3026: is a droll little church. And the village. It all lies in a nut-shell.
3027: By the way, it will suit you, Dorothea; for the cottages are like a row
3028: of alms-houses—little gardens, gilly-flowers, that sort of thing.”
3029: 
3030: “Yes, please,” said Dorothea, looking at Mr. Casaubon, “I should like
3031: to see all that.” She had got nothing from him more graphic about the
3032: Lowick cottages than that they were “not bad.”
3033: 
3034: They were soon on a gravel walk which led chiefly between grassy
3035: borders and clumps of trees, this being the nearest way to the church,
3036: Mr. Casaubon said. At the little gate leading into the churchyard there
3037: was a pause while Mr. Casaubon went to the parsonage close by to fetch
3038: a key. Celia, who had been hanging a little in the rear, came up
3039: presently, when she saw that Mr. Casaubon was gone away, and said in
3040: her easy staccato, which always seemed to contradict the suspicion of
3041: any malicious intent—
3042: 
3043: “Do you know, Dorothea, I saw some one quite young coming up one of the
3044: walks.”
3045: 
3046: “Is that astonishing, Celia?”
3047: 
3048: “There may be a young gardener, you know—why not?” said Mr. Brooke. “I
3049: told Casaubon he should change his gardener.”
3050: 
3051: “No, not a gardener,” said Celia; “a gentleman with a sketch-book. He
3052: had light-brown curls. I only saw his back. But he was quite young.”
3053: 
3054: “The curate’s son, perhaps,” said Mr. Brooke. “Ah, there is Casaubon
3055: again, and Tucker with him. He is going to introduce Tucker. You don’t
3056: know Tucker yet.”
3057: 
3058: Mr. Tucker was the middle-aged curate, one of the “inferior clergy,”
3059: who are usually not wanting in sons. But after the introduction, the
3060: conversation did not lead to any question about his family, and the
3061: startling apparition of youthfulness was forgotten by every one but
3062: Celia. She inwardly declined to believe that the light-brown curls and
3063: slim figure could have any relationship to Mr. Tucker, who was just as
3064: old and musty-looking as she would have expected Mr. Casaubon’s curate
3065: to be; doubtless an excellent man who would go to heaven (for Celia
3066: wished not to be unprincipled), but the corners of his mouth were so
3067: unpleasant. Celia thought with some dismalness of the time she should
3068: have to spend as bridesmaid at Lowick, while the curate had probably no
3069: pretty little children whom she could like, irrespective of principle.
3070: 
3071: Mr. Tucker was invaluable in their walk; and perhaps Mr. Casaubon had
3072: not been without foresight on this head, the curate being able to
3073: answer all Dorothea’s questions about the villagers and the other
3074: parishioners. Everybody, he assured her, was well off in Lowick: not a
3075: cottager in those double cottages at a low rent but kept a pig, and the
3076: strips of garden at the back were well tended. The small boys wore
3077: excellent corduroy, the girls went out as tidy servants, or did a
3078: little straw-plaiting at home: no looms here, no Dissent; and though
3079: the public disposition was rather towards laying by money than towards
3080: spirituality, there was not much vice. The speckled fowls were so
3081: numerous that Mr. Brooke observed, “Your farmers leave some barley for
3082: the women to glean, I see. The poor folks here might have a fowl in
3083: their pot, as the good French king used to wish for all his people. The
3084: French eat a good many fowls—skinny fowls, you know.”
3085: 
3086: “I think it was a very cheap wish of his,” said Dorothea, indignantly.
3087: “Are kings such monsters that a wish like that must be reckoned a royal
3088: virtue?”
3089: 
3090: “And if he wished them a skinny fowl,” said Celia, “that would not be
3091: nice. But perhaps he wished them to have fat fowls.”
3092: 
3093: “Yes, but the word has dropped out of the text, or perhaps was
3094: subauditum; that is, present in the king’s mind, but not uttered,” said
3095: Mr. Casaubon, smiling and bending his head towards Celia, who
3096: immediately dropped backward a little, because she could not bear Mr.
3097: Casaubon to blink at her.
3098: 
3099: Dorothea sank into silence on the way back to the house. She felt some
3100: disappointment, of which she was yet ashamed, that there was nothing
3101: for her to do in Lowick; and in the next few minutes her mind had
3102: glanced over the possibility, which she would have preferred, of
3103: finding that her home would be in a parish which had a larger share of
3104: the world’s misery, so that she might have had more active duties in
3105: it. Then, recurring to the future actually before her, she made a
3106: picture of more complete devotion to Mr. Casaubon’s aims in which she
3107: would await new duties. Many such might reveal themselves to the higher
3108: knowledge gained by her in that companionship.
3109: 
3110: Mr. Tucker soon left them, having some clerical work which would not
3111: allow him to lunch at the Hall; and as they were re-entering the garden
3112: through the little gate, Mr. Casaubon said—
3113: 
3114: “You seem a little sad, Dorothea. I trust you are pleased with what you
3115: have seen.”
3116: 
3117: “I am feeling something which is perhaps foolish and wrong,” answered
3118: Dorothea, with her usual openness—“almost wishing that the people
3119: wanted more to be done for them here. I have known so few ways of
3120: making my life good for anything. Of course, my notions of usefulness
3121: must be narrow. I must learn new ways of helping people.”
3122: 
3123: “Doubtless,” said Mr. Casaubon. “Each position has its corresponding
3124: duties. Yours, I trust, as the mistress of Lowick, will not leave any
3125: yearning unfulfilled.”
3126: 
3127: “Indeed, I believe that,” said Dorothea, earnestly. “Do not suppose
3128: that I am sad.”
3129: 
3130: “That is well. But, if you are not tired, we will take another way to
3131: the house than that by which we came.”
3132: 
3133: Dorothea was not at all tired, and a little circuit was made towards a
3134: fine yew-tree, the chief hereditary glory of the grounds on this side
3135: of the house. As they approached it, a figure, conspicuous on a dark
3136: background of evergreens, was seated on a bench, sketching the old
3137: tree. Mr. Brooke, who was walking in front with Celia, turned his head,
3138: and said—
3139: 
3140: “Who is that youngster, Casaubon?”
3141: 
3142: They had come very near when Mr. Casaubon answered—
3143: 
3144: “That is a young relative of mine, a second cousin: the grandson, in
3145: fact,” he added, looking at Dorothea, “of the lady whose portrait you
3146: have been noticing, my aunt Julia.”
3147: 
3148: The young man had laid down his sketch-book and risen. His bushy
3149: light-brown curls, as well as his youthfulness, identified him at once
3150: with Celia’s apparition.
3151: 
3152: “Dorothea, let me introduce to you my cousin, Mr. Ladislaw. Will, this
3153: is Miss Brooke.”
3154: 
3155: The cousin was so close now, that, when he lifted his hat, Dorothea
3156: could see a pair of gray eyes rather near together, a delicate
3157: irregular nose with a little ripple in it, and hair falling backward;
3158: but there was a mouth and chin of a more prominent, threatening aspect
3159: than belonged to the type of the grandmother’s miniature. Young
3160: Ladislaw did not feel it necessary to smile, as if he were charmed with
3161: this introduction to his future second cousin and her relatives; but
3162: wore rather a pouting air of discontent.
3163: 
3164: “You are an artist, I see,” said Mr. Brooke, taking up the sketch-book
3165: and turning it over in his unceremonious fashion.
3166: 
3167: “No, I only sketch a little. There is nothing fit to be seen there,”
3168: said young Ladislaw, coloring, perhaps with temper rather than modesty.
3169: 
3170: “Oh, come, this is a nice bit, now. I did a little in this way myself
3171: at one time, you know. Look here, now; this is what I call a nice
3172: thing, done with what we used to call _brio_.” Mr. Brooke held out
3173: towards the two girls a large colored sketch of stony ground and trees,
3174: with a pool.
3175: 
3176: “I am no judge of these things,” said Dorothea, not coldly, but with an
3177: eager deprecation of the appeal to her. “You know, uncle, I never see
3178: the beauty of those pictures which you say are so much praised. They
3179: are a language I do not understand. I suppose there is some relation
3180: between pictures and nature which I am too ignorant to feel—just as you
3181: see what a Greek sentence stands for which means nothing to me.”
3182: Dorothea looked up at Mr. Casaubon, who bowed his head towards her,
3183: while Mr. Brooke said, smiling nonchalantly—
3184: 
3185: “Bless me, now, how different people are! But you had a bad style of
3186: teaching, you know—else this is just the thing for girls—sketching,
3187: fine art and so on. But you took to drawing plans; you don’t understand
3188: _morbidezza_, and that kind of thing. You will come to my house, I
3189: hope, and I will show you what I did in this way,” he continued,
3190: turning to young Ladislaw, who had to be recalled from his
3191: preoccupation in observing Dorothea. Ladislaw had made up his mind that
3192: she must be an unpleasant girl, since she was going to marry Casaubon,
3193: and what she said of her stupidity about pictures would have confirmed
3194: that opinion even if he had believed her. As it was, he took her words
3195: for a covert judgment, and was certain that she thought his sketch
3196: detestable. There was too much cleverness in her apology: she was
3197: laughing both at her uncle and himself. But what a voice! It was like
3198: the voice of a soul that had once lived in an Aeolian harp. This must
3199: be one of Nature’s inconsistencies. There could be no sort of passion
3200: in a girl who would marry Casaubon. But he turned from her, and bowed
3201: his thanks for Mr. Brooke’s invitation.
3202: 
3203: “We will turn over my Italian engravings together,” continued that
3204: good-natured man. “I have no end of those things, that I have laid by
3205: for years. One gets rusty in this part of the country, you know. Not
3206: you, Casaubon; you stick to your studies; but my best ideas get
3207: undermost—out of use, you know. You clever young men must guard against
3208: indolence. I was too indolent, you know: else I might have been
3209: anywhere at one time.”
3210: 
3211: “That is a seasonable admonition,” said Mr. Casaubon; “but now we will
3212: pass on to the house, lest the young ladies should be tired of
3213: standing.”
3214: 
3215: When their backs were turned, young Ladislaw sat down to go on with his
3216: sketching, and as he did so his face broke into an expression of
3217: amusement which increased as he went on drawing, till at last he threw
3218: back his head and laughed aloud. Partly it was the reception of his own
3219: artistic production that tickled him; partly the notion of his grave
3220: cousin as the lover of that girl; and partly Mr. Brooke’s definition of
3221: the place he might have held but for the impediment of indolence. Mr.
3222: Will Ladislaw’s sense of the ludicrous lit up his features very
3223: agreeably: it was the pure enjoyment of comicality, and had no mixture
3224: of sneering and self-exaltation.
3225: 
3226: “What is your nephew going to do with himself, Casaubon?” said Mr.
3227: Brooke, as they went on.
3228: 
3229: “My cousin, you mean—not my nephew.”
3230: 
3231: “Yes, yes, cousin. But in the way of a career, you know.”
3232: 
3233: “The answer to that question is painfully doubtful. On leaving Rugby he
3234: declined to go to an English university, where I would gladly have
3235: placed him, and chose what I must consider the anomalous course of
3236: studying at Heidelberg. And now he wants to go abroad again, without
3237: any special object, save the vague purpose of what he calls culture,
3238: preparation for he knows not what. He declines to choose a profession.”
3239: 
3240: “He has no means but what you furnish, I suppose.”
3241: 
3242: “I have always given him and his friends reason to understand that I
3243: would furnish in moderation what was necessary for providing him with a
3244: scholarly education, and launching him respectably. I am therefore
3245: bound to fulfil the expectation so raised,” said Mr. Casaubon, putting
3246: his conduct in the light of mere rectitude: a trait of delicacy which
3247: Dorothea noticed with admiration.
3248: 
3249: “He has a thirst for travelling; perhaps he may turn out a Bruce or a
3250: Mungo Park,” said Mr. Brooke. “I had a notion of that myself at one
3251: time.”
3252: 
3253: “No, he has no bent towards exploration, or the enlargement of our
3254: geognosis: that would be a special purpose which I could recognize with
3255: some approbation, though without felicitating him on a career which so
3256: often ends in premature and violent death. But so far is he from having
3257: any desire for a more accurate knowledge of the earth’s surface, that
3258: he said he should prefer not to know the sources of the Nile, and that
3259: there should be some unknown regions preserved as hunting grounds for
3260: the poetic imagination.”
3261: 
3262: “Well, there is something in that, you know,” said Mr. Brooke, who had
3263: certainly an impartial mind.
3264: 
3265: “It is, I fear, nothing more than a part of his general inaccuracy and
3266: indisposition to thoroughness of all kinds, which would be a bad augury
3267: for him in any profession, civil or sacred, even were he so far
3268: submissive to ordinary rule as to choose one.”
3269: 
3270: “Perhaps he has conscientious scruples founded on his own unfitness,”
3271: said Dorothea, who was interesting herself in finding a favorable
3272: explanation. “Because the law and medicine should be very serious
3273: professions to undertake, should they not? People’s lives and fortunes
3274: depend on them.”
3275: 
3276: “Doubtless; but I fear that my young relative Will Ladislaw is chiefly
3277: determined in his aversion to these callings by a dislike to steady
3278: application, and to that kind of acquirement which is needful
3279: instrumentally, but is not charming or immediately inviting to
3280: self-indulgent taste. I have insisted to him on what Aristotle has
3281: stated with admirable brevity, that for the achievement of any work
3282: regarded as an end there must be a prior exercise of many energies or
3283: acquired facilities of a secondary order, demanding patience. I have
3284: pointed to my own manuscript volumes, which represent the toil of years
3285: preparatory to a work not yet accomplished. But in vain. To careful
3286: reasoning of this kind he replies by calling himself Pegasus, and every
3287: form of prescribed work ‘harness.’”
3288: 
3289: Celia laughed. She was surprised to find that Mr. Casaubon could say
3290: something quite amusing.
3291: 
3292: “Well, you know, he may turn out a Byron, a Chatterton, a
3293: Churchill—that sort of thing—there’s no telling,” said Mr. Brooke.
3294: “Shall you let him go to Italy, or wherever else he wants to go?”
3295: 
3296: “Yes; I have agreed to furnish him with moderate supplies for a year or
3297: so; he asks no more. I shall let him be tried by the test of freedom.”
3298: 
3299: “That is very kind of you,” said Dorothea, looking up at Mr. Casaubon
3300: with delight. “It is noble. After all, people may really have in them
3301: some vocation which is not quite plain to themselves, may they not?
3302: They may seem idle and weak because they are growing. We should be very
3303: patient with each other, I think.”
3304: 
3305: “I suppose it is being engaged to be married that has made you think
3306: patience good,” said Celia, as soon as she and Dorothea were alone
3307: together, taking off their wrappings.
3308: 
3309: “You mean that I am very impatient, Celia.”
3310: 
3311: “Yes; when people don’t do and say just what you like.” Celia had
3312: become less afraid of “saying things” to Dorothea since this
3313: engagement: cleverness seemed to her more pitiable than ever.
3314: 
3315: 
3316: 
3317: 
3318: CHAPTER X.
3319: 
3320: “He had catched a great cold, had he had no other clothes to wear than
3321: the skin of a bear not yet killed.”—FULLER.
3322: 
3323: 
3324: Young Ladislaw did not pay that visit to which Mr. Brooke had invited
3325: him, and only six days afterwards Mr. Casaubon mentioned that his young
3326: relative had started for the Continent, seeming by this cold vagueness
3327: to waive inquiry. Indeed, Will had declined to fix on any more precise
3328: destination than the entire area of Europe. Genius, he held, is
3329: necessarily intolerant of fetters: on the one hand it must have the
3330: utmost play for its spontaneity; on the other, it may confidently await
3331: those messages from the universe which summon it to its peculiar work,
3332: only placing itself in an attitude of receptivity towards all sublime
3333: chances. The attitudes of receptivity are various, and Will had
3334: sincerely tried many of them. He was not excessively fond of wine, but
3335: he had several times taken too much, simply as an experiment in that
3336: form of ecstasy; he had fasted till he was faint, and then supped on
3337: lobster; he had made himself ill with doses of opium. Nothing greatly
3338: original had resulted from these measures; and the effects of the opium
3339: had convinced him that there was an entire dissimilarity between his
3340: constitution and De Quincey’s. The superadded circumstance which would
3341: evolve the genius had not yet come; the universe had not yet beckoned.
3342: Even Caesar’s fortune at one time was but a grand presentiment. We know
3343: what a masquerade all development is, and what effective shapes may be
3344: disguised in helpless embryos. In fact, the world is full of hopeful
3345: analogies and handsome dubious eggs called possibilities. Will saw
3346: clearly enough the pitiable instances of long incubation producing no
3347: chick, and but for gratitude would have laughed at Casaubon, whose
3348: plodding application, rows of note-books, and small taper of learned
3349: theory exploring the tossed ruins of the world, seemed to enforce a
3350: moral entirely encouraging to Will’s generous reliance on the
3351: intentions of the universe with regard to himself. He held that
3352: reliance to be a mark of genius; and certainly it is no mark to the
3353: contrary; genius consisting neither in self-conceit nor in humility,
3354: but in a power to make or do, not anything in general, but something in
3355: particular. Let him start for the Continent, then, without our
3356: pronouncing on his future. Among all forms of mistake, prophecy is the
3357: most gratuitous.
3358: 
3359: But at present this caution against a too hasty judgment interests me
3360: more in relation to Mr. Casaubon than to his young cousin. If to
3361: Dorothea Mr. Casaubon had been the mere occasion which had set alight
3362: the fine inflammable material of her youthful illusions, does it follow
3363: that he was fairly represented in the minds of those less impassioned
3364: personages who have hitherto delivered their judgments concerning him?
3365: I protest against any absolute conclusion, any prejudice derived from
3366: Mrs. Cadwallader’s contempt for a neighboring clergyman’s alleged
3367: greatness of soul, or Sir James Chettam’s poor opinion of his rival’s
3368: legs,—from Mr. Brooke’s failure to elicit a companion’s ideas, or from
3369: Celia’s criticism of a middle-aged scholar’s personal appearance. I am
3370: not sure that the greatest man of his age, if ever that solitary
3371: superlative existed, could escape these unfavorable reflections of
3372: himself in various small mirrors; and even Milton, looking for his
3373: portrait in a spoon, must submit to have the facial angle of a bumpkin.
3374: Moreover, if Mr. Casaubon, speaking for himself, has rather a chilling
3375: rhetoric, it is not therefore certain that there is no good work or
3376: fine feeling in him. Did not an immortal physicist and interpreter of
3377: hieroglyphs write detestable verses? Has the theory of the solar system
3378: been advanced by graceful manners and conversational tact? Suppose we
3379: turn from outside estimates of a man, to wonder, with keener interest,
3380: what is the report of his own consciousness about his doings or
3381: capacity: with what hindrances he is carrying on his daily labors; what
3382: fading of hopes, or what deeper fixity of self-delusion the years are
3383: marking off within him; and with what spirit he wrestles against
3384: universal pressure, which will one day be too heavy for him, and bring
3385: his heart to its final pause. Doubtless his lot is important in his own
3386: eyes; and the chief reason that we think he asks too large a place in
3387: our consideration must be our want of room for him, since we refer him
3388: to the Divine regard with perfect confidence; nay, it is even held
3389: sublime for our neighbor to expect the utmost there, however little he
3390: may have got from us. Mr. Casaubon, too, was the centre of his own
3391: world; if he was liable to think that others were providentially made
3392: for him, and especially to consider them in the light of their fitness
3393: for the author of a “Key to all Mythologies,” this trait is not quite
3394: alien to us, and, like the other mendicant hopes of mortals, claims
3395: some of our pity.
3396: 
3397: Certainly this affair of his marriage with Miss Brooke touched him more
3398: nearly than it did any one of the persons who have hitherto shown their
3399: disapproval of it, and in the present stage of things I feel more
3400: tenderly towards his experience of success than towards the
3401: disappointment of the amiable Sir James. For in truth, as the day fixed
3402: for his marriage came nearer, Mr. Casaubon did not find his spirits
3403: rising; nor did the contemplation of that matrimonial garden scene,
3404: where, as all experience showed, the path was to be bordered with
3405: flowers, prove persistently more enchanting to him than the accustomed
3406: vaults where he walked taper in hand. He did not confess to himself,
3407: still less could he have breathed to another, his surprise that though
3408: he had won a lovely and noble-hearted girl he had not won
3409: delight,—which he had also regarded as an object to be found by search.
3410: It is true that he knew all the classical passages implying the
3411: contrary; but knowing classical passages, we find, is a mode of motion,
3412: which explains why they leave so little extra force for their personal
3413: application.
3414: 
3415: Poor Mr. Casaubon had imagined that his long studious bachelorhood had
3416: stored up for him a compound interest of enjoyment, and that large
3417: drafts on his affections would not fail to be honored; for we all of
3418: us, grave or light, get our thoughts entangled in metaphors, and act
3419: fatally on the strength of them. And now he was in danger of being
3420: saddened by the very conviction that his circumstances were unusually
3421: happy: there was nothing external by which he could account for a
3422: certain blankness of sensibility which came over him just when his
3423: expectant gladness should have been most lively, just when he exchanged
3424: the accustomed dulness of his Lowick library for his visits to the
3425: Grange. Here was a weary experience in which he was as utterly
3426: condemned to loneliness as in the despair which sometimes threatened
3427: him while toiling in the morass of authorship without seeming nearer to
3428: the goal. And his was that worst loneliness which would shrink from
3429: sympathy. He could not but wish that Dorothea should think him not less
3430: happy than the world would expect her successful suitor to be; and in
3431: relation to his authorship he leaned on her young trust and veneration,
3432: he liked to draw forth her fresh interest in listening, as a means of
3433: encouragement to himself: in talking to her he presented all his
3434: performance and intention with the reflected confidence of the
3435: pedagogue, and rid himself for the time of that chilling ideal audience
3436: which crowded his laborious uncreative hours with the vaporous pressure
3437: of Tartarean shades.
3438: 
3439: For to Dorothea, after that toy-box history of the world adapted to
3440: young ladies which had made the chief part of her education, Mr.
3441: Casaubon’s talk about his great book was full of new vistas; and this
3442: sense of revelation, this surprise of a nearer introduction to Stoics
3443: and Alexandrians, as people who had ideas not totally unlike her own,
3444: kept in abeyance for the time her usual eagerness for a binding theory
3445: which could bring her own life and doctrine into strict connection with
3446: that amazing past, and give the remotest sources of knowledge some
3447: bearing on her actions. That more complete teaching would come—Mr.
3448: Casaubon would tell her all that: she was looking forward to higher
3449: initiation in ideas, as she was looking forward to marriage, and
3450: blending her dim conceptions of both. It would be a great mistake to
3451: suppose that Dorothea would have cared about any share in Mr.
3452: Casaubon’s learning as mere accomplishment; for though opinion in the
3453: neighborhood of Freshitt and Tipton had pronounced her clever, that
3454: epithet would not have described her to circles in whose more precise
3455: vocabulary cleverness implies mere aptitude for knowing and doing,
3456: apart from character. All her eagerness for acquirement lay within that
3457: full current of sympathetic motive in which her ideas and impulses were
3458: habitually swept along. She did not want to deck herself with
3459: knowledge—to wear it loose from the nerves and blood that fed her
3460: action; and if she had written a book she must have done it as Saint
3461: Theresa did, under the command of an authority that constrained her
3462: conscience. But something she yearned for by which her life might be
3463: filled with action at once rational and ardent; and since the time was
3464: gone by for guiding visions and spiritual directors, since prayer
3465: heightened yearning but not instruction, what lamp was there but
3466: knowledge? Surely learned men kept the only oil; and who more learned
3467: than Mr. Casaubon?
3468: 
3469: Thus in these brief weeks Dorothea’s joyous grateful expectation was
3470: unbroken, and however her lover might occasionally be conscious of
3471: flatness, he could never refer it to any slackening of her affectionate
3472: interest.
3473: 
3474: The season was mild enough to encourage the project of extending the
3475: wedding journey as far as Rome, and Mr. Casaubon was anxious for this
3476: because he wished to inspect some manuscripts in the Vatican.
3477: 
3478: “I still regret that your sister is not to accompany us,” he said one
3479: morning, some time after it had been ascertained that Celia objected to
3480: go, and that Dorothea did not wish for her companionship. “You will
3481: have many lonely hours, Dorothea, for I shall be constrained to make
3482: the utmost use of my time during our stay in Rome, and I should feel
3483: more at liberty if you had a companion.”
3484: 
3485: The words “I should feel more at liberty” grated on Dorothea. For the
3486: first time in speaking to Mr. Casaubon she colored from annoyance.
3487: 
3488: “You must have misunderstood me very much,” she said, “if you think I
3489: should not enter into the value of your time—if you think that I should
3490: not willingly give up whatever interfered with your using it to the
3491: best purpose.”
3492: 
3493: “That is very amiable in you, my dear Dorothea,” said Mr. Casaubon, not
3494: in the least noticing that she was hurt; “but if you had a lady as your
3495: companion, I could put you both under the care of a cicerone, and we
3496: could thus achieve two purposes in the same space of time.”
3497: 
3498: “I beg you will not refer to this again,” said Dorothea, rather
3499: haughtily. But immediately she feared that she was wrong, and turning
3500: towards him she laid her hand on his, adding in a different tone, “Pray
3501: do not be anxious about me. I shall have so much to think of when I am
3502: alone. And Tantripp will be a sufficient companion, just to take care
3503: of me. I could not bear to have Celia: she would be miserable.”
3504: 
3505: It was time to dress. There was to be a dinner-party that day, the last
3506: of the parties which were held at the Grange as proper preliminaries to
3507: the wedding, and Dorothea was glad of a reason for moving away at once
3508: on the sound of the bell, as if she needed more than her usual amount
3509: of preparation. She was ashamed of being irritated from some cause she
3510: could not define even to herself; for though she had no intention to be
3511: untruthful, her reply had not touched the real hurt within her. Mr.
3512: Casaubon’s words had been quite reasonable, yet they had brought a
3513: vague instantaneous sense of aloofness on his part.
3514: 
3515: “Surely I am in a strangely selfish weak state of mind,” she said to
3516: herself. “How can I have a husband who is so much above me without
3517: knowing that he needs me less than I need him?”
3518: 
3519: Having convinced herself that Mr. Casaubon was altogether right, she
3520: recovered her equanimity, and was an agreeable image of serene dignity
3521: when she came into the drawing-room in her silver-gray dress—the simple
3522: lines of her dark-brown hair parted over her brow and coiled massively
3523: behind, in keeping with the entire absence from her manner and
3524: expression of all search after mere effect. Sometimes when Dorothea was
3525: in company, there seemed to be as complete an air of repose about her
3526: as if she had been a picture of Santa Barbara looking out from her
3527: tower into the clear air; but these intervals of quietude made the
3528: energy of her speech and emotion the more remarked when some outward
3529: appeal had touched her.
3530: 
3531: She was naturally the subject of many observations this evening, for
3532: the dinner-party was large and rather more miscellaneous as to the male
3533: portion than any which had been held at the Grange since Mr. Brooke’s
3534: nieces had resided with him, so that the talking was done in duos and
3535: trios more or less inharmonious. There was the newly elected mayor of
3536: Middlemarch, who happened to be a manufacturer; the philanthropic
3537: banker his brother-in-law, who predominated so much in the town that
3538: some called him a Methodist, others a hypocrite, according to the
3539: resources of their vocabulary; and there were various professional men.
3540: In fact, Mrs. Cadwallader said that Brooke was beginning to treat the
3541: Middlemarchers, and that she preferred the farmers at the tithe-dinner,
3542: who drank her health unpretentiously, and were not ashamed of their
3543: grandfathers’ furniture. For in that part of the country, before reform
3544: had done its notable part in developing the political consciousness,
3545: there was a clearer distinction of ranks and a dimmer distinction of
3546: parties; so that Mr. Brooke’s miscellaneous invitations seemed to
3547: belong to that general laxity which came from his inordinate travel and
3548: habit of taking too much in the form of ideas.
3549: 
3550: Already, as Miss Brooke passed out of the dining-room, opportunity was
3551: found for some interjectional “asides.”
3552: 
3553: “A fine woman, Miss Brooke! an uncommonly fine woman, by God!” said Mr.
3554: Standish, the old lawyer, who had been so long concerned with the
3555: landed gentry that he had become landed himself, and used that oath in
3556: a deep-mouthed manner as a sort of armorial bearings, stamping the
3557: speech of a man who held a good position.
3558: 
3559: Mr. Bulstrode, the banker, seemed to be addressed, but that gentleman
3560: disliked coarseness and profanity, and merely bowed. The remark was
3561: taken up by Mr. Chichely, a middle-aged bachelor and coursing
3562: celebrity, who had a complexion something like an Easter egg, a few
3563: hairs carefully arranged, and a carriage implying the consciousness of
3564: a distinguished appearance.
3565: 
3566: “Yes, but not my style of woman: I like a woman who lays herself out a
3567: little more to please us. There should be a little filigree about a
3568: woman—something of the coquette. A man likes a sort of challenge. The
3569: more of a dead set she makes at you the better.”
3570: 
3571: “There’s some truth in that,” said Mr. Standish, disposed to be genial.
3572: “And, by God, it’s usually the way with them. I suppose it answers some
3573: wise ends: Providence made them so, eh, Bulstrode?”
3574: 
3575: “I should be disposed to refer coquetry to another source,” said Mr.
3576: Bulstrode. “I should rather refer it to the devil.”
3577: 
3578: “Ay, to be sure, there should be a little devil in a woman,” said Mr.
3579: Chichely, whose study of the fair sex seemed to have been detrimental
3580: to his theology. “And I like them blond, with a certain gait, and a
3581: swan neck. Between ourselves, the mayor’s daughter is more to my taste
3582: than Miss Brooke or Miss Celia either. If I were a marrying man I
3583: should choose Miss Vincy before either of them.”
3584: 
3585: “Well, make up, make up,” said Mr. Standish, jocosely; “you see the
3586: middle-aged fellows carry the day.”
3587: 
3588: Mr. Chichely shook his head with much meaning: he was not going to
3589: incur the certainty of being accepted by the woman he would choose.
3590: 
3591: The Miss Vincy who had the honor of being Mr. Chichely’s ideal was of
3592: course not present; for Mr. Brooke, always objecting to go too far,
3593: would not have chosen that his nieces should meet the daughter of a
3594: Middlemarch manufacturer, unless it were on a public occasion. The
3595: feminine part of the company included none whom Lady Chettam or Mrs.
3596: Cadwallader could object to; for Mrs. Renfrew, the colonel’s widow, was
3597: not only unexceptionable in point of breeding, but also interesting on
3598: the ground of her complaint, which puzzled the doctors, and seemed
3599: clearly a case wherein the fulness of professional knowledge might need
3600: the supplement of quackery. Lady Chettam, who attributed her own
3601: remarkable health to home-made bitters united with constant medical
3602: attendance, entered with much exercise of the imagination into Mrs.
3603: Renfrew’s account of symptoms, and into the amazing futility in her
3604: case of all strengthening medicines.
3605: 
3606: “Where can all the strength of those medicines go, my dear?” said the
3607: mild but stately dowager, turning to Mrs. Cadwallader reflectively,
3608: when Mrs. Renfrew’s attention was called away.
3609: 
3610: “It strengthens the disease,” said the Rector’s wife, much too
3611: well-born not to be an amateur in medicine. “Everything depends on the
3612: constitution: some people make fat, some blood, and some bile—that’s my
3613: view of the matter; and whatever they take is a sort of grist to the
3614: mill.”
3615: 
3616: “Then she ought to take medicines that would reduce—reduce the disease,
3617: you know, if you are right, my dear. And I think what you say is
3618: reasonable.”
3619: 
3620: “Certainly it is reasonable. You have two sorts of potatoes, fed on the
3621: same soil. One of them grows more and more watery—”
3622: 
3623: “Ah! like this poor Mrs. Renfrew—that is what I think. Dropsy! There is
3624: no swelling yet—it is inward. I should say she ought to take drying
3625: medicines, shouldn’t you?—or a dry hot-air bath. Many things might be
3626: tried, of a drying nature.”
3627: 
3628: “Let her try a certain person’s pamphlets,” said Mrs. Cadwallader in an
3629: undertone, seeing the gentlemen enter. “He does not want drying.”
3630: 
3631: “Who, my dear?” said Lady Chettam, a charming woman, not so quick as to
3632: nullify the pleasure of explanation.
3633: 
3634: “The bridegroom—Casaubon. He has certainly been drying up faster since
3635: the engagement: the flame of passion, I suppose.”
3636: 
3637: “I should think he is far from having a good constitution,” said Lady
3638: Chettam, with a still deeper undertone. “And then his studies—so very
3639: dry, as you say.”
3640: 
3641: “Really, by the side of Sir James, he looks like a death’s head skinned
3642: over for the occasion. Mark my words: in a year from this time that
3643: girl will hate him. She looks up to him as an oracle now, and by-and-by
3644: she will be at the other extreme. All flightiness!”
3645: 
3646: “How very shocking! I fear she is headstrong. But tell me—you know all
3647: about him—is there anything very bad? What is the truth?”
3648: 
3649: “The truth? he is as bad as the wrong physic—nasty to take, and sure to
3650: disagree.”
3651: 
3652: “There could not be anything worse than that,” said Lady Chettam, with
3653: so vivid a conception of the physic that she seemed to have learned
3654: something exact about Mr. Casaubon’s disadvantages. “However, James
3655: will hear nothing against Miss Brooke. He says she is the mirror of
3656: women still.”
3657: 
3658: “That is a generous make-believe of his. Depend upon it, he likes
3659: little Celia better, and she appreciates him. I hope you like my little
3660: Celia?”
3661: 
3662: “Certainly; she is fonder of geraniums, and seems more docile, though
3663: not so fine a figure. But we were talking of physic. Tell me about this
3664: new young surgeon, Mr. Lydgate. I am told he is wonderfully clever: he
3665: certainly looks it—a fine brow indeed.”
3666: 
3667: “He is a gentleman. I heard him talking to Humphrey. He talks well.”
3668: 
3669: “Yes. Mr. Brooke says he is one of the Lydgates of Northumberland,
3670: really well connected. One does not expect it in a practitioner of that
3671: kind. For my own part, I like a medical man more on a footing with the
3672: servants; they are often all the cleverer. I assure you I found poor
3673: Hicks’s judgment unfailing; I never knew him wrong. He was coarse and
3674: butcher-like, but he knew my constitution. It was a loss to me his
3675: going off so suddenly. Dear me, what a very animated conversation Miss
3676: Brooke seems to be having with this Mr. Lydgate!”
3677: 
3678: “She is talking cottages and hospitals with him,” said Mrs.
3679: Cadwallader, whose ears and power of interpretation were quick. “I
3680: believe he is a sort of philanthropist, so Brooke is sure to take him
3681: up.”
3682: 
3683: “James,” said Lady Chettam when her son came near, “bring Mr. Lydgate
3684: and introduce him to me. I want to test him.”
3685: 
3686: The affable dowager declared herself delighted with this opportunity of
3687: making Mr. Lydgate’s acquaintance, having heard of his success in
3688: treating fever on a new plan.
3689: 
3690: Mr. Lydgate had the medical accomplishment of looking perfectly grave
3691: whatever nonsense was talked to him, and his dark steady eyes gave him
3692: impressiveness as a listener. He was as little as possible like the
3693: lamented Hicks, especially in a certain careless refinement about his
3694: toilet and utterance. Yet Lady Chettam gathered much confidence in him.
3695: He confirmed her view of her own constitution as being peculiar, by
3696: admitting that all constitutions might be called peculiar, and he did
3697: not deny that hers might be more peculiar than others. He did not
3698: approve of a too lowering system, including reckless cupping, nor, on
3699: the other hand, of incessant port wine and bark. He said “I think so”
3700: with an air of so much deference accompanying the insight of agreement,
3701: that she formed the most cordial opinion of his talents.
3702: 
3703: “I am quite pleased with your protege,” she said to Mr. Brooke before
3704: going away.
3705: 
3706: “My protege?—dear me!—who is that?” said Mr. Brooke.
3707: 
3708: “This young Lydgate, the new doctor. He seems to me to understand his
3709: profession admirably.”
3710: 
3711: “Oh, Lydgate! he is not my protege, you know; only I knew an uncle of
3712: his who sent me a letter about him. However, I think he is likely to be
3713: first-rate—has studied in Paris, knew Broussais; has ideas, you
3714: know—wants to raise the profession.”
3715: 
3716: “Lydgate has lots of ideas, quite new, about ventilation and diet, that
3717: sort of thing,” resumed Mr. Brooke, after he had handed out Lady
3718: Chettam, and had returned to be civil to a group of Middlemarchers.
3719: 
3720: “Hang it, do you think that is quite sound?—upsetting the old
3721: treatment, which has made Englishmen what they are?” said Mr. Standish.
3722: 
3723: “Medical knowledge is at a low ebb among us,” said Mr. Bulstrode, who
3724: spoke in a subdued tone, and had rather a sickly air. “I, for my part,
3725: hail the advent of Mr. Lydgate. I hope to find good reason for
3726: confiding the new hospital to his management.”
3727: 
3728: “That is all very fine,” replied Mr. Standish, who was not fond of Mr.
3729: Bulstrode; “if you like him to try experiments on your hospital
3730: patients, and kill a few people for charity I have no objection. But I
3731: am not going to hand money out of my purse to have experiments tried on
3732: me. I like treatment that has been tested a little.”
3733: 
3734: “Well, you know, Standish, every dose you take is an experiment-an
3735: experiment, you know,” said Mr. Brooke, nodding towards the lawyer.
3736: 
3737: “Oh, if you talk in that sense!” said Mr. Standish, with as much
3738: disgust at such non-legal quibbling as a man can well betray towards a
3739: valuable client.
3740: 
3741: “I should be glad of any treatment that would cure me without reducing
3742: me to a skeleton, like poor Grainger,” said Mr. Vincy, the mayor, a
3743: florid man, who would have served for a study of flesh in striking
3744: contrast with the Franciscan tints of Mr. Bulstrode. “It’s an
3745: uncommonly dangerous thing to be left without any padding against the
3746: shafts of disease, as somebody said,—and I think it a very good
3747: expression myself.”
3748: 
3749: Mr. Lydgate, of course, was out of hearing. He had quitted the party
3750: early, and would have thought it altogether tedious but for the novelty
3751: of certain introductions, especially the introduction to Miss Brooke,
3752: whose youthful bloom, with her approaching marriage to that faded
3753: scholar, and her interest in matters socially useful, gave her the
3754: piquancy of an unusual combination.
3755: 
3756: “She is a good creature—that fine girl—but a little too earnest,” he
3757: thought. “It is troublesome to talk to such women. They are always
3758: wanting reasons, yet they are too ignorant to understand the merits of
3759: any question, and usually fall back on their moral sense to settle
3760: things after their own taste.”
3761: 
3762: Evidently Miss Brooke was not Mr. Lydgate’s style of woman any more
3763: than Mr. Chichely’s. Considered, indeed, in relation to the latter,
3764: whose mind was matured, she was altogether a mistake, and calculated to
3765: shock his trust in final causes, including the adaptation of fine young
3766: women to purplefaced bachelors. But Lydgate was less ripe, and might
3767: possibly have experience before him which would modify his opinion as
3768: to the most excellent things in woman.
3769: 
3770: Miss Brooke, however, was not again seen by either of these gentlemen
3771: under her maiden name. Not long after that dinner-party she had become
3772: Mrs. Casaubon, and was on her way to Rome.
3773: 
3774: 
3775: 
3776: 
3777: CHAPTER XI.
3778: 
3779: But deeds and language such as men do use,
3780: And persons such as comedy would choose,
3781: When she would show an image of the times,
3782: And sport with human follies, not with crimes.
3783: —BEN JONSON.
3784: 
3785: 
3786: Lydgate, in fact, was already conscious of being fascinated by a woman
3787: strikingly different from Miss Brooke: he did not in the least suppose
3788: that he had lost his balance and fallen in love, but he had said of
3789: that particular woman, “She is grace itself; she is perfectly lovely
3790: and accomplished. That is what a woman ought to be: she ought to
3791: produce the effect of exquisite music.” Plain women he regarded as he
3792: did the other severe facts of life, to be faced with philosophy and
3793: investigated by science. But Rosamond Vincy seemed to have the true
3794: melodic charm; and when a man has seen the woman whom he would have
3795: chosen if he had intended to marry speedily, his remaining a bachelor
3796: will usually depend on her resolution rather than on his. Lydgate
3797: believed that he should not marry for several years: not marry until he
3798: had trodden out a good clear path for himself away from the broad road
3799: which was quite ready made. He had seen Miss Vincy above his horizon
3800: almost as long as it had taken Mr. Casaubon to become engaged and
3801: married: but this learned gentleman was possessed of a fortune; he had
3802: assembled his voluminous notes, and had made that sort of reputation
3803: which precedes performance,—often the larger part of a man’s fame. He
3804: took a wife, as we have seen, to adorn the remaining quadrant of his
3805: course, and be a little moon that would cause hardly a calculable
3806: perturbation. But Lydgate was young, poor, ambitious. He had his
3807: half-century before him instead of behind him, and he had come to
3808: Middlemarch bent on doing many things that were not directly fitted to
3809: make his fortune or even secure him a good income. To a man under such
3810: circumstances, taking a wife is something more than a question of
3811: adornment, however highly he may rate this; and Lydgate was disposed to
3812: give it the first place among wifely functions. To his taste, guided by
3813: a single conversation, here was the point on which Miss Brooke would be
3814: found wanting, notwithstanding her undeniable beauty. She did not look
3815: at things from the proper feminine angle. The society of such women was
3816: about as relaxing as going from your work to teach the second form,
3817: instead of reclining in a paradise with sweet laughs for bird-notes,
3818: and blue eyes for a heaven.
3819: 
3820: Certainly nothing at present could seem much less important to Lydgate
3821: than the turn of Miss Brooke’s mind, or to Miss Brooke than the
3822: qualities of the woman who had attracted this young surgeon. But any
3823: one watching keenly the stealthy convergence of human lots, sees a slow
3824: preparation of effects from one life on another, which tells like a
3825: calculated irony on the indifference or the frozen stare with which we
3826: look at our unintroduced neighbor. Destiny stands by sarcastic with our
3827: dramatis personae folded in her hand.
3828: 
3829: Old provincial society had its share of this subtle movement: had not
3830: only its striking downfalls, its brilliant young professional dandies
3831: who ended by living up an entry with a drab and six children for their
3832: establishment, but also those less marked vicissitudes which are
3833: constantly shifting the boundaries of social intercourse, and begetting
3834: new consciousness of interdependence. Some slipped a little downward,
3835: some got higher footing: people denied aspirates, gained wealth, and
3836: fastidious gentlemen stood for boroughs; some were caught in political
3837: currents, some in ecclesiastical, and perhaps found themselves
3838: surprisingly grouped in consequence; while a few personages or families
3839: that stood with rocky firmness amid all this fluctuation, were slowly
3840: presenting new aspects in spite of solidity, and altering with the
3841: double change of self and beholder. Municipal town and rural parish
3842: gradually made fresh threads of connection—gradually, as the old
3843: stocking gave way to the savings-bank, and the worship of the solar
3844: guinea became extinct; while squires and baronets, and even lords who
3845: had once lived blamelessly afar from the civic mind, gathered the
3846: faultiness of closer acquaintanceship. Settlers, too, came from distant
3847: counties, some with an alarming novelty of skill, others with an
3848: offensive advantage in cunning. In fact, much the same sort of movement
3849: and mixture went on in old England as we find in older Herodotus, who
3850: also, in telling what had been, thought it well to take a woman’s lot
3851: for his starting-point; though Io, as a maiden apparently beguiled by
3852: attractive merchandise, was the reverse of Miss Brooke, and in this
3853: respect perhaps bore more resemblance to Rosamond Vincy, who had
3854: excellent taste in costume, with that nymph-like figure and pure
3855: blindness which give the largest range to choice in the flow and color
3856: of drapery. But these things made only part of her charm. She was
3857: admitted to be the flower of Mrs. Lemon’s school, the chief school in
3858: the county, where the teaching included all that was demanded in the
3859: accomplished female—even to extras, such as the getting in and out of a
3860: carriage. Mrs. Lemon herself had always held up Miss Vincy as an
3861: example: no pupil, she said, exceeded that young lady for mental
3862: acquisition and propriety of speech, while her musical execution was
3863: quite exceptional. We cannot help the way in which people speak of us,
3864: and probably if Mrs. Lemon had undertaken to describe Juliet or Imogen,
3865: these heroines would not have seemed poetical. The first vision of
3866: Rosamond would have been enough with most judges to dispel any
3867: prejudice excited by Mrs. Lemon’s praise.
3868: 
3869: Lydgate could not be long in Middlemarch without having that agreeable
3870: vision, or even without making the acquaintance of the Vincy family;
3871: for though Mr. Peacock, whose practice he had paid something to enter
3872: on, had not been their doctor (Mrs. Vincy not liking the lowering
3873: system adopted by him), he had many patients among their connections
3874: and acquaintances. For who of any consequence in Middlemarch was not
3875: connected or at least acquainted with the Vincys? They were old
3876: manufacturers, and had kept a good house for three generations, in
3877: which there had naturally been much intermarrying with neighbors more
3878: or less decidedly genteel. Mr. Vincy’s sister had made a wealthy match
3879: in accepting Mr. Bulstrode, who, however, as a man not born in the
3880: town, and altogether of dimly known origin, was considered to have done
3881: well in uniting himself with a real Middlemarch family; on the other
3882: hand, Mr. Vincy had descended a little, having taken an innkeeper’s
3883: daughter. But on this side too there was a cheering sense of money; for
3884: Mrs. Vincy’s sister had been second wife to rich old Mr. Featherstone,
3885: and had died childless years ago, so that her nephews and nieces might
3886: be supposed to touch the affections of the widower. And it happened
3887: that Mr. Bulstrode and Mr. Featherstone, two of Peacock’s most
3888: important patients, had, from different causes, given an especially
3889: good reception to his successor, who had raised some partisanship as
3890: well as discussion. Mr. Wrench, medical attendant to the Vincy family,
3891: very early had grounds for thinking lightly of Lydgate’s professional
3892: discretion, and there was no report about him which was not retailed at
3893: the Vincys’, where visitors were frequent. Mr. Vincy was more inclined
3894: to general good-fellowship than to taking sides, but there was no need
3895: for him to be hasty in making any new man acquaintance. Rosamond
3896: silently wished that her father would invite Mr. Lydgate. She was tired
3897: of the faces and figures she had always been used to—the various
3898: irregular profiles and gaits and turns of phrase distinguishing those
3899: Middlemarch young men whom she had known as boys. She had been at
3900: school with girls of higher position, whose brothers, she felt sure, it
3901: would have been possible for her to be more interested in, than in
3902: these inevitable Middlemarch companions. But she would not have chosen
3903: to mention her wish to her father; and he, for his part, was in no
3904: hurry on the subject. An alderman about to be mayor must by-and-by
3905: enlarge his dinner-parties, but at present there were plenty of guests
3906: at his well-spread table.
3907: 
3908: That table often remained covered with the relics of the family
3909: breakfast long after Mr. Vincy had gone with his second son to the
3910: warehouse, and when Miss Morgan was already far on in morning lessons
3911: with the younger girls in the schoolroom. It awaited the family
3912: laggard, who found any sort of inconvenience (to others) less
3913: disagreeable than getting up when he was called. This was the case one
3914: morning of the October in which we have lately seen Mr. Casaubon
3915: visiting the Grange; and though the room was a little overheated with
3916: the fire, which had sent the spaniel panting to a remote corner,
3917: Rosamond, for some reason, continued to sit at her embroidery longer
3918: than usual, now and then giving herself a little shake, and laying her
3919: work on her knee to contemplate it with an air of hesitating weariness.
3920: Her mamma, who had returned from an excursion to the kitchen, sat on
3921: the other side of the small work-table with an air of more entire
3922: placidity, until, the clock again giving notice that it was going to
3923: strike, she looked up from the lace-mending which was occupying her
3924: plump fingers and rang the bell.
3925: 
3926: “Knock at Mr. Fred’s door again, Pritchard, and tell him it has struck
3927: half-past ten.”
3928: 
3929: This was said without any change in the radiant good-humor of Mrs.
3930: Vincy’s face, in which forty-five years had delved neither angles nor
3931: parallels; and pushing back her pink capstrings, she let her work rest
3932: on her lap, while she looked admiringly at her daughter.
3933: 
3934: “Mamma,” said Rosamond, “when Fred comes down I wish you would not let
3935: him have red herrings. I cannot bear the smell of them all over the
3936: house at this hour of the morning.”
3937: 
3938: “Oh, my dear, you are so hard on your brothers! It is the only fault I
3939: have to find with you. You are the sweetest temper in the world, but
3940: you are so tetchy with your brothers.”
3941: 
3942: “Not tetchy, mamma: you never hear me speak in an unladylike way.”
3943: 
3944: “Well, but you want to deny them things.”
3945: 
3946: “Brothers are so unpleasant.”
3947: 
3948: “Oh, my dear, you must allow for young men. Be thankful if they have
3949: good hearts. A woman must learn to put up with little things. You will
3950: be married some day.”
3951: 
3952: “Not to any one who is like Fred.”
3953: 
3954: “Don’t decry your own brother, my dear. Few young men have less against
3955: them, although he couldn’t take his degree—I’m sure I can’t understand
3956: why, for he seems to me most clever. And you know yourself he was
3957: thought equal to the best society at college. So particular as you are,
3958: my dear, I wonder you are not glad to have such a gentlemanly young man
3959: for a brother. You are always finding fault with Bob because he is not
3960: Fred.”
3961: 
3962: “Oh no, mamma, only because he is Bob.”
3963: 
3964: “Well, my dear, you will not find any Middlemarch young man who has not
3965: something against him.”
3966: 
3967: “But”—here Rosamond’s face broke into a smile which suddenly revealed
3968: two dimples. She herself thought unfavorably of these dimples and
3969: smiled little in general society. “But I shall not marry any
3970: Middlemarch young man.”
3971: 
3972: “So it seems, my love, for you have as good as refused the pick of
3973: them; and if there’s better to be had, I’m sure there’s no girl better
3974: deserves it.”
3975: 
3976: “Excuse me, mamma—I wish you would not say, ‘the pick of them.’”
3977: 
3978: “Why, what else are they?”
3979: 
3980: “I mean, mamma, it is rather a vulgar expression.”
3981: 
3982: “Very likely, my dear; I never was a good speaker. What should I say?”
3983: 
3984: “The best of them.”
3985: 
3986: “Why, that seems just as plain and common. If I had had time to think,
3987: I should have said, ‘the most superior young men.’ But with your
3988: education you must know.”
3989: 
3990: “What must Rosy know, mother?” said Mr. Fred, who had slid in
3991: unobserved through the half-open door while the ladies were bending
3992: over their work, and now going up to the fire stood with his back
3993: towards it, warming the soles of his slippers.
3994: 
3995: “Whether it’s right to say ‘superior young men,’” said Mrs. Vincy,
3996: ringing the bell.
3997: 
3998: “Oh, there are so many superior teas and sugars now. Superior is
3999: getting to be shopkeepers’ slang.”
4000: 
4001: “Are you beginning to dislike slang, then?” said Rosamond, with mild
4002: gravity.
4003: 
4004: “Only the wrong sort. All choice of words is slang. It marks a class.”
4005: 
4006: “There is correct English: that is not slang.”
4007: 
4008: “I beg your pardon: correct English is the slang of prigs who write
4009: history and essays. And the strongest slang of all is the slang of
4010: poets.”
4011: 
4012: “You will say anything, Fred, to gain your point.”
4013: 
4014: “Well, tell me whether it is slang or poetry to call an ox a
4015: _leg-plaiter_.”
4016: 
4017: “Of course you can call it poetry if you like.”
4018: 
4019: “Aha, Miss Rosy, you don’t know Homer from slang. I shall invent a new
4020: game; I shall write bits of slang and poetry on slips, and give them to
4021: you to separate.”
4022: 
4023: “Dear me, how amusing it is to hear young people talk!” said Mrs.
4024: Vincy, with cheerful admiration.
4025: 
4026: “Have you got nothing else for my breakfast, Pritchard?” said Fred, to
4027: the servant who brought in coffee and buttered toast; while he walked
4028: round the table surveying the ham, potted beef, and other cold
4029: remnants, with an air of silent rejection, and polite forbearance from
4030: signs of disgust.
4031: 
4032: “Should you like eggs, sir?”
4033: 
4034: “Eggs, no! Bring me a grilled bone.”
4035: 
4036: “Really, Fred,” said Rosamond, when the servant had left the room, “if
4037: you must have hot things for breakfast, I wish you would come down
4038: earlier. You can get up at six o’clock to go out hunting; I cannot
4039: understand why you find it so difficult to get up on other mornings.”
4040: 
4041: “That is your want of understanding, Rosy. I can get up to go hunting
4042: because I like it.”
4043: 
4044: “What would you think of me if I came down two hours after every one
4045: else and ordered grilled bone?”
4046: 
4047: “I should think you were an uncommonly fast young lady,” said Fred,
4048: eating his toast with the utmost composure.
4049: 
4050: “I cannot see why brothers are to make themselves disagreeable, any
4051: more than sisters.”
4052: 
4053: “I don’t make myself disagreeable; it is you who find me so.
4054: Disagreeable is a word that describes your feelings and not my
4055: actions.”
4056: 
4057: “I think it describes the smell of grilled bone.”
4058: 
4059: “Not at all. It describes a sensation in your little nose associated
4060: with certain finicking notions which are the classics of Mrs. Lemon’s
4061: school. Look at my mother; you don’t see her objecting to everything
4062: except what she does herself. She is my notion of a pleasant woman.”
4063: 
4064: “Bless you both, my dears, and don’t quarrel,” said Mrs. Vincy, with
4065: motherly cordiality. “Come, Fred, tell us all about the new doctor. How
4066: is your uncle pleased with him?”
4067: 
4068: “Pretty well, I think. He asks Lydgate all sorts of questions and then
4069: screws up his face while he hears the answers, as if they were pinching
4070: his toes. That’s his way. Ah, here comes my grilled bone.”
4071: 
4072: “But how came you to stay out so late, my dear? You only said you were
4073: going to your uncle’s.”
4074: 
4075: “Oh, I dined at Plymdale’s. We had whist. Lydgate was there too.”
4076: 
4077: “And what do you think of him? He is very gentlemanly, I suppose. They
4078: say he is of excellent family—his relations quite county people.”
4079: 
4080: “Yes,” said Fred. “There was a Lydgate at John’s who spent no end of
4081: money. I find this man is a second cousin of his. But rich men may have
4082: very poor devils for second cousins.”
4083: 
4084: “It always makes a difference, though, to be of good family,” said
4085: Rosamond, with a tone of decision which showed that she had thought on
4086: this subject. Rosamond felt that she might have been happier if she had
4087: not been the daughter of a Middlemarch manufacturer. She disliked
4088: anything which reminded her that her mother’s father had been an
4089: innkeeper. Certainly any one remembering the fact might think that Mrs.
4090: Vincy had the air of a very handsome good-humored landlady, accustomed
4091: to the most capricious orders of gentlemen.
4092: 
4093: “I thought it was odd his name was Tertius,” said the bright-faced
4094: matron, “but of course it’s a name in the family. But now, tell us
4095: exactly what sort of man he is.”
4096: 
4097: “Oh, tallish, dark, clever—talks well—rather a prig, I think.”
4098: 
4099: “I never can make out what you mean by a prig,” said Rosamond.
4100: 
4101: “A fellow who wants to show that he has opinions.”
4102: 
4103: “Why, my dear, doctors must have opinions,” said Mrs. Vincy. “What are
4104: they there for else?”
4105: 
4106: “Yes, mother, the opinions they are paid for. But a prig is a fellow
4107: who is always making you a present of his opinions.”
4108: 
4109: “I suppose Mary Garth admires Mr. Lydgate,” said Rosamond, not without
4110: a touch of innuendo.
4111: 
4112: “Really, I can’t say.” said Fred, rather glumly, as he left the table,
4113: and taking up a novel which he had brought down with him, threw himself
4114: into an arm-chair. “If you are jealous of her, go oftener to Stone
4115: Court yourself and eclipse her.”
4116: 
4117: “I wish you would not be so vulgar, Fred. If you have finished, pray
4118: ring the bell.”
4119: 
4120: “It is true, though—what your brother says, Rosamond,” Mrs. Vincy
4121: began, when the servant had cleared the table. “It is a thousand pities
4122: you haven’t patience to go and see your uncle more, so proud of you as
4123: he is, and wanted you to live with him. There’s no knowing what he
4124: might have done for you as well as for Fred. God knows, I’m fond of
4125: having you at home with me, but I can part with my children for their
4126: good. And now it stands to reason that your uncle Featherstone will do
4127: something for Mary Garth.”
4128: 
4129: “Mary Garth can bear being at Stone Court, because she likes that
4130: better than being a governess,” said Rosamond, folding up her work. “I
4131: would rather not have anything left to me if I must earn it by enduring
4132: much of my uncle’s cough and his ugly relations.”
4133: 
4134: “He can’t be long for this world, my dear; I wouldn’t hasten his end,
4135: but what with asthma and that inward complaint, let us hope there is
4136: something better for him in another. And I have no ill-will towards
4137: Mary Garth, but there’s justice to be thought of. And Mr.
4138: Featherstone’s first wife brought him no money, as my sister did. Her
4139: nieces and nephews can’t have so much claim as my sister’s. And I must
4140: say I think Mary Garth a dreadful plain girl—more fit for a governess.”
4141: 
4142: “Every one would not agree with you there, mother,” said Fred, who
4143: seemed to be able to read and listen too.
4144: 
4145: “Well, my dear,” said Mrs. Vincy, wheeling skilfully, “if she _had_
4146: some fortune left her,—a man marries his wife’s relations, and the
4147: Garths are so poor, and live in such a small way. But I shall leave you
4148: to your studies, my dear; for I must go and do some shopping.”
4149: 
4150: “Fred’s studies are not very deep,” said Rosamond, rising with her
4151: mamma, “he is only reading a novel.”
4152: 
4153: “Well, well, by-and-by he’ll go to his Latin and things,” said Mrs.
4154: Vincy, soothingly, stroking her son’s head. “There’s a fire in the
4155: smoking-room on purpose. It’s your father’s wish, you know—Fred, my
4156: dear—and I always tell him you will be good, and go to college again to
4157: take your degree.”
4158: 
4159: Fred drew his mother’s hand down to his lips, but said nothing.
4160: 
4161: “I suppose you are not going out riding to-day?” said Rosamond,
4162: lingering a little after her mamma was gone.
4163: 
4164: “No; why?”
4165: 
4166: “Papa says I may have the chestnut to ride now.”
4167: 
4168: “You can go with me to-morrow, if you like. Only I am going to Stone
4169: Court, remember.”
4170: 
4171: “I want to ride so much, it is indifferent to me where we go.” Rosamond
4172: really wished to go to Stone Court, of all other places.
4173: 
4174: “Oh, I say, Rosy,” said Fred, as she was passing out of the room, “if
4175: you are going to the piano, let me come and play some airs with you.”
4176: 
4177: “Pray do not ask me this morning.”
4178: 
4179: “Why not this morning?”
4180: 
4181: “Really, Fred, I wish you would leave off playing the flute. A man
4182: looks very silly playing the flute. And you play so out of tune.”
4183: 
4184: “When next any one makes love to you, Miss Rosamond, I will tell him
4185: how obliging you are.”
4186: 
4187: “Why should you expect me to oblige you by hearing you play the flute,
4188: any more than I should expect you to oblige me by not playing it?”
4189: 
4190: “And why should you expect me to take you out riding?”
4191: 
4192: This question led to an adjustment, for Rosamond had set her mind on
4193: that particular ride.
4194: 
4195: So Fred was gratified with nearly an hour’s practice of “Ar hyd y nos,”
4196: “Ye banks and braes,” and other favorite airs from his “Instructor on
4197: the Flute;” a wheezy performance, into which he threw much ambition and
4198: an irrepressible hopefulness.
4199: 
4200: 
4201: 
4202: 
4203: CHAPTER XII.
4204: 
4205: He had more tow on his distaffe
4206: Than Gerveis knew.
4207: —CHAUCER.
4208: 
4209: 
4210: The ride to Stone Court, which Fred and Rosamond took the next morning,
4211: lay through a pretty bit of midland landscape, almost all meadows and
4212: pastures, with hedgerows still allowed to grow in bushy beauty and to
4213: spread out coral fruit for the birds. Little details gave each field a
4214: particular physiognomy, dear to the eyes that have looked on them from
4215: childhood: the pool in the corner where the grasses were dank and trees
4216: leaned whisperingly; the great oak shadowing a bare place in
4217: mid-pasture; the high bank where the ash-trees grew; the sudden slope
4218: of the old marl-pit making a red background for the burdock; the
4219: huddled roofs and ricks of the homestead without a traceable way of
4220: approach; the gray gate and fences against the depths of the bordering
4221: wood; and the stray hovel, its old, old thatch full of mossy hills and
4222: valleys with wondrous modulations of light and shadow such as we travel
4223: far to see in later life, and see larger, but not more beautiful. These
4224: are the things that make the gamut of joy in landscape to midland-bred
4225: souls—the things they toddled among, or perhaps learned by heart
4226: standing between their father’s knees while he drove leisurely.
4227: 
4228: But the road, even the byroad, was excellent; for Lowick, as we have
4229: seen, was not a parish of muddy lanes and poor tenants; and it was into
4230: Lowick parish that Fred and Rosamond entered after a couple of miles’
4231: riding. Another mile would bring them to Stone Court, and at the end of
4232: the first half, the house was already visible, looking as if it had
4233: been arrested in its growth toward a stone mansion by an unexpected
4234: budding of farm-buildings on its left flank, which had hindered it from
4235: becoming anything more than the substantial dwelling of a gentleman
4236: farmer. It was not the less agreeable an object in the distance for the
4237: cluster of pinnacled corn-ricks which balanced the fine row of walnuts
4238: on the right.
4239: 
4240: Presently it was possible to discern something that might be a gig on
4241: the circular drive before the front door.
4242: 
4243: “Dear me,” said Rosamond, “I hope none of my uncle’s horrible relations
4244: are there.”
4245: 
4246: “They are, though. That is Mrs. Waule’s gig—the last yellow gig left, I
4247: should think. When I see Mrs. Waule in it, I understand how yellow can
4248: have been worn for mourning. That gig seems to me more funereal than a
4249: hearse. But then Mrs. Waule always has black crape on. How does she
4250: manage it, Rosy? Her friends can’t always be dying.”
4251: 
4252: “I don’t know at all. And she is not in the least evangelical,” said
4253: Rosamond, reflectively, as if that religious point of view would have
4254: fully accounted for perpetual crape. “And, not poor,” she added, after
4255: a moment’s pause.
4256: 
4257: “No, by George! They are as rich as Jews, those Waules and
4258: Featherstones; I mean, for people like them, who don’t want to spend
4259: anything. And yet they hang about my uncle like vultures, and are
4260: afraid of a farthing going away from their side of the family. But I
4261: believe he hates them all.”
4262: 
4263: The Mrs. Waule who was so far from being admirable in the eyes of these
4264: distant connections, had happened to say this very morning (not at all
4265: with a defiant air, but in a low, muffled, neutral tone, as of a voice
4266: heard through cotton wool) that she did not wish “to enjoy their good
4267: opinion.” She was seated, as she observed, on her own brother’s hearth,
4268: and had been Jane Featherstone five-and-twenty years before she had
4269: been Jane Waule, which entitled her to speak when her own brother’s
4270: name had been made free with by those who had no right to it.
4271: 
4272: “What are you driving at there?” said Mr. Featherstone, holding his
4273: stick between his knees and settling his wig, while he gave her a
4274: momentary sharp glance, which seemed to react on him like a draught of
4275: cold air and set him coughing.
4276: 
4277: Mrs. Waule had to defer her answer till he was quiet again, till Mary
4278: Garth had supplied him with fresh syrup, and he had begun to rub the
4279: gold knob of his stick, looking bitterly at the fire. It was a bright
4280: fire, but it made no difference to the chill-looking purplish tint of
4281: Mrs. Waule’s face, which was as neutral as her voice; having mere
4282: chinks for eyes, and lips that hardly moved in speaking.
4283: 
4284: “The doctors can’t master that cough, brother. It’s just like what I
4285: have; for I’m your own sister, constitution and everything. But, as I
4286: was saying, it’s a pity Mrs. Vincy’s family can’t be better conducted.”
4287: 
4288: “Tchah! you said nothing o’ the sort. You said somebody had made free
4289: with my name.”
4290: 
4291: “And no more than can be proved, if what everybody says is true. My
4292: brother Solomon tells me it’s the talk up and down in Middlemarch how
4293: unsteady young Vincy is, and has been forever gambling at billiards
4294: since home he came.”
4295: 
4296: “Nonsense! What’s a game at billiards? It’s a good gentlemanly game;
4297: and young Vincy is not a clodhopper. If your son John took to
4298: billiards, now, he’d make a fool of himself.”
4299: 
4300: “Your nephew John never took to billiards or any other game, brother,
4301: and is far from losing hundreds of pounds, which, if what everybody
4302: says is true, must be found somewhere else than out of Mr. Vincy the
4303: father’s pocket. For they say he’s been losing money for years, though
4304: nobody would think so, to see him go coursing and keeping open house as
4305: they do. And I’ve heard say Mr. Bulstrode condemns Mrs. Vincy beyond
4306: anything for her flightiness, and spoiling her children so.”
4307: 
4308: “What’s Bulstrode to me? I don’t bank with him.”
4309: 
4310: “Well, Mrs. Bulstrode is Mr. Vincy’s own sister, and they do say that
4311: Mr. Vincy mostly trades on the Bank money; and you may see yourself,
4312: brother, when a woman past forty has pink strings always flying, and
4313: that light way of laughing at everything, it’s very unbecoming. But
4314: indulging your children is one thing, and finding money to pay their
4315: debts is another. And it’s openly said that young Vincy has raised
4316: money on his expectations. I don’t say what expectations. Miss Garth
4317: hears me, and is welcome to tell again. I know young people hang
4318: together.”
4319: 
4320: “No, thank you, Mrs. Waule,” said Mary Garth. “I dislike hearing
4321: scandal too much to wish to repeat it.”
4322: 
4323: Mr. Featherstone rubbed the knob of his stick and made a brief
4324: convulsive show of laughter, which had much the same genuineness as an
4325: old whist-player’s chuckle over a bad hand. Still looking at the fire,
4326: he said—
4327: 
4328: “And who pretends to say Fred Vincy hasn’t got expectations? Such a
4329: fine, spirited fellow is like enough to have ’em.”
4330: 
4331: There was a slight pause before Mrs. Waule replied, and when she did
4332: so, her voice seemed to be slightly moistened with tears, though her
4333: face was still dry.
4334: 
4335: “Whether or no, brother, it is naturally painful to me and my brother
4336: Solomon to hear your name made free with, and your complaint being such
4337: as may carry you off sudden, and people who are no more Featherstones
4338: than the Merry-Andrew at the fair, openly reckoning on your property
4339: coming to _them_. And me your own sister, and Solomon your own brother!
4340: And if that’s to be it, what has it pleased the Almighty to make
4341: families for?” Here Mrs. Waule’s tears fell, but with moderation.
4342: 
4343: “Come, out with it, Jane!” said Mr. Featherstone, looking at her. “You
4344: mean to say, Fred Vincy has been getting somebody to advance him money
4345: on what he says he knows about my will, eh?”
4346: 
4347: “I never said so, brother” (Mrs. Waule’s voice had again become dry and
4348: unshaken). “It was told me by my brother Solomon last night when he
4349: called coming from market to give me advice about the old wheat, me
4350: being a widow, and my son John only three-and-twenty, though steady
4351: beyond anything. And he had it from most undeniable authority, and not
4352: one, but many.”
4353: 
4354: “Stuff and nonsense! I don’t believe a word of it. It’s all a got-up
4355: story. Go to the window, missy; I thought I heard a horse. See if the
4356: doctor’s coming.”
4357: 
4358: “Not got up by me, brother, nor yet by Solomon, who, whatever else he
4359: may be—and I don’t deny he has oddities—has made his will and parted
4360: his property equal between such kin as he’s friends with; though, for
4361: my part, I think there are times when some should be considered more
4362: than others. But Solomon makes it no secret what he means to do.”
4363: 
4364: “The more fool he!” said Mr. Featherstone, with some difficulty;
4365: breaking into a severe fit of coughing that required Mary Garth to
4366: stand near him, so that she did not find out whose horses they were
4367: which presently paused stamping on the gravel before the door.
4368: 
4369: Before Mr. Featherstone’s cough was quiet, Rosamond entered, bearing up
4370: her riding-habit with much grace. She bowed ceremoniously to Mrs.
4371: Waule, who said stiffly, “How do you do, miss?” smiled and nodded
4372: silently to Mary, and remained standing till the coughing should cease,
4373: and allow her uncle to notice her.
4374: 
4375: “Heyday, miss!” he said at last, “you have a fine color. Where’s Fred?”
4376: 
4377: “Seeing about the horses. He will be in presently.”
4378: 
4379: “Sit down, sit down. Mrs. Waule, you’d better go.”
4380: 
4381: Even those neighbors who had called Peter Featherstone an old fox, had
4382: never accused him of being insincerely polite, and his sister was quite
4383: used to the peculiar absence of ceremony with which he marked his sense
4384: of blood-relationship. Indeed, she herself was accustomed to think that
4385: entire freedom from the necessity of behaving agreeably was included in
4386: the Almighty’s intentions about families. She rose slowly without any
4387: sign of resentment, and said in her usual muffled monotone, “Brother, I
4388: hope the new doctor will be able to do something for you. Solomon says
4389: there’s great talk of his cleverness. I’m sure it’s my wish you should
4390: be spared. And there’s none more ready to nurse you than your own
4391: sister and your own nieces, if you’d only say the word. There’s
4392: Rebecca, and Joanna, and Elizabeth, you know.”
4393: 
4394: “Ay, ay, I remember—you’ll see I’ve remembered ’em all—all dark and
4395: ugly. They’d need have some money, eh? There never was any beauty in
4396: the women of our family; but the Featherstones have always had some
4397: money, and the Waules too. Waule had money too. A warm man was Waule.
4398: Ay, ay; money’s a good egg; and if you’ve got money to leave behind
4399: you, lay it in a warm nest. Good-by, Mrs. Waule.” Here Mr. Featherstone
4400: pulled at both sides of his wig as if he wanted to deafen himself, and
4401: his sister went away ruminating on this oracular speech of his.
4402: Notwithstanding her jealousy of the Vincys and of Mary Garth, there
4403: remained as the nethermost sediment in her mental shallows a persuasion
4404: that her brother Peter Featherstone could never leave his chief
4405: property away from his blood-relations:—else, why had the Almighty
4406: carried off his two wives both childless, after he had gained so much
4407: by manganese and things, turning up when nobody expected it?—and why
4408: was there a Lowick parish church, and the Waules and Powderells all
4409: sitting in the same pew for generations, and the Featherstone pew next
4410: to them, if, the Sunday after her brother Peter’s death, everybody was
4411: to know that the property was gone out of the family? The human mind
4412: has at no period accepted a moral chaos; and so preposterous a result
4413: was not strictly conceivable. But we are frightened at much that is not
4414: strictly conceivable.
4415: 
4416: When Fred came in the old man eyed him with a peculiar twinkle, which
4417: the younger had often had reason to interpret as pride in the
4418: satisfactory details of his appearance.
4419: 
4420: “You two misses go away,” said Mr. Featherstone. “I want to speak to
4421: Fred.”
4422: 
4423: “Come into my room, Rosamond, you will not mind the cold for a little
4424: while,” said Mary. The two girls had not only known each other in
4425: childhood, but had been at the same provincial school together (Mary as
4426: an articled pupil), so that they had many memories in common, and liked
4427: very well to talk in private. Indeed, this _tête-à-tête_ was one of
4428: Rosamond’s objects in coming to Stone Court.
4429: 
4430: Old Featherstone would not begin the dialogue till the door had been
4431: closed. He continued to look at Fred with the same twinkle and with one
4432: of his habitual grimaces, alternately screwing and widening his mouth;
4433: and when he spoke, it was in a low tone, which might be taken for that
4434: of an informer ready to be bought off, rather than for the tone of an
4435: offended senior. He was not a man to feel any strong moral indignation
4436: even on account of trespasses against himself. It was natural that
4437: others should want to get an advantage over him, but then, he was a
4438: little too cunning for them.
4439: 
4440: “So, sir, you’ve been paying ten per cent for money which you’ve
4441: promised to pay off by mortgaging my land when I’m dead and gone, eh?
4442: You put my life at a twelvemonth, say. But I can alter my will yet.”
4443: 
4444: Fred blushed. He had not borrowed money in that way, for excellent
4445: reasons. But he was conscious of having spoken with some confidence
4446: (perhaps with more than he exactly remembered) about his prospect of
4447: getting Featherstone’s land as a future means of paying present debts.
4448: 
4449: “I don’t know what you refer to, sir. I have certainly never borrowed
4450: any money on such an insecurity. Please do explain.”
4451: 
4452: “No, sir, it’s you must explain. I can alter my will yet, let me tell
4453: you. I’m of sound mind—can reckon compound interest in my head, and
4454: remember every fool’s name as well as I could twenty years ago. What
4455: the deuce? I’m under eighty. I say, you must contradict this story.”
4456: 
4457: “I have contradicted it, sir,” Fred answered, with a touch of
4458: impatience, not remembering that his uncle did not verbally
4459: discriminate contradicting from disproving, though no one was further
4460: from confounding the two ideas than old Featherstone, who often
4461: wondered that so many fools took his own assertions for proofs. “But I
4462: contradict it again. The story is a silly lie.”
4463: 
4464: “Nonsense! you must bring dockiments. It comes from authority.”
4465: 
4466: “Name the authority, and make him name the man of whom I borrowed the
4467: money, and then I can disprove the story.”
4468: 
4469: “It’s pretty good authority, I think—a man who knows most of what goes
4470: on in Middlemarch. It’s that fine, religious, charitable uncle o’
4471: yours. Come now!” Here Mr. Featherstone had his peculiar inward shake
4472: which signified merriment.
4473: 
4474: “Mr. Bulstrode?”
4475: 
4476: “Who else, eh?”
4477: 
4478: “Then the story has grown into this lie out of some sermonizing words
4479: he may have let fall about me. Do they pretend that he named the man
4480: who lent me the money?”
4481: 
4482: “If there is such a man, depend upon it Bulstrode knows him. But,
4483: supposing you only tried to get the money lent, and didn’t get
4484: it—Bulstrode ’ud know that too. You bring me a writing from Bulstrode
4485: to say he doesn’t believe you’ve ever promised to pay your debts out o’
4486: my land. Come now!”
4487: 
4488: Mr. Featherstone’s face required its whole scale of grimaces as a
4489: muscular outlet to his silent triumph in the soundness of his
4490: faculties.
4491: 
4492: Fred felt himself to be in a disgusting dilemma.
4493: 
4494: “You must be joking, sir. Mr. Bulstrode, like other men, believes
4495: scores of things that are not true, and he has a prejudice against me.
4496: I could easily get him to write that he knew no facts in proof of the
4497: report you speak of, though it might lead to unpleasantness. But I
4498: could hardly ask him to write down what he believes or does not believe
4499: about me.” Fred paused an instant, and then added, in politic appeal to
4500: his uncle’s vanity, “That is hardly a thing for a gentleman to ask.”
4501: But he was disappointed in the result.
4502: 
4503: “Ay, I know what you mean. You’d sooner offend me than Bulstrode. And
4504: what’s he?—he’s got no land hereabout that ever I heard tell of. A
4505: speckilating fellow! He may come down any day, when the devil leaves
4506: off backing him. And that’s what his religion means: he wants God
4507: A’mighty to come in. That’s nonsense! There’s one thing I made out
4508: pretty clear when I used to go to church—and it’s this: God A’mighty
4509: sticks to the land. He promises land, and He gives land, and He makes
4510: chaps rich with corn and cattle. But you take the other side. You like
4511: Bulstrode and speckilation better than Featherstone and land.”
4512: 
4513: “I beg your pardon, sir,” said Fred, rising, standing with his back to
4514: the fire and beating his boot with his whip. “I like neither Bulstrode
4515: nor speculation.” He spoke rather sulkily, feeling himself stalemated.
4516: 
4517: “Well, well, you can do without me, that’s pretty clear,” said old
4518: Featherstone, secretly disliking the possibility that Fred would show
4519: himself at all independent. “You neither want a bit of land to make a
4520: squire of you instead of a starving parson, nor a lift of a hundred
4521: pound by the way. It’s all one to me. I can make five codicils if I
4522: like, and I shall keep my bank-notes for a nest-egg. It’s all one to
4523: me.”
4524: 
4525: Fred colored again. Featherstone had rarely given him presents of
4526: money, and at this moment it seemed almost harder to part with the
4527: immediate prospect of bank-notes than with the more distant prospect of
4528: the land.
4529: 
4530: “I am not ungrateful, sir. I never meant to show disregard for any kind
4531: intentions you might have towards me. On the contrary.”
4532: 
4533: “Very good. Then prove it. You bring me a letter from Bulstrode saying
4534: he doesn’t believe you’ve been cracking and promising to pay your debts
4535: out o’ my land, and then, if there’s any scrape you’ve got into, we’ll
4536: see if I can’t back you a bit. Come now! That’s a bargain. Here, give
4537: me your arm. I’ll try and walk round the room.”
4538: 
4539: Fred, in spite of his irritation, had kindness enough in him to be a
4540: little sorry for the unloved, unvenerated old man, who with his
4541: dropsical legs looked more than usually pitiable in walking. While
4542: giving his arm, he thought that he should not himself like to be an old
4543: fellow with his constitution breaking up; and he waited
4544: good-temperedly, first before the window to hear the wonted remarks
4545: about the guinea-fowls and the weather-cock, and then before the scanty
4546: book-shelves, of which the chief glories in dark calf were Josephus,
4547: Culpepper, Klopstock’s “Messiah,” and several volumes of the
4548: “Gentleman’s Magazine.”
4549: 
4550: “Read me the names o’ the books. Come now! you’re a college man.”
4551: 
4552: Fred gave him the titles.
4553: 
4554: “What did missy want with more books? What must you be bringing her
4555: more books for?”
4556: 
4557: “They amuse her, sir. She is very fond of reading.”
4558: 
4559: “A little too fond,” said Mr. Featherstone, captiously. “She was for
4560: reading when she sat with me. But I put a stop to that. She’s got the
4561: newspaper to read out loud. That’s enough for one day, I should think.
4562: I can’t abide to see her reading to herself. You mind and not bring her
4563: any more books, do you hear?”
4564: 
4565: “Yes, sir, I hear.” Fred had received this order before, and had
4566: secretly disobeyed it. He intended to disobey it again.
4567: 
4568: “Ring the bell,” said Mr. Featherstone; “I want missy to come down.”
4569: 
4570: Rosamond and Mary had been talking faster than their male friends. They
4571: did not think of sitting down, but stood at the toilet-table near the
4572: window while Rosamond took off her hat, adjusted her veil, and applied
4573: little touches of her finger-tips to her hair—hair of infantine
4574: fairness, neither flaxen nor yellow. Mary Garth seemed all the plainer
4575: standing at an angle between the two nymphs—the one in the glass, and
4576: the one out of it, who looked at each other with eyes of heavenly blue,
4577: deep enough to hold the most exquisite meanings an ingenious beholder
4578: could put into them, and deep enough to hide the meanings of the owner
4579: if these should happen to be less exquisite. Only a few children in
4580: Middlemarch looked blond by the side of Rosamond, and the slim figure
4581: displayed by her riding-habit had delicate undulations. In fact, most
4582: men in Middlemarch, except her brothers, held that Miss Vincy was the
4583: best girl in the world, and some called her an angel. Mary Garth, on
4584: the contrary, had the aspect of an ordinary sinner: she was brown; her
4585: curly dark hair was rough and stubborn; her stature was low; and it
4586: would not be true to declare, in satisfactory antithesis, that she had
4587: all the virtues. Plainness has its peculiar temptations and vices quite
4588: as much as beauty; it is apt either to feign amiability, or, not
4589: feigning it, to show all the repulsiveness of discontent: at any rate,
4590: to be called an ugly thing in contrast with that lovely creature your
4591: companion, is apt to produce some effect beyond a sense of fine
4592: veracity and fitness in the phrase. At the age of two-and-twenty Mary
4593: had certainly not attained that perfect good sense and good principle
4594: which are usually recommended to the less fortunate girl, as if they
4595: were to be obtained in quantities ready mixed, with a flavor of
4596: resignation as required. Her shrewdness had a streak of satiric
4597: bitterness continually renewed and never carried utterly out of sight,
4598: except by a strong current of gratitude towards those who, instead of
4599: telling her that she ought to be contented, did something to make her
4600: so. Advancing womanhood had tempered her plainness, which was of a good
4601: human sort, such as the mothers of our race have very commonly worn in
4602: all latitudes under a more or less becoming headgear. Rembrandt would
4603: have painted her with pleasure, and would have made her broad features
4604: look out of the canvas with intelligent honesty. For honesty,
4605: truth-telling fairness, was Mary’s reigning virtue: she neither tried
4606: to create illusions, nor indulged in them for her own behoof, and when
4607: she was in a good mood she had humor enough in her to laugh at herself.
4608: When she and Rosamond happened both to be reflected in the glass, she
4609: said, laughingly—
4610: 
4611: “What a brown patch I am by the side of you, Rosy! You are the most
4612: unbecoming companion.”
4613: 
4614: “Oh no! No one thinks of your appearance, you are so sensible and
4615: useful, Mary. Beauty is of very little consequence in reality,” said
4616: Rosamond, turning her head towards Mary, but with eyes swerving towards
4617: the new view of her neck in the glass.
4618: 
4619: “You mean _my_ beauty,” said Mary, rather sardonically.
4620: 
4621: Rosamond thought, “Poor Mary, she takes the kindest things ill.” Aloud
4622: she said, “What have you been doing lately?”
4623: 
4624: “I? Oh, minding the house—pouring out syrup—pretending to be amiable
4625: and contented—learning to have a bad opinion of everybody.”
4626: 
4627: “It is a wretched life for you.”
4628: 
4629: “No,” said Mary, curtly, with a little toss of her head. “I think my
4630: life is pleasanter than your Miss Morgan’s.”
4631: 
4632: “Yes; but Miss Morgan is so uninteresting, and not young.”
4633: 
4634: “She is interesting to herself, I suppose; and I am not at all sure
4635: that everything gets easier as one gets older.”
4636: 
4637: “No,” said Rosamond, reflectively; “one wonders what such people do,
4638: without any prospect. To be sure, there is religion as a support. But,”
4639: she added, dimpling, “it is very different with you, Mary. You may have
4640: an offer.”
4641: 
4642: “Has any one told you he means to make me one?”
4643: 
4644: “Of course not. I mean, there is a gentleman who may fall in love with
4645: you, seeing you almost every day.”
4646: 
4647: A certain change in Mary’s face was chiefly determined by the resolve
4648: not to show any change.
4649: 
4650: “Does that always make people fall in love?” she answered, carelessly;
4651: “it seems to me quite as often a reason for detesting each other.”
4652: 
4653: “Not when they are interesting and agreeable. I hear that Mr. Lydgate
4654: is both.”
4655: 
4656: “Oh, Mr. Lydgate!” said Mary, with an unmistakable lapse into
4657: indifference. “You want to know something about him,” she added, not
4658: choosing to indulge Rosamond’s indirectness.
4659: 
4660: “Merely, how you like him.”
4661: 
4662: “There is no question of liking at present. My liking always wants some
4663: little kindness to kindle it. I am not magnanimous enough to like
4664: people who speak to me without seeming to see me.”
4665: 
4666: “Is he so haughty?” said Rosamond, with heightened satisfaction. “You
4667: know that he is of good family?”
4668: 
4669: “No; he did not give that as a reason.”
4670: 
4671: “Mary! you are the oddest girl. But what sort of looking man is he?
4672: Describe him to me.”
4673: 
4674: “How can one describe a man? I can give you an inventory: heavy
4675: eyebrows, dark eyes, a straight nose, thick dark hair, large solid
4676: white hands—and—let me see—oh, an exquisite cambric
4677: pocket-handkerchief. But you will see him. You know this is about the
4678: time of his visits.”
4679: 
4680: Rosamond blushed a little, but said, meditatively, “I rather like a
4681: haughty manner. I cannot endure a rattling young man.”
4682: 
4683: “I did not tell you that Mr. Lydgate was haughty; but _il y en a pour
4684: tous les goûts_, as little Mamselle used to say, and if any girl can
4685: choose the particular sort of conceit she would like, I should think it
4686: is you, Rosy.”
4687: 
4688: “Haughtiness is not conceit; I call Fred conceited.”
4689: 
4690: “I wish no one said any worse of him. He should be more careful. Mrs.
4691: Waule has been telling uncle that Fred is very unsteady.” Mary spoke
4692: from a girlish impulse which got the better of her judgment. There was
4693: a vague uneasiness associated with the word “unsteady” which she hoped
4694: Rosamond might say something to dissipate. But she purposely abstained
4695: from mentioning Mrs. Waule’s more special insinuation.
4696: 
4697: “Oh, Fred is horrid!” said Rosamond. She would not have allowed herself
4698: so unsuitable a word to any one but Mary.
4699: 
4700: “What do you mean by horrid?”
4701: 
4702: “He is so idle, and makes papa so angry, and says he will not take
4703: orders.”
4704: 
4705: “I think Fred is quite right.”
4706: 
4707: “How can you say he is quite right, Mary? I thought you had more sense
4708: of religion.”
4709: 
4710: “He is not fit to be a clergyman.”
4711: 
4712: “But he ought to be fit.”—“Well, then, he is not what he ought to be. I
4713: know some other people who are in the same case.”
4714: 
4715: “But no one approves of them. I should not like to marry a clergyman;
4716: but there must be clergymen.”
4717: 
4718: “It does not follow that Fred must be one.”
4719: 
4720: “But when papa has been at the expense of educating him for it! And
4721: only suppose, if he should have no fortune left him?”
4722: 
4723: “I can suppose that very well,” said Mary, dryly.
4724: 
4725: “Then I wonder you can defend Fred,” said Rosamond, inclined to push
4726: this point.
4727: 
4728: “I don’t defend him,” said Mary, laughing; “I would defend any parish
4729: from having him for a clergyman.”
4730: 
4731: “But of course if he were a clergyman, he must be different.”
4732: 
4733: “Yes, he would be a great hypocrite; and he is not that yet.”
4734: 
4735: “It is of no use saying anything to you, Mary. You always take Fred’s
4736: part.”
4737: 
4738: “Why should I not take his part?” said Mary, lighting up. “He would
4739: take mine. He is the only person who takes the least trouble to oblige
4740: me.”
4741: 
4742: “You make me feel very uncomfortable, Mary,” said Rosamond, with her
4743: gravest mildness; “I would not tell mamma for the world.”
4744: 
4745: “What would you not tell her?” said Mary, angrily.
4746: 
4747: “Pray do not go into a rage, Mary,” said Rosamond, mildly as ever.
4748: 
4749: “If your mamma is afraid that Fred will make me an offer, tell her that
4750: I would not marry him if he asked me. But he is not going to do so,
4751: that I am aware. He certainly never has asked me.”
4752: 
4753: “Mary, you are always so violent.”
4754: 
4755: “And you are always so exasperating.”
4756: 
4757: “I? What can you blame me for?”
4758: 
4759: “Oh, blameless people are always the most exasperating. There is the
4760: bell—I think we must go down.”
4761: 
4762: “I did not mean to quarrel,” said Rosamond, putting on her hat.
4763: 
4764: “Quarrel? Nonsense; we have not quarrelled. If one is not to get into a
4765: rage sometimes, what is the good of being friends?”
4766: 
4767: “Am I to repeat what you have said?”
4768: 
4769: “Just as you please. I never say what I am afraid of having repeated.
4770: But let us go down.”
4771: 
4772: Mr. Lydgate was rather late this morning, but the visitors stayed long
4773: enough to see him; for Mr. Featherstone asked Rosamond to sing to him,
4774: and she herself was so kind as to propose a second favorite song of
4775: his—“Flow on, thou shining river”—after she had sung “Home, sweet home”
4776: (which she detested). This hard-headed old Overreach approved of the
4777: sentimental song, as the suitable garnish for girls, and also as
4778: fundamentally fine, sentiment being the right thing for a song.
4779: 
4780: Mr. Featherstone was still applauding the last performance, and
4781: assuring missy that her voice was as clear as a blackbird’s, when Mr.
4782: Lydgate’s horse passed the window.
4783: 
4784: His dull expectation of the usual disagreeable routine with an aged
4785: patient—who can hardly believe that medicine would not “set him up” if
4786: the doctor were only clever enough—added to his general disbelief in
4787: Middlemarch charms, made a doubly effective background to this vision
4788: of Rosamond, whom old Featherstone made haste ostentatiously to
4789: introduce as his niece, though he had never thought it worth while to
4790: speak of Mary Garth in that light. Nothing escaped Lydgate in
4791: Rosamond’s graceful behavior: how delicately she waived the notice
4792: which the old man’s want of taste had thrust upon her by a quiet
4793: gravity, not showing her dimples on the wrong occasion, but showing
4794: them afterwards in speaking to Mary, to whom she addressed herself with
4795: so much good-natured interest, that Lydgate, after quickly examining
4796: Mary more fully than he had done before, saw an adorable kindness in
4797: Rosamond’s eyes. But Mary from some cause looked rather out of temper.
4798: 
4799: “Miss Rosy has been singing me a song—you’ve nothing to say against
4800: that, eh, doctor?” said Mr. Featherstone. “I like it better than your
4801: physic.”
4802: 
4803: “That has made me forget how the time was going,” said Rosamond, rising
4804: to reach her hat, which she had laid aside before singing, so that her
4805: flower-like head on its white stem was seen in perfection above her
4806: riding-habit. “Fred, we must really go.”
4807: 
4808: “Very good,” said Fred, who had his own reasons for not being in the
4809: best spirits, and wanted to get away.
4810: 
4811: “Miss Vincy is a musician?” said Lydgate, following her with his eyes.
4812: (Every nerve and muscle in Rosamond was adjusted to the consciousness
4813: that she was being looked at. She was by nature an actress of parts
4814: that entered into her _physique:_ she even acted her own character, and
4815: so well, that she did not know it to be precisely her own.)
4816: 
4817: “The best in Middlemarch, I’ll be bound,” said Mr. Featherstone, “let
4818: the next be who she will. Eh, Fred? Speak up for your sister.”
4819: 
4820: “I’m afraid I’m out of court, sir. My evidence would be good for
4821: nothing.”
4822: 
4823: “Middlemarch has not a very high standard, uncle,” said Rosamond, with
4824: a pretty lightness, going towards her whip, which lay at a distance.
4825: 
4826: Lydgate was quick in anticipating her. He reached the whip before she
4827: did, and turned to present it to her. She bowed and looked at him: he
4828: of course was looking at her, and their eyes met with that peculiar
4829: meeting which is never arrived at by effort, but seems like a sudden
4830: divine clearance of haze. I think Lydgate turned a little paler than
4831: usual, but Rosamond blushed deeply and felt a certain astonishment.
4832: After that, she was really anxious to go, and did not know what sort of
4833: stupidity her uncle was talking of when she went to shake hands with
4834: him.
4835: 
4836: Yet this result, which she took to be a mutual impression, called
4837: falling in love, was just what Rosamond had contemplated beforehand.
4838: Ever since that important new arrival in Middlemarch she had woven a
4839: little future, of which something like this scene was the necessary
4840: beginning. Strangers, whether wrecked and clinging to a raft, or duly
4841: escorted and accompanied by portmanteaus, have always had a
4842: circumstantial fascination for the virgin mind, against which native
4843: merit has urged itself in vain. And a stranger was absolutely necessary
4844: to Rosamond’s social romance, which had always turned on a lover and
4845: bridegroom who was not a Middlemarcher, and who had no connections at
4846: all like her own: of late, indeed, the construction seemed to demand
4847: that he should somehow be related to a baronet. Now that she and the
4848: stranger had met, reality proved much more moving than anticipation,
4849: and Rosamond could not doubt that this was the great epoch of her life.
4850: She judged of her own symptoms as those of awakening love, and she held
4851: it still more natural that Mr. Lydgate should have fallen in love at
4852: first sight of her. These things happened so often at balls, and why
4853: not by the morning light, when the complexion showed all the better for
4854: it? Rosamond, though no older than Mary, was rather used to being
4855: fallen in love with; but she, for her part, had remained indifferent
4856: and fastidiously critical towards both fresh sprig and faded bachelor.
4857: And here was Mr. Lydgate suddenly corresponding to her ideal, being
4858: altogether foreign to Middlemarch, carrying a certain air of
4859: distinction congruous with good family, and possessing connections
4860: which offered vistas of that middle-class heaven, rank; a man of
4861: talent, also, whom it would be especially delightful to enslave: in
4862: fact, a man who had touched her nature quite newly, and brought a vivid
4863: interest into her life which was better than any fancied “might-be”
4864: such as she was in the habit of opposing to the actual.
4865: 
4866: Thus, in riding home, both the brother and the sister were preoccupied
4867: and inclined to be silent. Rosamond, whose basis for her structure had
4868: the usual airy slightness, was of remarkably detailed and realistic
4869: imagination when the foundation had been once presupposed; and before
4870: they had ridden a mile she was far on in the costume and introductions
4871: of her wedded life, having determined on her house in Middlemarch, and
4872: foreseen the visits she would pay to her husband’s high-bred relatives
4873: at a distance, whose finished manners she could appropriate as
4874: thoroughly as she had done her school accomplishments, preparing
4875: herself thus for vaguer elevations which might ultimately come. There
4876: was nothing financial, still less sordid, in her previsions: she cared
4877: about what were considered refinements, and not about the money that
4878: was to pay for them.
4879: 
4880: Fred’s mind, on the other hand, was busy with an anxiety which even his
4881: ready hopefulness could not immediately quell. He saw no way of eluding
4882: Featherstone’s stupid demand without incurring consequences which he
4883: liked less even than the task of fulfilling it. His father was already
4884: out of humor with him, and would be still more so if he were the
4885: occasion of any additional coolness between his own family and the
4886: Bulstrodes. Then, he himself hated having to go and speak to his uncle
4887: Bulstrode, and perhaps after drinking wine he had said many foolish
4888: things about Featherstone’s property, and these had been magnified by
4889: report. Fred felt that he made a wretched figure as a fellow who
4890: bragged about expectations from a queer old miser like Featherstone,
4891: and went to beg for certificates at his bidding. But—those
4892: expectations! He really had them, and he saw no agreeable alternative
4893: if he gave them up; besides, he had lately made a debt which galled him
4894: extremely, and old Featherstone had almost bargained to pay it off. The
4895: whole affair was miserably small: his debts were small, even his
4896: expectations were not anything so very magnificent. Fred had known men
4897: to whom he would have been ashamed of confessing the smallness of his
4898: scrapes. Such ruminations naturally produced a streak of misanthropic
4899: bitterness. To be born the son of a Middlemarch manufacturer, and
4900: inevitable heir to nothing in particular, while such men as Mainwaring
4901: and Vyan—certainly life was a poor business, when a spirited young
4902: fellow, with a good appetite for the best of everything, had so poor an
4903: outlook.
4904: 
4905: It had not occurred to Fred that the introduction of Bulstrode’s name
4906: in the matter was a fiction of old Featherstone’s; nor could this have
4907: made any difference to his position. He saw plainly enough that the old
4908: man wanted to exercise his power by tormenting him a little, and also
4909: probably to get some satisfaction out of seeing him on unpleasant terms
4910: with Bulstrode. Fred fancied that he saw to the bottom of his uncle
4911: Featherstone’s soul, though in reality half what he saw there was no
4912: more than the reflex of his own inclinations. The difficult task of
4913: knowing another soul is not for young gentlemen whose consciousness is
4914: chiefly made up of their own wishes.
4915: 
4916: Fred’s main point of debate with himself was, whether he should tell
4917: his father, or try to get through the affair without his father’s
4918: knowledge. It was probably Mrs. Waule who had been talking about him;
4919: and if Mary Garth had repeated Mrs. Waule’s report to Rosamond, it
4920: would be sure to reach his father, who would as surely question him
4921: about it. He said to Rosamond, as they slackened their pace—
4922: 
4923: “Rosy, did Mary tell you that Mrs. Waule had said anything about me?”
4924: 
4925: “Yes, indeed, she did.”
4926: 
4927: “What?”
4928: 
4929: “That you were very unsteady.”
4930: 
4931: “Was that all?”
4932: 
4933: “I should think that was enough, Fred.”
4934: 
4935: “You are sure she said no more?”
4936: 
4937: “Mary mentioned nothing else. But really, Fred, I think you ought to be
4938: ashamed.”
4939: 
4940: “Oh, fudge! Don’t lecture me. What did Mary say about it?”
4941: 
4942: “I am not obliged to tell you. You care so very much what Mary says,
4943: and you are too rude to allow me to speak.”
4944: 
4945: “Of course I care what Mary says. She is the best girl I know.”
4946: 
4947: “I should never have thought she was a girl to fall in love with.”
4948: 
4949: “How do you know what men would fall in love with? Girls never know.”
4950: 
4951: “At least, Fred, let me advise _you_ not to fall in love with her, for
4952: she says she would not marry you if you asked her.”
4953: 
4954: “She might have waited till I did ask her.”
4955: 
4956: “I knew it would nettle you, Fred.”
4957: 
4958: “Not at all. She would not have said so if you had not provoked her.”
4959: Before reaching home, Fred concluded that he would tell the whole
4960: affair as simply as possible to his father, who might perhaps take on
4961: himself the unpleasant business of speaking to Bulstrode.

4966: BOOK II.
4967: OLD AND YOUNG.
4968: 
4969: 
4970: 
4971: 
4972: CHAPTER XIII.
4973: 
4974: 1_st Gent_. How class your man?—as better than the most,
4975:     Or, seeming better, worse beneath that cloak?
4976:     As saint or knave, pilgrim or hypocrite?
4977: 
4978: 2_d Gent_. Nay, tell me how you class your wealth of books
4979:     The drifted relics of all time.
4980:     As well sort them at once by size and livery:
4981:     Vellum, tall copies, and the common calf
4982:     Will hardly cover more diversity
4983:     Than all your labels cunningly devised
4984:     To class your unread authors.
4985: 
4986: 
4987: In consequence of what he had heard from Fred, Mr. Vincy determined to
4988: speak with Mr. Bulstrode in his private room at the Bank at half-past
4989: one, when he was usually free from other callers. But a visitor had
4990: come in at one o’clock, and Mr. Bulstrode had so much to say to him,
4991: that there was little chance of the interview being over in half an
4992: hour. The banker’s speech was fluent, but it was also copious, and he
4993: used up an appreciable amount of time in brief meditative pauses. Do
4994: not imagine his sickly aspect to have been of the yellow, black-haired
4995: sort: he had a pale blond skin, thin gray-besprinkled brown hair,
4996: light-gray eyes, and a large forehead. Loud men called his subdued tone
4997: an undertone, and sometimes implied that it was inconsistent with
4998: openness; though there seems to be no reason why a loud man should not
4999: be given to concealment of anything except his own voice, unless it can
5000: be shown that Holy Writ has placed the seat of candor in the lungs. Mr.
5001: Bulstrode had also a deferential bending attitude in listening, and an
5002: apparently fixed attentiveness in his eyes which made those persons who
5003: thought themselves worth hearing infer that he was seeking the utmost
5004: improvement from their discourse. Others, who expected to make no great
5005: figure, disliked this kind of moral lantern turned on them. If you are
5006: not proud of your cellar, there is no thrill of satisfaction in seeing
5007: your guest hold up his wine-glass to the light and look judicial. Such
5008: joys are reserved for conscious merit. Hence Mr. Bulstrode’s close
5009: attention was not agreeable to the publicans and sinners in
5010: Middlemarch; it was attributed by some to his being a Pharisee, and by
5011: others to his being Evangelical. Less superficial reasoners among them
5012: wished to know who his father and grandfather were, observing that
5013: five-and-twenty years ago nobody had ever heard of a Bulstrode in
5014: Middlemarch. To his present visitor, Lydgate, the scrutinizing look was
5015: a matter of indifference: he simply formed an unfavorable opinion of
5016: the banker’s constitution, and concluded that he had an eager inward
5017: life with little enjoyment of tangible things.
5018: 
5019: “I shall be exceedingly obliged if you will look in on me here
5020: occasionally, Mr. Lydgate,” the banker observed, after a brief pause.
5021: “If, as I dare to hope, I have the privilege of finding you a valuable
5022: coadjutor in the interesting matter of hospital management, there will
5023: be many questions which we shall need to discuss in private. As to the
5024: new hospital, which is nearly finished, I shall consider what you have
5025: said about the advantages of the special destination for fevers. The
5026: decision will rest with me, for though Lord Medlicote has given the
5027: land and timber for the building, he is not disposed to give his
5028: personal attention to the object.”
5029: 
5030: “There are few things better worth the pains in a provincial town like
5031: this,” said Lydgate. “A fine fever hospital in addition to the old
5032: infirmary might be the nucleus of a medical school here, when once we
5033: get our medical reforms; and what would do more for medical education
5034: than the spread of such schools over the country? A born provincial man
5035: who has a grain of public spirit as well as a few ideas, should do what
5036: he can to resist the rush of everything that is a little better than
5037: common towards London. Any valid professional aims may often find a
5038: freer, if not a richer field, in the provinces.”
5039: 
5040: One of Lydgate’s gifts was a voice habitually deep and sonorous, yet
5041: capable of becoming very low and gentle at the right moment. About his
5042: ordinary bearing there was a certain fling, a fearless expectation of
5043: success, a confidence in his own powers and integrity much fortified by
5044: contempt for petty obstacles or seductions of which he had had no
5045: experience. But this proud openness was made lovable by an expression
5046: of unaffected good-will. Mr. Bulstrode perhaps liked him the better for
5047: the difference between them in pitch and manners; he certainly liked
5048: him the better, as Rosamond did, for being a stranger in Middlemarch.
5049: One can begin so many things with a new person!—even begin to be a
5050: better man.
5051: 
5052: “I shall rejoice to furnish your zeal with fuller opportunities,” Mr.
5053: Bulstrode answered; “I mean, by confiding to you the superintendence of
5054: my new hospital, should a maturer knowledge favor that issue, for I am
5055: determined that so great an object shall not be shackled by our two
5056: physicians. Indeed, I am encouraged to consider your advent to this
5057: town as a gracious indication that a more manifest blessing is now to
5058: be awarded to my efforts, which have hitherto been much withstood. With
5059: regard to the old infirmary, we have gained the initial point—I mean
5060: your election. And now I hope you will not shrink from incurring a
5061: certain amount of jealousy and dislike from your professional brethren
5062: by presenting yourself as a reformer.”
5063: 
5064: “I will not profess bravery,” said Lydgate, smiling, “but I acknowledge
5065: a good deal of pleasure in fighting, and I should not care for my
5066: profession, if I did not believe that better methods were to be found
5067: and enforced there as well as everywhere else.”
5068: 
5069: “The standard of that profession is low in Middlemarch, my dear sir,”
5070: said the banker. “I mean in knowledge and skill; not in social status,
5071: for our medical men are most of them connected with respectable
5072: townspeople here. My own imperfect health has induced me to give some
5073: attention to those palliative resources which the divine mercy has
5074: placed within our reach. I have consulted eminent men in the
5075: metropolis, and I am painfully aware of the backwardness under which
5076: medical treatment labors in our provincial districts.”
5077: 
5078: “Yes;—with our present medical rules and education, one must be
5079: satisfied now and then to meet with a fair practitioner. As to all the
5080: higher questions which determine the starting-point of a diagnosis—as
5081: to the philosophy of medical evidence—any glimmering of these can only
5082: come from a scientific culture of which country practitioners have
5083: usually no more notion than the man in the moon.”
5084: 
5085: Mr. Bulstrode, bending and looking intently, found the form which
5086: Lydgate had given to his agreement not quite suited to his
5087: comprehension. Under such circumstances a judicious man changes the
5088: topic and enters on ground where his own gifts may be more useful.
5089: 
5090: “I am aware,” he said, “that the peculiar bias of medical ability is
5091: towards material means. Nevertheless, Mr. Lydgate, I hope we shall not
5092: vary in sentiment as to a measure in which you are not likely to be
5093: actively concerned, but in which your sympathetic concurrence may be an
5094: aid to me. You recognize, I hope; the existence of spiritual interests
5095: in your patients?”
5096: 
5097: “Certainly I do. But those words are apt to cover different meanings to
5098: different minds.”
5099: 
5100: “Precisely. And on such subjects wrong teaching is as fatal as no
5101: teaching. Now a point which I have much at heart to secure is a new
5102: regulation as to clerical attendance at the old infirmary. The building
5103: stands in Mr. Farebrother’s parish. You know Mr. Farebrother?”
5104: 
5105: “I have seen him. He gave me his vote. I must call to thank him. He
5106: seems a very bright pleasant little fellow. And I understand he is a
5107: naturalist.”
5108: 
5109: “Mr. Farebrother, my dear sir, is a man deeply painful to contemplate.
5110: I suppose there is not a clergyman in this country who has greater
5111: talents.” Mr. Bulstrode paused and looked meditative.
5112: 
5113: “I have not yet been pained by finding any excessive talent in
5114: Middlemarch,” said Lydgate, bluntly.
5115: 
5116: “What I desire,” Mr. Bulstrode continued, looking still more serious,
5117: “is that Mr. Farebrother’s attendance at the hospital should be
5118: superseded by the appointment of a chaplain—of Mr. Tyke, in fact—and
5119: that no other spiritual aid should be called in.”
5120: 
5121: “As a medical man I could have no opinion on such a point unless I knew
5122: Mr. Tyke, and even then I should require to know the cases in which he
5123: was applied.” Lydgate smiled, but he was bent on being circumspect.
5124: 
5125: “Of course you cannot enter fully into the merits of this measure at
5126: present. But”—here Mr. Bulstrode began to speak with a more chiselled
5127: emphasis—“the subject is likely to be referred to the medical board of
5128: the infirmary, and what I trust I may ask of you is, that in virtue of
5129: the cooperation between us which I now look forward to, you will not,
5130: so far as you are concerned, be influenced by my opponents in this
5131: matter.”
5132: 
5133: “I hope I shall have nothing to do with clerical disputes,” said
5134: Lydgate. “The path I have chosen is to work well in my own profession.”
5135: 
5136: “My responsibility, Mr. Lydgate, is of a broader kind. With me, indeed,
5137: this question is one of sacred accountableness; whereas with my
5138: opponents, I have good reason to say that it is an occasion for
5139: gratifying a spirit of worldly opposition. But I shall not therefore
5140: drop one iota of my convictions, or cease to identify myself with that
5141: truth which an evil generation hates. I have devoted myself to this
5142: object of hospital-improvement, but I will boldly confess to you, Mr.
5143: Lydgate, that I should have no interest in hospitals if I believed that
5144: nothing more was concerned therein than the cure of mortal diseases. I
5145: have another ground of action, and in the face of persecution I will
5146: not conceal it.”
5147: 
5148: Mr. Bulstrode’s voice had become a loud and agitated whisper as he said
5149: the last words.
5150: 
5151: “There we certainly differ,” said Lydgate. But he was not sorry that
5152: the door was now opened, and Mr. Vincy was announced. That florid
5153: sociable personage was become more interesting to him since he had seen
5154: Rosamond. Not that, like her, he had been weaving any future in which
5155: their lots were united; but a man naturally remembers a charming girl
5156: with pleasure, and is willing to dine where he may see her again.
5157: Before he took leave, Mr. Vincy had given that invitation which he had
5158: been “in no hurry about,” for Rosamond at breakfast had mentioned that
5159: she thought her uncle Featherstone had taken the new doctor into great
5160: favor.
5161: 
5162: Mr. Bulstrode, alone with his brother-in-law, poured himself out a
5163: glass of water, and opened a sandwich-box.
5164: 
5165: “I cannot persuade you to adopt my regimen, Vincy?”
5166: 
5167: “No, no; I’ve no opinion of that system. Life wants padding,” said Mr.
5168: Vincy, unable to omit his portable theory. “However,” he went on,
5169: accenting the word, as if to dismiss all irrelevance, “what I came here
5170: to talk about was a little affair of my young scapegrace, Fred’s.”
5171: 
5172: “That is a subject on which you and I are likely to take quite as
5173: different views as on diet, Vincy.”
5174: 
5175: “I hope not this time.” (Mr. Vincy was resolved to be good-humored.)
5176: “The fact is, it’s about a whim of old Featherstone’s. Somebody has
5177: been cooking up a story out of spite, and telling it to the old man, to
5178: try to set him against Fred. He’s very fond of Fred, and is likely to
5179: do something handsome for him; indeed he has as good as told Fred that
5180: he means to leave him his land, and that makes other people jealous.”
5181: 
5182: “Vincy, I must repeat, that you will not get any concurrence from me as
5183: to the course you have pursued with your eldest son. It was entirely
5184: from worldly vanity that you destined him for the Church: with a family
5185: of three sons and four daughters, you were not warranted in devoting
5186: money to an expensive education which has succeeded in nothing but in
5187: giving him extravagant idle habits. You are now reaping the
5188: consequences.”
5189: 
5190: To point out other people’s errors was a duty that Mr. Bulstrode rarely
5191: shrank from, but Mr. Vincy was not equally prepared to be patient. When
5192: a man has the immediate prospect of being mayor, and is ready, in the
5193: interests of commerce, to take up a firm attitude on politics
5194: generally, he has naturally a sense of his importance to the framework
5195: of things which seems to throw questions of private conduct into the
5196: background. And this particular reproof irritated him more than any
5197: other. It was eminently superfluous to him to be told that he was
5198: reaping the consequences. But he felt his neck under Bulstrode’s yoke;
5199: and though he usually enjoyed kicking, he was anxious to refrain from
5200: that relief.
5201: 
5202: “As to that, Bulstrode, it’s no use going back. I’m not one of your
5203: pattern men, and I don’t pretend to be. I couldn’t foresee everything
5204: in the trade; there wasn’t a finer business in Middlemarch than ours,
5205: and the lad was clever. My poor brother was in the Church, and would
5206: have done well—had got preferment already, but that stomach fever took
5207: him off: else he might have been a dean by this time. I think I was
5208: justified in what I tried to do for Fred. If you come to religion, it
5209: seems to me a man shouldn’t want to carve out his meat to an ounce
5210: beforehand:—one must trust a little to Providence and be generous. It’s
5211: a good British feeling to try and raise your family a little: in my
5212: opinion, it’s a father’s duty to give his sons a fine chance.”
5213: 
5214: “I don’t wish to act otherwise than as your best friend, Vincy, when I
5215: say that what you have been uttering just now is one mass of
5216: worldliness and inconsistent folly.”
5217: 
5218: “Very well,” said Mr. Vincy, kicking in spite of resolutions, “I never
5219: professed to be anything but worldly; and, what’s more, I don’t see
5220: anybody else who is not worldly. I suppose you don’t conduct business
5221: on what you call unworldly principles. The only difference I see is
5222: that one worldliness is a little bit honester than another.”
5223: 
5224: “This kind of discussion is unfruitful, Vincy,” said Mr. Bulstrode,
5225: who, finishing his sandwich, had thrown himself back in his chair, and
5226: shaded his eyes as if weary. “You had some more particular business.”
5227: 
5228: “Yes, yes. The long and short of it is, somebody has told old
5229: Featherstone, giving you as the authority, that Fred has been borrowing
5230: or trying to borrow money on the prospect of his land. Of course you
5231: never said any such nonsense. But the old fellow will insist on it that
5232: Fred should bring him a denial in your handwriting; that is, just a bit
5233: of a note saying you don’t believe a word of such stuff, either of his
5234: having borrowed or tried to borrow in such a fool’s way. I suppose you
5235: can have no objection to do that.”
5236: 
5237: “Pardon me. I have an objection. I am by no means sure that your son,
5238: in his recklessness and ignorance—I will use no severer word—has not
5239: tried to raise money by holding out his future prospects, or even that
5240: some one may not have been foolish enough to supply him on so vague a
5241: presumption: there is plenty of such lax money-lending as of other
5242: folly in the world.”
5243: 
5244: “But Fred gives me his honor that he has never borrowed money on the
5245: pretence of any understanding about his uncle’s land. He is not a liar.
5246: I don’t want to make him better than he is. I have blown him up
5247: well—nobody can say I wink at what he does. But he is not a liar. And I
5248: should have thought—but I may be wrong—that there was no religion to
5249: hinder a man from believing the best of a young fellow, when you don’t
5250: know worse. It seems to me it would be a poor sort of religion to put a
5251: spoke in his wheel by refusing to say you don’t believe such harm of
5252: him as you’ve got no good reason to believe.”
5253: 
5254: “I am not at all sure that I should be befriending your son by
5255: smoothing his way to the future possession of Featherstone’s property.
5256: I cannot regard wealth as a blessing to those who use it simply as a
5257: harvest for this world. You do not like to hear these things, Vincy,
5258: but on this occasion I feel called upon to tell you that I have no
5259: motive for furthering such a disposition of property as that which you
5260: refer to. I do not shrink from saying that it will not tend to your
5261: son’s eternal welfare or to the glory of God. Why then should you
5262: expect me to pen this kind of affidavit, which has no object but to
5263: keep up a foolish partiality and secure a foolish bequest?”
5264: 
5265: “If you mean to hinder everybody from having money but saints and
5266: evangelists, you must give up some profitable partnerships, that’s all
5267: I can say,” Mr. Vincy burst out very bluntly. “It may be for the glory
5268: of God, but it is not for the glory of the Middlemarch trade, that
5269: Plymdale’s house uses those blue and green dyes it gets from the
5270: Brassing manufactory; they rot the silk, that’s all I know about it.
5271: Perhaps if other people knew so much of the profit went to the glory of
5272: God, they might like it better. But I don’t mind so much about that—I
5273: could get up a pretty row, if I chose.”
5274: 
5275: Mr. Bulstrode paused a little before he answered. “You pain me very
5276: much by speaking in this way, Vincy. I do not expect you to understand
5277: my grounds of action—it is not an easy thing even to thread a path for
5278: principles in the intricacies of the world—still less to make the
5279: thread clear for the careless and the scoffing. You must remember, if
5280: you please, that I stretch my tolerance towards you as my wife’s
5281: brother, and that it little becomes you to complain of me as
5282: withholding material help towards the worldly position of your family.
5283: I must remind you that it is not your own prudence or judgment that has
5284: enabled you to keep your place in the trade.”
5285: 
5286: “Very likely not; but you have been no loser by my trade yet,” said Mr.
5287: Vincy, thoroughly nettled (a result which was seldom much retarded by
5288: previous resolutions). “And when you married Harriet, I don’t see how
5289: you could expect that our families should not hang by the same nail. If
5290: you’ve changed your mind, and want my family to come down in the world,
5291: you’d better say so. I’ve never changed; I’m a plain Churchman now,
5292: just as I used to be before doctrines came up. I take the world as I
5293: find it, in trade and everything else. I’m contented to be no worse
5294: than my neighbors. But if you want us to come down in the world, say
5295: so. I shall know better what to do then.”
5296: 
5297: “You talk unreasonably. Shall you come down in the world for want of
5298: this letter about your son?”
5299: 
5300: “Well, whether or not, I consider it very unhandsome of you to refuse
5301: it. Such doings may be lined with religion, but outside they have a
5302: nasty, dog-in-the-manger look. You might as well slander Fred: it comes
5303: pretty near to it when you refuse to say you didn’t set a slander
5304: going. It’s this sort of thing—this tyrannical spirit, wanting to play
5305: bishop and banker everywhere—it’s this sort of thing makes a man’s name
5306: stink.”
5307: 
5308: “Vincy, if you insist on quarrelling with me, it will be exceedingly
5309: painful to Harriet as well as myself,” said Mr. Bulstrode, with a
5310: trifle more eagerness and paleness than usual.
5311: 
5312: “I don’t want to quarrel. It’s for my interest—and perhaps for yours
5313: too—that we should be friends. I bear you no grudge; I think no worse
5314: of you than I do of other people. A man who half starves himself, and
5315: goes the length in family prayers, and so on, that you do, believes in
5316: his religion whatever it may be: you could turn over your capital just
5317: as fast with cursing and swearing:—plenty of fellows do. You like to be
5318: master, there’s no denying that; you must be first chop in heaven, else
5319: you won’t like it much. But you’re my sister’s husband, and we ought to
5320: stick together; and if I know Harriet, she’ll consider it your fault if
5321: we quarrel because you strain at a gnat in this way, and refuse to do
5322: Fred a good turn. And I don’t mean to say I shall bear it well. I
5323: consider it unhandsome.”
5324: 
5325: Mr. Vincy rose, began to button his great-coat, and looked steadily at
5326: his brother-in-law, meaning to imply a demand for a decisive answer.
5327: 
5328: This was not the first time that Mr. Bulstrode had begun by admonishing
5329: Mr. Vincy, and had ended by seeing a very unsatisfactory reflection of
5330: himself in the coarse unflattering mirror which that manufacturer’s
5331: mind presented to the subtler lights and shadows of his fellow-men; and
5332: perhaps his experience ought to have warned him how the scene would
5333: end. But a full-fed fountain will be generous with its waters even in
5334: the rain, when they are worse than useless; and a fine fount of
5335: admonition is apt to be equally irrepressible.
5336: 
5337: It was not in Mr. Bulstrode’s nature to comply directly in consequence
5338: of uncomfortable suggestions. Before changing his course, he always
5339: needed to shape his motives and bring them into accordance with his
5340: habitual standard. He said, at last—
5341: 
5342: “I will reflect a little, Vincy. I will mention the subject to Harriet.
5343: I shall probably send you a letter.”
5344: 
5345: “Very well. As soon as you can, please. I hope it will all be settled
5346: before I see you to-morrow.”
5347: 
5348: 
5349: 
5350: 
5351: CHAPTER XIV.
5352: 
5353: “Follows here the strict receipt
5354: For that sauce to dainty meat,
5355: Named Idleness, which many eat
5356: By preference, and call it sweet:
5357: _First watch for morsels, like a hound
5358: Mix well with buffets, stir them round
5359: With good thick oil of flatteries, And froth with mean self-lauding
5360: lies.
5361: Serve warm: the vessels you must choose
5362: To keep it in are dead men’s shoes._”
5363: 
5364: 
5365: Mr. Bulstrode’s consultation of Harriet seemed to have had the effect
5366: desired by Mr. Vincy, for early the next morning a letter came which
5367: Fred could carry to Mr. Featherstone as the required testimony.
5368: 
5369: The old gentleman was staying in bed on account of the cold weather,
5370: and as Mary Garth was not to be seen in the sitting-room, Fred went
5371: up-stairs immediately and presented the letter to his uncle, who,
5372: propped up comfortably on a bed-rest, was not less able than usual to
5373: enjoy his consciousness of wisdom in distrusting and frustrating
5374: mankind. He put on his spectacles to read the letter, pursing up his
5375: lips and drawing down their corners.
5376: 
5377: “_Under the circumstances I will not decline to state my
5378: conviction_—tchah! what fine words the fellow puts! He’s as fine as an
5379: auctioneer—_that your son Frederic has not obtained any advance of
5380: money on bequests promised by Mr. Featherstone_—promised? who said I
5381: had ever promised? I promise nothing—I shall make codicils as long as I
5382: like—_and that considering the nature of such a proceeding, it is
5383: unreasonable to presume that a young man of sense and character would
5384: attempt it_—ah, but the gentleman doesn’t say you are a young man of
5385: sense and character, mark you that, sir!—_As to my own concern with any
5386: report of such a nature, I distinctly affirm that I never made any
5387: statement to the effect that your son had borrowed money on any
5388: property that might accrue to him on Mr. Featherstone’s demise_—bless
5389: my heart! ‘property’—accrue—demise! Lawyer Standish is nothing to him.
5390: He couldn’t speak finer if he wanted to borrow. Well,” Mr. Featherstone
5391: here looked over his spectacles at Fred, while he handed back the
5392: letter to him with a contemptuous gesture, “you don’t suppose I believe
5393: a thing because Bulstrode writes it out fine, eh?”
5394: 
5395: Fred colored. “You wished to have the letter, sir. I should think it
5396: very likely that Mr. Bulstrode’s denial is as good as the authority
5397: which told you what he denies.”
5398: 
5399: “Every bit. I never said I believed either one or the other. And now
5400: what d’ you expect?” said Mr. Featherstone, curtly, keeping on his
5401: spectacles, but withdrawing his hands under his wraps.
5402: 
5403: “I expect nothing, sir.” Fred with difficulty restrained himself from
5404: venting his irritation. “I came to bring you the letter. If you like I
5405: will bid you good morning.”
5406: 
5407: “Not yet, not yet. Ring the bell; I want missy to come.”
5408: 
5409: It was a servant who came in answer to the bell.
5410: 
5411: “Tell missy to come!” said Mr. Featherstone, impatiently. “What
5412: business had she to go away?” He spoke in the same tone when Mary came.
5413: 
5414: “Why couldn’t you sit still here till I told you to go? I want my
5415: waistcoat now. I told you always to put it on the bed.”
5416: 
5417: Mary’s eyes looked rather red, as if she had been crying. It was clear
5418: that Mr. Featherstone was in one of his most snappish humors this
5419: morning, and though Fred had now the prospect of receiving the
5420: much-needed present of money, he would have preferred being free to
5421: turn round on the old tyrant and tell him that Mary Garth was too good
5422: to be at his beck. Though Fred had risen as she entered the room, she
5423: had barely noticed him, and looked as if her nerves were quivering with
5424: the expectation that something would be thrown at her. But she never
5425: had anything worse than words to dread. When she went to reach the
5426: waistcoat from a peg, Fred went up to her and said, “Allow me.”
5427: 
5428: “Let it alone! You bring it, missy, and lay it down here,” said Mr.
5429: Featherstone. “Now you go away again till I call you,” he added, when
5430: the waistcoat was laid down by him. It was usual with him to season his
5431: pleasure in showing favor to one person by being especially
5432: disagreeable to another, and Mary was always at hand to furnish the
5433: condiment. When his own relatives came she was treated better. Slowly
5434: he took out a bunch of keys from the waistcoat pocket, and slowly he
5435: drew forth a tin box which was under the bed-clothes.
5436: 
5437: “You expect I am going to give you a little fortune, eh?” he said,
5438: looking above his spectacles and pausing in the act of opening the lid.
5439: 
5440: “Not at all, sir. You were good enough to speak of making me a present
5441: the other day, else, of course, I should not have thought of the
5442: matter.” But Fred was of a hopeful disposition, and a vision had
5443: presented itself of a sum just large enough to deliver him from a
5444: certain anxiety. When Fred got into debt, it always seemed to him
5445: highly probable that something or other—he did not necessarily conceive
5446: what—would come to pass enabling him to pay in due time. And now that
5447: the providential occurrence was apparently close at hand, it would have
5448: been sheer absurdity to think that the supply would be short of the
5449: need: as absurd as a faith that believed in half a miracle for want of
5450: strength to believe in a whole one.
5451: 
5452: The deep-veined hands fingered many bank-notes one after the other,
5453: laying them down flat again, while Fred leaned back in his chair,
5454: scorning to look eager. He held himself to be a gentleman at heart, and
5455: did not like courting an old fellow for his money. At last, Mr.
5456: Featherstone eyed him again over his spectacles and presented him with
5457: a little sheaf of notes: Fred could see distinctly that there were but
5458: five, as the less significant edges gaped towards him. But then, each
5459: might mean fifty pounds. He took them, saying—
5460: 
5461: “I am very much obliged to you, sir,” and was going to roll them up
5462: without seeming to think of their value. But this did not suit Mr.
5463: Featherstone, who was eying him intently.
5464: 
5465: “Come, don’t you think it worth your while to count ’em? You take money
5466: like a lord; I suppose you lose it like one.”
5467: 
5468: “I thought I was not to look a gift-horse in the mouth, sir. But I
5469: shall be very happy to count them.”
5470: 
5471: Fred was not so happy, however, after he had counted them. For they
5472: actually presented the absurdity of being less than his hopefulness had
5473: decided that they must be. What can the fitness of things mean, if not
5474: their fitness to a man’s expectations? Failing this, absurdity and
5475: atheism gape behind him. The collapse for Fred was severe when he found
5476: that he held no more than five twenties, and his share in the higher
5477: education of this country did not seem to help him. Nevertheless he
5478: said, with rapid changes in his fair complexion—
5479: 
5480: “It is very handsome of you, sir.”
5481: 
5482: “I should think it is,” said Mr. Featherstone, locking his box and
5483: replacing it, then taking off his spectacles deliberately, and at
5484: length, as if his inward meditation had more deeply convinced him,
5485: repeating, “I should think it handsome.”
5486: 
5487: “I assure you, sir, I am very grateful,” said Fred, who had had time to
5488: recover his cheerful air.
5489: 
5490: “So you ought to be. You want to cut a figure in the world, and I
5491: reckon Peter Featherstone is the only one you’ve got to trust to.” Here
5492: the old man’s eyes gleamed with a curiously mingled satisfaction in the
5493: consciousness that this smart young fellow relied upon him, and that
5494: the smart young fellow was rather a fool for doing so.
5495: 
5496: “Yes, indeed: I was not born to very splendid chances. Few men have
5497: been more cramped than I have been,” said Fred, with some sense of
5498: surprise at his own virtue, considering how hardly he was dealt with.
5499: “It really seems a little too bad to have to ride a broken-winded
5500: hunter, and see men, who, are not half such good judges as yourself,
5501: able to throw away any amount of money on buying bad bargains.”
5502: 
5503: “Well, you can buy yourself a fine hunter now. Eighty pound is enough
5504: for that, I reckon—and you’ll have twenty pound over to get yourself
5505: out of any little scrape,” said Mr. Featherstone, chuckling slightly.
5506: 
5507: “You are very good, sir,” said Fred, with a fine sense of contrast
5508: between the words and his feeling.
5509: 
5510: “Ay, rather a better uncle than your fine uncle Bulstrode. You won’t
5511: get much out of his spekilations, I think. He’s got a pretty strong
5512: string round your father’s leg, by what I hear, eh?”
5513: 
5514: “My father never tells me anything about his affairs, sir.”
5515: 
5516: “Well, he shows some sense there. But other people find ’em out without
5517: his telling. _He’ll_ never have much to leave you: he’ll most-like die
5518: without a will—he’s the sort of man to do it—let ’em make him mayor of
5519: Middlemarch as much as they like. But you won’t get much by his dying
5520: without a will, though you _are_ the eldest son.”
5521: 
5522: Fred thought that Mr. Featherstone had never been so disagreeable
5523: before. True, he had never before given him quite so much money at
5524: once.
5525: 
5526: “Shall I destroy this letter of Mr. Bulstrode’s, sir?” said Fred,
5527: rising with the letter as if he would put it in the fire.
5528: 
5529: “Ay, ay, I don’t want it. It’s worth no money to me.”
5530: 
5531: Fred carried the letter to the fire, and thrust the poker through it
5532: with much zest. He longed to get out of the room, but he was a little
5533: ashamed before his inner self, as well as before his uncle, to run away
5534: immediately after pocketing the money. Presently, the farm-bailiff came
5535: up to give his master a report, and Fred, to his unspeakable relief,
5536: was dismissed with the injunction to come again soon.
5537: 
5538: He had longed not only to be set free from his uncle, but also to find
5539: Mary Garth. She was now in her usual place by the fire, with sewing in
5540: her hands and a book open on the little table by her side. Her eyelids
5541: had lost some of their redness now, and she had her usual air of
5542: self-command.
5543: 
5544: “Am I wanted up-stairs?” she said, half rising as Fred entered.
5545: 
5546: “No; I am only dismissed, because Simmons is gone up.”
5547: 
5548: Mary sat down again, and resumed her work. She was certainly treating
5549: him with more indifference than usual: she did not know how
5550: affectionately indignant he had felt on her behalf up-stairs.
5551: 
5552: “May I stay here a little, Mary, or shall I bore you?”
5553: 
5554: “Pray sit down,” said Mary; “you will not be so heavy a bore as Mr.
5555: John Waule, who was here yesterday, and he sat down without asking my
5556: leave.”
5557: 
5558: “Poor fellow! I think he is in love with you.”
5559: 
5560: “I am not aware of it. And to me it is one of the most odious things in
5561: a girl’s life, that there must always be some supposition of falling in
5562: love coming between her and any man who is kind to her, and to whom she
5563: is grateful. I should have thought that I, at least, might have been
5564: safe from all that. I have no ground for the nonsensical vanity of
5565: fancying everybody who comes near me is in love with me.”
5566: 
5567: Mary did not mean to betray any feeling, but in spite of herself she
5568: ended in a tremulous tone of vexation.
5569: 
5570: “Confound John Waule! I did not mean to make you angry. I didn’t know
5571: you had any reason for being grateful to me. I forgot what a great
5572: service you think it if any one snuffs a candle for you.” Fred also had
5573: his pride, and was not going to show that he knew what had called forth
5574: this outburst of Mary’s.
5575: 
5576: “Oh, I am not angry, except with the ways of the world. I do like to be
5577: spoken to as if I had common-sense. I really often feel as if I could
5578: understand a little more than I ever hear even from young gentlemen who
5579: have been to college.” Mary had recovered, and she spoke with a
5580: suppressed rippling under-current of laughter pleasant to hear.
5581: 
5582: “I don’t care how merry you are at my expense this morning,” said Fred,
5583: “I thought you looked so sad when you came up-stairs. It is a shame you
5584: should stay here to be bullied in that way.”
5585: 
5586: “Oh, I have an easy life—by comparison. I have tried being a teacher,
5587: and I am not fit for that: my mind is too fond of wandering on its own
5588: way. I think any hardship is better than pretending to do what one is
5589: paid for, and never really doing it. Everything here I can do as well
5590: as any one else could; perhaps better than some—Rosy, for example.
5591: Though she is just the sort of beautiful creature that is imprisoned
5592: with ogres in fairy tales.”
5593: 
5594: “_Rosy!_” cried Fred, in a tone of profound brotherly scepticism.
5595: 
5596: “Come, Fred!” said Mary, emphatically; “you have no right to be so
5597: critical.”
5598: 
5599: “Do you mean anything particular—just now?”
5600: 
5601: “No, I mean something general—always.”
5602: 
5603: “Oh, that I am idle and extravagant. Well, I am not fit to be a poor
5604: man. I should not have made a bad fellow if I had been rich.”
5605: 
5606: “You would have done your duty in that state of life to which it has
5607: not pleased God to call you,” said Mary, laughing.
5608: 
5609: “Well, I couldn’t do my duty as a clergyman, any more than you could do
5610: yours as a governess. You ought to have a little fellow-feeling there,
5611: Mary.”
5612: 
5613: “I never said you ought to be a clergyman. There are other sorts of
5614: work. It seems to me very miserable not to resolve on some course and
5615: act accordingly.”
5616: 
5617: “So I could, if—” Fred broke off, and stood up, leaning against the
5618: mantel-piece.
5619: 
5620: “If you were sure you should not have a fortune?”
5621: 
5622: “I did not say that. You want to quarrel with me. It is too bad of you
5623: to be guided by what other people say about me.”
5624: 
5625: “How can I want to quarrel with you? I should be quarrelling with all
5626: my new books,” said Mary, lifting the volume on the table. “However
5627: naughty you may be to other people, you are good to me.”
5628: 
5629: “Because I like you better than any one else. But I know you despise
5630: me.”
5631: 
5632: “Yes, I do—a little,” said Mary, nodding, with a smile.
5633: 
5634: “You would admire a stupendous fellow, who would have wise opinions
5635: about everything.”
5636: 
5637: “Yes, I should.” Mary was sewing swiftly, and seemed provokingly
5638: mistress of the situation. When a conversation has taken a wrong turn
5639: for us, we only get farther and farther into the swamp of awkwardness.
5640: This was what Fred Vincy felt.
5641: 
5642: “I suppose a woman is never in love with any one she has always
5643: known—ever since she can remember; as a man often is. It is always some
5644: new fellow who strikes a girl.”
5645: 
5646: “Let me see,” said Mary, the corners of her mouth curling archly; “I
5647: must go back on my experience. There is Juliet—she seems an example of
5648: what you say. But then Ophelia had probably known Hamlet a long while;
5649: and Brenda Troil—she had known Mordaunt Merton ever since they were
5650: children; but then he seems to have been an estimable young man; and
5651: Minna was still more deeply in love with Cleveland, who was a stranger.
5652: Waverley was new to Flora MacIvor; but then she did not fall in love
5653: with him. And there are Olivia and Sophia Primrose, and Corinne—they
5654: may be said to have fallen in love with new men. Altogether, my
5655: experience is rather mixed.”
5656: 
5657: Mary looked up with some roguishness at Fred, and that look of hers was
5658: very dear to him, though the eyes were nothing more than clear windows
5659: where observation sat laughingly. He was certainly an affectionate
5660: fellow, and as he had grown from boy to man, he had grown in love with
5661: his old playmate, notwithstanding that share in the higher education of
5662: the country which had exalted his views of rank and income.
5663: 
5664: “When a man is not loved, it is no use for him to say that he could be
5665: a better fellow—could do anything—I mean, if he were sure of being
5666: loved in return.”
5667: 
5668: “Not of the least use in the world for him to say he _could_ be better.
5669: Might, could, would—they are contemptible auxiliaries.”
5670: 
5671: “I don’t see how a man is to be good for much unless he has some one
5672: woman to love him dearly.”
5673: 
5674: “I think the goodness should come before he expects that.”
5675: 
5676: “You know better, Mary. Women don’t love men for their goodness.”
5677: 
5678: “Perhaps not. But if they love them, they never think them bad.”
5679: 
5680: “It is hardly fair to say I am bad.”
5681: 
5682: “I said nothing at all about you.”
5683: 
5684: “I never shall be good for anything, Mary, if you will not say that you
5685: love me—if you will not promise to marry me—I mean, when I am able to
5686: marry.”
5687: 
5688: “If I did love you, I would not marry you: I would certainly not
5689: promise ever to marry you.”
5690: 
5691: “I think that is quite wicked, Mary. If you love me, you ought to
5692: promise to marry me.”
5693: 
5694: “On the contrary, I think it would be wicked in me to marry you even if
5695: I did love you.”
5696: 
5697: “You mean, just as I am, without any means of maintaining a wife. Of
5698: course: I am but three-and-twenty.”
5699: 
5700: “In that last point you will alter. But I am not so sure of any other
5701: alteration. My father says an idle man ought not to exist, much less,
5702: be married.”
5703: 
5704: “Then I am to blow my brains out?”
5705: 
5706: “No; on the whole I should think you would do better to pass your
5707: examination. I have heard Mr. Farebrother say it is disgracefully
5708: easy.”
5709: 
5710: “That is all very fine. Anything is easy to him. Not that cleverness
5711: has anything to do with it. I am ten times cleverer than many men who
5712: pass.”
5713: 
5714: “Dear me!” said Mary, unable to repress her sarcasm; “that accounts for
5715: the curates like Mr. Crowse. Divide your cleverness by ten, and the
5716: quotient—dear me!—is able to take a degree. But that only shows you are
5717: ten times more idle than the others.”
5718: 
5719: “Well, if I did pass, you would not want me to go into the Church?”
5720: 
5721: “That is not the question—what I want you to do. You have a conscience
5722: of your own, I suppose. There! there is Mr. Lydgate. I must go and tell
5723: my uncle.”
5724: 
5725: “Mary,” said Fred, seizing her hand as she rose; “if you will not give
5726: me some encouragement, I shall get worse instead of better.”
5727: 
5728: “I will not give you any encouragement,” said Mary, reddening. “Your
5729: friends would dislike it, and so would mine. My father would think it a
5730: disgrace to me if I accepted a man who got into debt, and would not
5731: work!”
5732: 
5733: Fred was stung, and released her hand. She walked to the door, but
5734: there she turned and said: “Fred, you have always been so good, so
5735: generous to me. I am not ungrateful. But never speak to me in that way
5736: again.”
5737: 
5738: “Very well,” said Fred, sulkily, taking up his hat and whip. His
5739: complexion showed patches of pale pink and dead white. Like many a
5740: plucked idle young gentleman, he was thoroughly in love, and with a
5741: plain girl, who had no money! But having Mr. Featherstone’s land in the
5742: background, and a persuasion that, let Mary say what she would, she
5743: really did care for him, Fred was not utterly in despair.
5744: 
5745: When he got home, he gave four of the twenties to his mother, asking
5746: her to keep them for him. “I don’t want to spend that money, mother. I
5747: want it to pay a debt with. So keep it safe away from my fingers.”
5748: 
5749: “Bless you, my dear,” said Mrs. Vincy. She doted on her eldest son and
5750: her youngest girl (a child of six), whom others thought her two
5751: naughtiest children. The mother’s eyes are not always deceived in their
5752: partiality: she at least can best judge who is the tender,
5753: filial-hearted child. And Fred was certainly very fond of his mother.
5754: Perhaps it was his fondness for another person also that made him
5755: particularly anxious to take some security against his own liability to
5756: spend the hundred pounds. For the creditor to whom he owed a hundred
5757: and sixty held a firmer security in the shape of a bill signed by
5758: Mary’s father.
5759: 
5760: 
5761: 
5762: 
5763: CHAPTER XV.
5764: 
5765: “Black eyes you have left, you say,
5766:     Blue eyes fail to draw you;
5767: Yet you seem more rapt to-day,
5768:     Than of old we saw you.
5769: 
5770: “Oh, I track the fairest fair
5771:     Through new haunts of pleasure;
5772: Footprints here and echoes there
5773:     Guide me to my treasure:
5774: 
5775: “Lo! she turns—immortal youth
5776:     Wrought to mortal stature,
5777: Fresh as starlight’s aged truth—
5778:     Many-namèd Nature!”
5779: 
5780: 
5781: A great historian, as he insisted on calling himself, who had the
5782: happiness to be dead a hundred and twenty years ago, and so to take his
5783: place among the colossi whose huge legs our living pettiness is
5784: observed to walk under, glories in his copious remarks and digressions
5785: as the least imitable part of his work, and especially in those initial
5786: chapters to the successive books of his history, where he seems to
5787: bring his armchair to the proscenium and chat with us in all the lusty
5788: ease of his fine English. But Fielding lived when the days were longer
5789: (for time, like money, is measured by our needs), when summer
5790: afternoons were spacious, and the clock ticked slowly in the winter
5791: evenings. We belated historians must not linger after his example; and
5792: if we did so, it is probable that our chat would be thin and eager, as
5793: if delivered from a campstool in a parrot-house. I at least have so
5794: much to do in unraveling certain human lots, and seeing how they were
5795: woven and interwoven, that all the light I can command must be
5796: concentrated on this particular web, and not dispersed over that
5797: tempting range of relevancies called the universe.
5798: 
5799: At present I have to make the new settler Lydgate better known to any
5800: one interested in him than he could possibly be even to those who had
5801: seen the most of him since his arrival in Middlemarch. For surely all
5802: must admit that a man may be puffed and belauded, envied, ridiculed,
5803: counted upon as a tool and fallen in love with, or at least selected as
5804: a future husband, and yet remain virtually unknown—known merely as a
5805: cluster of signs for his neighbors’ false suppositions. There was a
5806: general impression, however, that Lydgate was not altogether a common
5807: country doctor, and in Middlemarch at that time such an impression was
5808: significant of great things being expected from him. For everybody’s
5809: family doctor was remarkably clever, and was understood to have
5810: immeasurable skill in the management and training of the most skittish
5811: or vicious diseases. The evidence of his cleverness was of the higher
5812: intuitive order, lying in his lady-patients’ immovable conviction, and
5813: was unassailable by any objection except that their intuitions were
5814: opposed by others equally strong; each lady who saw medical truth in
5815: Wrench and “the strengthening treatment” regarding Toller and “the
5816: lowering system” as medical perdition. For the heroic times of copious
5817: bleeding and blistering had not yet departed, still less the times of
5818: thorough-going theory, when disease in general was called by some bad
5819: name, and treated accordingly without shilly-shally—as if, for example,
5820: it were to be called insurrection, which must not be fired on with
5821: blank-cartridge, but have its blood drawn at once. The strengtheners
5822: and the lowerers were all “clever” men in somebody’s opinion, which is
5823: really as much as can be said for any living talents. Nobody’s
5824: imagination had gone so far as to conjecture that Mr. Lydgate could
5825: know as much as Dr. Sprague and Dr. Minchin, the two physicians, who
5826: alone could offer any hope when danger was extreme, and when the
5827: smallest hope was worth a guinea. Still, I repeat, there was a general
5828: impression that Lydgate was something rather more uncommon than any
5829: general practitioner in Middlemarch. And this was true. He was but
5830: seven-and-twenty, an age at which many men are not quite common—at
5831: which they are hopeful of achievement, resolute in avoidance, thinking
5832: that Mammon shall never put a bit in their mouths and get astride their
5833: backs, but rather that Mammon, if they have anything to do with him,
5834: shall draw their chariot.
5835: 
5836: He had been left an orphan when he was fresh from a public school. His
5837: father, a military man, had made but little provision for three
5838: children, and when the boy Tertius asked to have a medical education,
5839: it seemed easier to his guardians to grant his request by apprenticing
5840: him to a country practitioner than to make any objections on the score
5841: of family dignity. He was one of the rarer lads who early get a decided
5842: bent and make up their minds that there is something particular in life
5843: which they would like to do for its own sake, and not because their
5844: fathers did it. Most of us who turn to any subject with love remember
5845: some morning or evening hour when we got on a high stool to reach down
5846: an untried volume, or sat with parted lips listening to a new talker,
5847: or for very lack of books began to listen to the voices within, as the
5848: first traceable beginning of our love. Something of that sort happened
5849: to Lydgate. He was a quick fellow, and when hot from play, would toss
5850: himself in a corner, and in five minutes be deep in any sort of book
5851: that he could lay his hands on: if it were Rasselas or Gulliver, so
5852: much the better, but Bailey’s Dictionary would do, or the Bible with
5853: the Apocrypha in it. Something he must read, when he was not riding the
5854: pony, or running and hunting, or listening to the talk of men. All this
5855: was true of him at ten years of age; he had then read through “Chrysal,
5856: or the Adventures of a Guinea,” which was neither milk for babes, nor
5857: any chalky mixture meant to pass for milk, and it had already occurred
5858: to him that books were stuff, and that life was stupid. His school
5859: studies had not much modified that opinion, for though he “did” his
5860: classics and mathematics, he was not pre-eminent in them. It was said
5861: of him, that Lydgate could do anything he liked, but he had certainly
5862: not yet liked to do anything remarkable. He was a vigorous animal with
5863: a ready understanding, but no spark had yet kindled in him an
5864: intellectual passion; knowledge seemed to him a very superficial
5865: affair, easily mastered: judging from the conversation of his elders,
5866: he had apparently got already more than was necessary for mature life.
5867: Probably this was not an exceptional result of expensive teaching at
5868: that period of short-waisted coats, and other fashions which have not
5869: yet recurred. But, one vacation, a wet day sent him to the small home
5870: library to hunt once more for a book which might have some freshness
5871: for him: in vain! unless, indeed, he took down a dusty row of volumes
5872: with gray-paper backs and dingy labels—the volumes of an old
5873: Cyclopaedia which he had never disturbed. It would at least be a
5874: novelty to disturb them. They were on the highest shelf, and he stood
5875: on a chair to get them down. But he opened the volume which he first
5876: took from the shelf: somehow, one is apt to read in a makeshift
5877: attitude, just where it might seem inconvenient to do so. The page he
5878: opened on was under the head of Anatomy, and the first passage that
5879: drew his eyes was on the valves of the heart. He was not much
5880: acquainted with valves of any sort, but he knew that valvae were
5881: folding-doors, and through this crevice came a sudden light startling
5882: him with his first vivid notion of finely adjusted mechanism in the
5883: human frame. A liberal education had of course left him free to read
5884: the indecent passages in the school classics, but beyond a general
5885: sense of secrecy and obscenity in connection with his internal
5886: structure, had left his imagination quite unbiassed, so that for
5887: anything he knew his brains lay in small bags at his temples, and he
5888: had no more thought of representing to himself how his blood circulated
5889: than how paper served instead of gold. But the moment of vocation had
5890: come, and before he got down from his chair, the world was made new to
5891: him by a presentiment of endless processes filling the vast spaces
5892: planked out of his sight by that wordy ignorance which he had supposed
5893: to be knowledge. From that hour Lydgate felt the growth of an
5894: intellectual passion.
5895: 
5896: We are not afraid of telling over and over again how a man comes to
5897: fall in love with a woman and be wedded to her, or else be fatally
5898: parted from her. Is it due to excess of poetry or of stupidity that we
5899: are never weary of describing what King James called a woman’s “makdom
5900: and her fairnesse,” never weary of listening to the twanging of the old
5901: Troubadour strings, and are comparatively uninterested in that other
5902: kind of “makdom and fairnesse” which must be wooed with industrious
5903: thought and patient renunciation of small desires? In the story of this
5904: passion, too, the development varies: sometimes it is the glorious
5905: marriage, sometimes frustration and final parting. And not seldom the
5906: catastrophe is bound up with the other passion, sung by the
5907: Troubadours. For in the multitude of middle-aged men who go about their
5908: vocations in a daily course determined for them much in the same way as
5909: the tie of their cravats, there is always a good number who once meant
5910: to shape their own deeds and alter the world a little. The story of
5911: their coming to be shapen after the average and fit to be packed by the
5912: gross, is hardly ever told even in their consciousness; for perhaps
5913: their ardor in generous unpaid toil cooled as imperceptibly as the
5914: ardor of other youthful loves, till one day their earlier self walked
5915: like a ghost in its old home and made the new furniture ghastly.
5916: Nothing in the world more subtle than the process of their gradual
5917: change! In the beginning they inhaled it unknowingly: you and I may
5918: have sent some of our breath towards infecting them, when we uttered
5919: our conforming falsities or drew our silly conclusions: or perhaps it
5920: came with the vibrations from a woman’s glance.
5921: 
5922: Lydgate did not mean to be one of those failures, and there was the
5923: better hope of him because his scientific interest soon took the form
5924: of a professional enthusiasm: he had a youthful belief in his
5925: bread-winning work, not to be stifled by that initiation in makeshift
5926: called his ’prentice days; and he carried to his studies in London,
5927: Edinburgh, and Paris, the conviction that the medical profession as it
5928: might be was the finest in the world; presenting the most perfect
5929: interchange between science and art; offering the most direct alliance
5930: between intellectual conquest and the social good. Lydgate’s nature
5931: demanded this combination: he was an emotional creature, with a
5932: flesh-and-blood sense of fellowship which withstood all the
5933: abstractions of special study. He cared not only for “cases,” but for
5934: John and Elizabeth, especially Elizabeth.
5935: 
5936: There was another attraction in his profession: it wanted reform, and
5937: gave a man an opportunity for some indignant resolve to reject its
5938: venal decorations and other humbug, and to be the possessor of genuine
5939: though undemanded qualifications. He went to study in Paris with the
5940: determination that when he came home again he would settle in some
5941: provincial town as a general practitioner, and resist the irrational
5942: severance between medical and surgical knowledge in the interest of his
5943: own scientific pursuits, as well as of the general advance: he would
5944: keep away from the range of London intrigues, jealousies, and social
5945: truckling, and win celebrity, however slowly, as Jenner had done, by
5946: the independent value of his work. For it must be remembered that this
5947: was a dark period; and in spite of venerable colleges which used great
5948: efforts to secure purity of knowledge by making it scarce, and to
5949: exclude error by a rigid exclusiveness in relation to fees and
5950: appointments, it happened that very ignorant young gentlemen were
5951: promoted in town, and many more got a legal right to practise over
5952: large areas in the country. Also, the high standard held up to the
5953: public mind by the College of Physicians, which gave its peculiar
5954: sanction to the expensive and highly rarefied medical instruction
5955: obtained by graduates of Oxford and Cambridge, did not hinder quackery
5956: from having an excellent time of it; for since professional practice
5957: chiefly consisted in giving a great many drugs, the public inferred
5958: that it might be better off with more drugs still, if they could only
5959: be got cheaply, and hence swallowed large cubic measures of physic
5960: prescribed by unscrupulous ignorance which had taken no degrees.
5961: Considering that statistics had not yet embraced a calculation as to
5962: the number of ignorant or canting doctors which absolutely must exist
5963: in the teeth of all changes, it seemed to Lydgate that a change in the
5964: units was the most direct mode of changing the numbers. He meant to be
5965: a unit who would make a certain amount of difference towards that
5966: spreading change which would one day tell appreciably upon the
5967: averages, and in the mean time have the pleasure of making an
5968: advantageous difference to the viscera of his own patients. But he did
5969: not simply aim at a more genuine kind of practice than was common. He
5970: was ambitious of a wider effect: he was fired with the possibility that
5971: he might work out the proof of an anatomical conception and make a link
5972: in the chain of discovery.
5973: 
5974: Does it seem incongruous to you that a Middlemarch surgeon should dream
5975: of himself as a discoverer? Most of us, indeed, know little of the
5976: great originators until they have been lifted up among the
5977: constellations and already rule our fates. But that Herschel, for
5978: example, who “broke the barriers of the heavens”—did he not once play a
5979: provincial church-organ, and give music-lessons to stumbling pianists?
5980: Each of those Shining Ones had to walk on the earth among neighbors who
5981: perhaps thought much more of his gait and his garments than of anything
5982: which was to give him a title to everlasting fame: each of them had his
5983: little local personal history sprinkled with small temptations and
5984: sordid cares, which made the retarding friction of his course towards
5985: final companionship with the immortals. Lydgate was not blind to the
5986: dangers of such friction, but he had plenty of confidence in his
5987: resolution to avoid it as far as possible: being seven-and-twenty, he
5988: felt himself experienced. And he was not going to have his vanities
5989: provoked by contact with the showy worldly successes of the capital,
5990: but to live among people who could hold no rivalry with that pursuit of
5991: a great idea which was to be a twin object with the assiduous practice
5992: of his profession. There was fascination in the hope that the two
5993: purposes would illuminate each other: the careful observation and
5994: inference which was his daily work, the use of the lens to further his
5995: judgment in special cases, would further his thought as an instrument
5996: of larger inquiry. Was not this the typical pre-eminence of his
5997: profession? He would be a good Middlemarch doctor, and by that very
5998: means keep himself in the track of far-reaching investigation. On one
5999: point he may fairly claim approval at this particular stage of his
6000: career: he did not mean to imitate those philanthropic models who make
6001: a profit out of poisonous pickles to support themselves while they are
6002: exposing adulteration, or hold shares in a gambling-hell that they may
6003: have leisure to represent the cause of public morality. He intended to
6004: begin in his own case some particular reforms which were quite
6005: certainly within his reach, and much less of a problem than the
6006: demonstrating of an anatomical conception. One of these reforms was to
6007: act stoutly on the strength of a recent legal decision, and simply
6008: prescribe, without dispensing drugs or taking percentage from
6009: druggists. This was an innovation for one who had chosen to adopt the
6010: style of general practitioner in a country town, and would be felt as
6011: offensive criticism by his professional brethren. But Lydgate meant to
6012: innovate in his treatment also, and he was wise enough to see that the
6013: best security for his practising honestly according to his belief was
6014: to get rid of systematic temptations to the contrary.
6015: 
6016: Perhaps that was a more cheerful time for observers and theorizers than
6017: the present; we are apt to think it the finest era of the world when
6018: America was beginning to be discovered, when a bold sailor, even if he
6019: were wrecked, might alight on a new kingdom; and about 1829 the dark
6020: territories of Pathology were a fine America for a spirited young
6021: adventurer. Lydgate was ambitious above all to contribute towards
6022: enlarging the scientific, rational basis of his profession. The more he
6023: became interested in special questions of disease, such as the nature
6024: of fever or fevers, the more keenly he felt the need for that
6025: fundamental knowledge of structure which just at the beginning of the
6026: century had been illuminated by the brief and glorious career of
6027: Bichat, who died when he was only one-and-thirty, but, like another
6028: Alexander, left a realm large enough for many heirs. That great
6029: Frenchman first carried out the conception that living bodies,
6030: fundamentally considered, are not associations of organs which can be
6031: understood by studying them first apart, and then as it were federally;
6032: but must be regarded as consisting of certain primary webs or tissues,
6033: out of which the various organs—brain, heart, lungs, and so on—are
6034: compacted, as the various accommodations of a house are built up in
6035: various proportions of wood, iron, stone, brick, zinc, and the rest,
6036: each material having its peculiar composition and proportions. No man,
6037: one sees, can understand and estimate the entire structure or its
6038: parts—what are its frailties and what its repairs, without knowing the
6039: nature of the materials. And the conception wrought out by Bichat, with
6040: his detailed study of the different tissues, acted necessarily on
6041: medical questions as the turning of gas-light would act on a dim,
6042: oil-lit street, showing new connections and hitherto hidden facts of
6043: structure which must be taken into account in considering the symptoms
6044: of maladies and the action of medicaments. But results which depend on
6045: human conscience and intelligence work slowly, and now at the end of
6046: 1829, most medical practice was still strutting or shambling along the
6047: old paths, and there was still scientific work to be done which might
6048: have seemed to be a direct sequence of Bichat’s. This great seer did
6049: not go beyond the consideration of the tissues as ultimate facts in the
6050: living organism, marking the limit of anatomical analysis; but it was
6051: open to another mind to say, have not these structures some common
6052: basis from which they have all started, as your sarsnet, gauze, net,
6053: satin, and velvet from the raw cocoon? Here would be another light, as
6054: of oxy-hydrogen, showing the very grain of things, and revising all
6055: former explanations. Of this sequence to Bichat’s work, already
6056: vibrating along many currents of the European mind, Lydgate was
6057: enamoured; he longed to demonstrate the more intimate relations of
6058: living structure, and help to define men’s thought more accurately
6059: after the true order. The work had not yet been done, but only prepared
6060: for those who knew how to use the preparation. What was the primitive
6061: tissue? In that way Lydgate put the question—not quite in the way
6062: required by the awaiting answer; but such missing of the right word
6063: befalls many seekers. And he counted on quiet intervals to be
6064: watchfully seized, for taking up the threads of investigation—on many
6065: hints to be won from diligent application, not only of the scalpel, but
6066: of the microscope, which research had begun to use again with new
6067: enthusiasm of reliance. Such was Lydgate’s plan of his future: to do
6068: good small work for Middlemarch, and great work for the world.
6069: 
6070: He was certainly a happy fellow at this time: to be seven-and-twenty,
6071: without any fixed vices, with a generous resolution that his action
6072: should be beneficent, and with ideas in his brain that made life
6073: interesting quite apart from the cultus of horseflesh and other mystic
6074: rites of costly observance, which the eight hundred pounds left him
6075: after buying his practice would certainly not have gone far in paying
6076: for. He was at a starting-point which makes many a man’s career a fine
6077: subject for betting, if there were any gentlemen given to that
6078: amusement who could appreciate the complicated probabilities of an
6079: arduous purpose, with all the possible thwartings and furtherings of
6080: circumstance, all the niceties of inward balance, by which a man swims
6081: and makes his point or else is carried headlong. The risk would remain
6082: even with close knowledge of Lydgate’s character; for character too is
6083: a process and an unfolding. The man was still in the making, as much as
6084: the Middlemarch doctor and immortal discoverer, and there were both
6085: virtues and faults capable of shrinking or expanding. The faults will
6086: not, I hope, be a reason for the withdrawal of your interest in him.
6087: Among our valued friends is there not some one or other who is a little
6088: too self-confident and disdainful; whose distinguished mind is a little
6089: spotted with commonness; who is a little pinched here and protuberant
6090: there with native prejudices; or whose better energies are liable to
6091: lapse down the wrong channel under the influence of transient
6092: solicitations? All these things might be alleged against Lydgate, but
6093: then, they are the periphrases of a polite preacher, who talks of Adam,
6094: and would not like to mention anything painful to the pew-renters. The
6095: particular faults from which these delicate generalities are distilled
6096: have distinguishable physiognomies, diction, accent, and grimaces;
6097: filling up parts in very various dramas. Our vanities differ as our
6098: noses do: all conceit is not the same conceit, but varies in
6099: correspondence with the minutiae of mental make in which one of us
6100: differs from another. Lydgate’s conceit was of the arrogant sort, never
6101: simpering, never impertinent, but massive in its claims and
6102: benevolently contemptuous. He would do a great deal for noodles, being
6103: sorry for them, and feeling quite sure that they could have no power
6104: over him: he had thought of joining the Saint Simonians when he was in
6105: Paris, in order to turn them against some of their own doctrines. All
6106: his faults were marked by kindred traits, and were those of a man who
6107: had a fine baritone, whose clothes hung well upon him, and who even in
6108: his ordinary gestures had an air of inbred distinction. Where then lay
6109: the spots of commonness? says a young lady enamoured of that careless
6110: grace. How could there be any commonness in a man so well-bred, so
6111: ambitious of social distinction, so generous and unusual in his views
6112: of social duty? As easily as there may be stupidity in a man of genius
6113: if you take him unawares on the wrong subject, or as many a man who has
6114: the best will to advance the social millennium might be ill-inspired in
6115: imagining its lighter pleasures; unable to go beyond Offenbach’s music,
6116: or the brilliant punning in the last burlesque. Lydgate’s spots of
6117: commonness lay in the complexion of his prejudices, which, in spite of
6118: noble intention and sympathy, were half of them such as are found in
6119: ordinary men of the world: that distinction of mind which belonged to
6120: his intellectual ardor, did not penetrate his feeling and judgment
6121: about furniture, or women, or the desirability of its being known
6122: (without his telling) that he was better born than other country
6123: surgeons. He did not mean to think of furniture at present; but
6124: whenever he did so it was to be feared that neither biology nor schemes
6125: of reform would lift him above the vulgarity of feeling that there
6126: would be an incompatibility in his furniture not being of the best.
6127: 
6128: As to women, he had once already been drawn headlong by impetuous
6129: folly, which he meant to be final, since marriage at some distant
6130: period would of course not be impetuous. For those who want to be
6131: acquainted with Lydgate it will be good to know what was that case of
6132: impetuous folly, for it may stand as an example of the fitful swerving
6133: of passion to which he was prone, together with the chivalrous kindness
6134: which helped to make him morally lovable. The story can be told without
6135: many words. It happened when he was studying in Paris, and just at the
6136: time when, over and above his other work, he was occupied with some
6137: galvanic experiments. One evening, tired with his experimenting, and
6138: not being able to elicit the facts he needed, he left his frogs and
6139: rabbits to some repose under their trying and mysterious dispensation
6140: of unexplained shocks, and went to finish his evening at the theatre of
6141: the Porte Saint Martin, where there was a melodrama which he had
6142: already seen several times; attracted, not by the ingenious work of the
6143: collaborating authors, but by an actress whose part it was to stab her
6144: lover, mistaking him for the evil-designing duke of the piece. Lydgate
6145: was in love with this actress, as a man is in love with a woman whom he
6146: never expects to speak to. She was a Provencale, with dark eyes, a
6147: Greek profile, and rounded majestic form, having that sort of beauty
6148: which carries a sweet matronliness even in youth, and her voice was a
6149: soft cooing. She had but lately come to Paris, and bore a virtuous
6150: reputation, her husband acting with her as the unfortunate lover. It
6151: was her acting which was “no better than it should be,” but the public
6152: was satisfied. Lydgate’s only relaxation now was to go and look at this
6153: woman, just as he might have thrown himself under the breath of the
6154: sweet south on a bank of violets for a while, without prejudice to his
6155: galvanism, to which he would presently return. But this evening the old
6156: drama had a new catastrophe. At the moment when the heroine was to act
6157: the stabbing of her lover, and he was to fall gracefully, the wife
6158: veritably stabbed her husband, who fell as death willed. A wild shriek
6159: pierced the house, and the Provencale fell swooning: a shriek and a
6160: swoon were demanded by the play, but the swooning too was real this
6161: time. Lydgate leaped and climbed, he hardly knew how, on to the stage,
6162: and was active in help, making the acquaintance of his heroine by
6163: finding a contusion on her head and lifting her gently in his arms.
6164: Paris rang with the story of this death:—was it a murder? Some of the
6165: actress’s warmest admirers were inclined to believe in her guilt, and
6166: liked her the better for it (such was the taste of those times); but
6167: Lydgate was not one of these. He vehemently contended for her
6168: innocence, and the remote impersonal passion for her beauty which he
6169: had felt before, had passed now into personal devotion, and tender
6170: thought of her lot. The notion of murder was absurd: no motive was
6171: discoverable, the young couple being understood to dote on each other;
6172: and it was not unprecedented that an accidental slip of the foot should
6173: have brought these grave consequences. The legal investigation ended in
6174: Madame Laure’s release. Lydgate by this time had had many interviews
6175: with her, and found her more and more adorable. She talked little; but
6176: that was an additional charm. She was melancholy, and seemed grateful;
6177: her presence was enough, like that of the evening light. Lydgate was
6178: madly anxious about her affection, and jealous lest any other man than
6179: himself should win it and ask her to marry him. But instead of
6180: reopening her engagement at the Porte Saint Martin, where she would
6181: have been all the more popular for the fatal episode, she left Paris
6182: without warning, forsaking her little court of admirers. Perhaps no one
6183: carried inquiry far except Lydgate, who felt that all science had come
6184: to a stand-still while he imagined the unhappy Laure, stricken by
6185: ever-wandering sorrow, herself wandering, and finding no faithful
6186: comforter. Hidden actresses, however, are not so difficult to find as
6187: some other hidden facts, and it was not long before Lydgate gathered
6188: indications that Laure had taken the route to Lyons. He found her at
6189: last acting with great success at Avignon under the same name, looking
6190: more majestic than ever as a forsaken wife carrying her child in her
6191: arms. He spoke to her after the play, was received with the usual
6192: quietude which seemed to him beautiful as clear depths of water, and
6193: obtained leave to visit her the next day; when he was bent on telling
6194: her that he adored her, and on asking her to marry him. He knew that
6195: this was like the sudden impulse of a madman—incongruous even with his
6196: habitual foibles. No matter! It was the one thing which he was resolved
6197: to do. He had two selves within him apparently, and they must learn to
6198: accommodate each other and bear reciprocal impediments. Strange, that
6199: some of us, with quick alternate vision, see beyond our infatuations,
6200: and even while we rave on the heights, behold the wide plain where our
6201: persistent self pauses and awaits us.
6202: 
6203: To have approached Laure with any suit that was not reverentially
6204: tender would have been simply a contradiction of his whole feeling
6205: towards her.
6206: 
6207: “You have come all the way from Paris to find me?” she said to him the
6208: next day, sitting before him with folded arms, and looking at him with
6209: eyes that seemed to wonder as an untamed ruminating animal wonders.
6210: “Are all Englishmen like that?”
6211: 
6212: “I came because I could not live without trying to see you. You are
6213: lonely; I love you; I want you to consent to be my wife; I will wait,
6214: but I want you to promise that you will marry me—no one else.”
6215: 
6216: Laure looked at him in silence with a melancholy radiance from under
6217: her grand eyelids, until he was full of rapturous certainty, and knelt
6218: close to her knees.
6219: 
6220: “I will tell you something,” she said, in her cooing way, keeping her
6221: arms folded. “My foot really slipped.”
6222: 
6223: “I know, I know,” said Lydgate, deprecatingly. “It was a fatal
6224: accident—a dreadful stroke of calamity that bound me to you the more.”
6225: 
6226: Again Laure paused a little and then said, slowly, “_I meant to do
6227: it._”
6228: 
6229: Lydgate, strong man as he was, turned pale and trembled: moments seemed
6230: to pass before he rose and stood at a distance from her.
6231: 
6232: “There was a secret, then,” he said at last, even vehemently. “He was
6233: brutal to you: you hated him.”
6234: 
6235: “No! he wearied me; he was too fond: he would live in Paris, and not in
6236: my country; that was not agreeable to me.”
6237: 
6238: “Great God!” said Lydgate, in a groan of horror. “And you planned to
6239: murder him?”
6240: 
6241: “I did not plan: it came to me in the play—_I meant to do it._”
6242: 
6243: Lydgate stood mute, and unconsciously pressed his hat on while he
6244: looked at her. He saw this woman—the first to whom he had given his
6245: young adoration—amid the throng of stupid criminals.
6246: 
6247: “You are a good young man,” she said. “But I do not like husbands. I
6248: will never have another.”
6249: 
6250: Three days afterwards Lydgate was at his galvanism again in his Paris
6251: chambers, believing that illusions were at an end for him. He was saved
6252: from hardening effects by the abundant kindness of his heart and his
6253: belief that human life might be made better. But he had more reason
6254: than ever for trusting his judgment, now that it was so experienced;
6255: and henceforth he would take a strictly scientific view of woman,
6256: entertaining no expectations but such as were justified beforehand.
6257: 
6258: No one in Middlemarch was likely to have such a notion of Lydgate’s
6259: past as has here been faintly shadowed, and indeed the respectable
6260: townsfolk there were not more given than mortals generally to any eager
6261: attempt at exactness in the representation to themselves of what did
6262: not come under their own senses. Not only young virgins of that town,
6263: but gray-bearded men also, were often in haste to conjecture how a new
6264: acquaintance might be wrought into their purposes, contented with very
6265: vague knowledge as to the way in which life had been shaping him for
6266: that instrumentality. Middlemarch, in fact, counted on swallowing
6267: Lydgate and assimilating him very comfortably.
6268: 
6269: 
6270: 
6271: 
6272: CHAPTER XVI.
6273: 
6274: “All that in woman is adored
6275:     In thy fair self I find—
6276: For the whole sex can but afford
6277:     The handsome and the kind.”
6278: —SIR CHARLES SEDLEY.
6279: 
6280: 
6281: The question whether Mr. Tyke should be appointed as salaried chaplain
6282: to the hospital was an exciting topic to the Middlemarchers; and
6283: Lydgate heard it discussed in a way that threw much light on the power
6284: exercised in the town by Mr. Bulstrode. The banker was evidently a
6285: ruler, but there was an opposition party, and even among his supporters
6286: there were some who allowed it to be seen that their support was a
6287: compromise, and who frankly stated their impression that the general
6288: scheme of things, and especially the casualties of trade, required you
6289: to hold a candle to the devil.
6290: 
6291: Mr. Bulstrode’s power was not due simply to his being a country banker,
6292: who knew the financial secrets of most traders in the town and could
6293: touch the springs of their credit; it was fortified by a beneficence
6294: that was at once ready and severe—ready to confer obligations, and
6295: severe in watching the result. He had gathered, as an industrious man
6296: always at his post, a chief share in administering the town charities,
6297: and his private charities were both minute and abundant. He would take
6298: a great deal of pains about apprenticing Tegg the shoemaker’s son, and
6299: he would watch over Tegg’s church-going; he would defend Mrs. Strype
6300: the washerwoman against Stubbs’s unjust exaction on the score of her
6301: drying-ground, and he would himself scrutinize a calumny against Mrs.
6302: Strype. His private minor loans were numerous, but he would inquire
6303: strictly into the circumstances both before and after. In this way a
6304: man gathers a domain in his neighbors’ hope and fear as well as
6305: gratitude; and power, when once it has got into that subtle region,
6306: propagates itself, spreading out of all proportion to its external
6307: means. It was a principle with Mr. Bulstrode to gain as much power as
6308: possible, that he might use it for the glory of God. He went through a
6309: great deal of spiritual conflict and inward argument in order to adjust
6310: his motives, and make clear to himself what God’s glory required. But,
6311: as we have seen, his motives were not always rightly appreciated. There
6312: were many crass minds in Middlemarch whose reflective scales could only
6313: weigh things in the lump; and they had a strong suspicion that since
6314: Mr. Bulstrode could not enjoy life in their fashion, eating and
6315: drinking so little as he did, and worreting himself about everything,
6316: he must have a sort of vampire’s feast in the sense of mastery.
6317: 
6318: The subject of the chaplaincy came up at Mr. Vincy’s table when Lydgate
6319: was dining there, and the family connection with Mr. Bulstrode did not,
6320: he observed, prevent some freedom of remark even on the part of the
6321: host himself, though his reasons against the proposed arrangement
6322: turned entirely on his objection to Mr. Tyke’s sermons, which were all
6323: doctrine, and his preference for Mr. Farebrother, whose sermons were
6324: free from that taint. Mr. Vincy liked well enough the notion of the
6325: chaplain’s having a salary, supposing it were given to Farebrother, who
6326: was as good a little fellow as ever breathed, and the best preacher
6327: anywhere, and companionable too.
6328: 
6329: “What line shall you take, then?” said Mr. Chichely, the coroner, a
6330: great coursing comrade of Mr. Vincy’s.
6331: 
6332: “Oh, I’m precious glad I’m not one of the Directors now. I shall vote
6333: for referring the matter to the Directors and the Medical Board
6334: together. I shall roll some of my responsibility on your shoulders,
6335: Doctor,” said Mr. Vincy, glancing first at Dr. Sprague, the senior
6336: physician of the town, and then at Lydgate who sat opposite. “You
6337: medical gentlemen must consult which sort of black draught you will
6338: prescribe, eh, Mr. Lydgate?”
6339: 
6340: “I know little of either,” said Lydgate; “but in general, appointments
6341: are apt to be made too much a question of personal liking. The fittest
6342: man for a particular post is not always the best fellow or the most
6343: agreeable. Sometimes, if you wanted to get a reform, your only way
6344: would be to pension off the good fellows whom everybody is fond of, and
6345: put them out of the question.”
6346: 
6347: Dr. Sprague, who was considered the physician of most “weight,” though
6348: Dr. Minchin was usually said to have more “penetration,” divested his
6349: large heavy face of all expression, and looked at his wine-glass while
6350: Lydgate was speaking. Whatever was not problematical and suspected
6351: about this young man—for example, a certain showiness as to foreign
6352: ideas, and a disposition to unsettle what had been settled and
6353: forgotten by his elders—was positively unwelcome to a physician whose
6354: standing had been fixed thirty years before by a treatise on
6355: Meningitis, of which at least one copy marked “own” was bound in calf.
6356: For my part I have some fellow-feeling with Dr. Sprague: one’s
6357: self-satisfaction is an untaxed kind of property which it is very
6358: unpleasant to find deprecated.
6359: 
6360: Lydgate’s remark, however, did not meet the sense of the company. Mr.
6361: Vincy said, that if he could have _his_ way, he would not put
6362: disagreeable fellows anywhere.
6363: 
6364: “Hang your reforms!” said Mr. Chichely. “There’s no greater humbug in
6365: the world. You never hear of a reform, but it means some trick to put
6366: in new men. I hope you are not one of the ‘Lancet’s’ men, Mr.
6367: Lydgate—wanting to take the coronership out of the hands of the legal
6368: profession: your words appear to point that way.”
6369: 
6370: “I disapprove of Wakley,” interposed Dr. Sprague, “no man more: he is
6371: an ill-intentioned fellow, who would sacrifice the respectability of
6372: the profession, which everybody knows depends on the London Colleges,
6373: for the sake of getting some notoriety for himself. There are men who
6374: don’t mind about being kicked blue if they can only get talked about.
6375: But Wakley is right sometimes,” the Doctor added, judicially. “I could
6376: mention one or two points in which Wakley is in the right.”
6377: 
6378: “Oh, well,” said Mr. Chichely, “I blame no man for standing up in favor
6379: of his own cloth; but, coming to argument, I should like to know how a
6380: coroner is to judge of evidence if he has not had a legal training?”
6381: 
6382: “In my opinion,” said Lydgate, “legal training only makes a man more
6383: incompetent in questions that require knowledge of another kind. People
6384: talk about evidence as if it could really be weighed in scales by a
6385: blind Justice. No man can judge what is good evidence on any particular
6386: subject, unless he knows that subject well. A lawyer is no better than
6387: an old woman at a post-mortem examination. How is he to know the action
6388: of a poison? You might as well say that scanning verse will teach you
6389: to scan the potato crops.”
6390: 
6391: “You are aware, I suppose, that it is not the coroner’s business to
6392: conduct the _post-mortem_, but only to take the evidence of the medical
6393: witness?” said Mr. Chichely, with some scorn.
6394: 
6395: “Who is often almost as ignorant as the coroner himself,” said Lydgate.
6396: “Questions of medical jurisprudence ought not to be left to the chance
6397: of decent knowledge in a medical witness, and the coroner ought not to
6398: be a man who will believe that strychnine will destroy the coats of the
6399: stomach if an ignorant practitioner happens to tell him so.”
6400: 
6401: Lydgate had really lost sight of the fact that Mr. Chichely was his
6402: Majesty’s coroner, and ended innocently with the question, “Don’t you
6403: agree with me, Dr. Sprague?”
6404: 
6405: “To a certain extent—with regard to populous districts, and in the
6406: metropolis,” said the Doctor. “But I hope it will be long before this
6407: part of the country loses the services of my friend Chichely, even
6408: though it might get the best man in our profession to succeed him. I am
6409: sure Vincy will agree with me.”
6410: 
6411: “Yes, yes, give me a coroner who is a good coursing man,” said Mr.
6412: Vincy, jovially. “And in my opinion, you’re safest with a lawyer.
6413: Nobody can know everything. Most things are ‘visitation of God.’ And as
6414: to poisoning, why, what you want to know is the law. Come, shall we
6415: join the ladies?”
6416: 
6417: Lydgate’s private opinion was that Mr. Chichely might be the very
6418: coroner without bias as to the coats of the stomach, but he had not
6419: meant to be personal. This was one of the difficulties of moving in
6420: good Middlemarch society: it was dangerous to insist on knowledge as a
6421: qualification for any salaried office. Fred Vincy had called Lydgate a
6422: prig, and now Mr. Chichely was inclined to call him prick-eared;
6423: especially when, in the drawing-room, he seemed to be making himself
6424: eminently agreeable to Rosamond, whom he had easily monopolized in a
6425: _tête-à-tête_, since Mrs. Vincy herself sat at the tea-table. She
6426: resigned no domestic function to her daughter; and the matron’s
6427: blooming good-natured face, with the two volatile pink strings floating
6428: from her fine throat, and her cheery manners to husband and children,
6429: was certainly among the great attractions of the Vincy
6430: house—attractions which made it all the easier to fall in love with the
6431: daughter. The tinge of unpretentious, inoffensive vulgarity in Mrs.
6432: Vincy gave more effect to Rosamond’s refinement, which was beyond what
6433: Lydgate had expected.
6434: 
6435: Certainly, small feet and perfectly turned shoulders aid the impression
6436: of refined manners, and the right thing said seems quite astonishingly
6437: right when it is accompanied with exquisite curves of lip and eyelid.
6438: And Rosamond could say the right thing; for she was clever with that
6439: sort of cleverness which catches every tone except the humorous.
6440: Happily she never attempted to joke, and this perhaps was the most
6441: decisive mark of her cleverness.
6442: 
6443: She and Lydgate readily got into conversation. He regretted that he had
6444: not heard her sing the other day at Stone Court. The only pleasure he
6445: allowed himself during the latter part of his stay in Paris was to go
6446: and hear music.
6447: 
6448: “You have studied music, probably?” said Rosamond.
6449: 
6450: “No, I know the notes of many birds, and I know many melodies by ear;
6451: but the music that I don’t know at all, and have no notion about,
6452: delights me—affects me. How stupid the world is that it does not make
6453: more use of such a pleasure within its reach!”
6454: 
6455: “Yes, and you will find Middlemarch very tuneless. There are hardly any
6456: good musicians. I only know two gentlemen who sing at all well.”
6457: 
6458: “I suppose it is the fashion to sing comic songs in a rhythmic way,
6459: leaving you to fancy the tune—very much as if it were tapped on a
6460: drum?”
6461: 
6462: “Ah, you have heard Mr. Bowyer,” said Rosamond, with one of her rare
6463: smiles. “But we are speaking very ill of our neighbors.”
6464: 
6465: Lydgate was almost forgetting that he must carry on the conversation,
6466: in thinking how lovely this creature was, her garment seeming to be
6467: made out of the faintest blue sky, herself so immaculately blond, as if
6468: the petals of some gigantic flower had just opened and disclosed her;
6469: and yet with this infantine blondness showing so much ready,
6470: self-possessed grace. Since he had had the memory of Laure, Lydgate had
6471: lost all taste for large-eyed silence: the divine cow no longer
6472: attracted him, and Rosamond was her very opposite. But he recalled
6473: himself.
6474: 
6475: “You will let me hear some music to-night, I hope.”
6476: 
6477: “I will let you hear my attempts, if you like,” said Rosamond. “Papa is
6478: sure to insist on my singing. But I shall tremble before you, who have
6479: heard the best singers in Paris. I have heard very little: I have only
6480: once been to London. But our organist at St. Peter’s is a good
6481: musician, and I go on studying with him.”
6482: 
6483: “Tell me what you saw in London.”
6484: 
6485: “Very little.” (A more naive girl would have said, “Oh, everything!”
6486: But Rosamond knew better.) “A few of the ordinary sights, such as raw
6487: country girls are always taken to.”
6488: 
6489: “Do you call yourself a raw country girl?” said Lydgate, looking at her
6490: with an involuntary emphasis of admiration, which made Rosamond blush
6491: with pleasure. But she remained simply serious, turned her long neck a
6492: little, and put up her hand to touch her wondrous hair-plaits—an
6493: habitual gesture with her as pretty as any movements of a kitten’s paw.
6494: Not that Rosamond was in the least like a kitten: she was a sylph
6495: caught young and educated at Mrs. Lemon’s.
6496: 
6497: “I assure you my mind is raw,” she said immediately; “I pass at
6498: Middlemarch. I am not afraid of talking to our old neighbors. But I am
6499: really afraid of you.”
6500: 
6501: “An accomplished woman almost always knows more than we men, though her
6502: knowledge is of a different sort. I am sure you could teach me a
6503: thousand things—as an exquisite bird could teach a bear if there were
6504: any common language between them. Happily, there is a common language
6505: between women and men, and so the bears can get taught.”
6506: 
6507: “Ah, there is Fred beginning to strum! I must go and hinder him from
6508: jarring all your nerves,” said Rosamond, moving to the other side of
6509: the room, where Fred having opened the piano, at his father’s desire,
6510: that Rosamond might give them some music, was parenthetically
6511: performing “Cherry Ripe!” with one hand. Able men who have passed their
6512: examinations will do these things sometimes, not less than the plucked
6513: Fred.
6514: 
6515: “Fred, pray defer your practising till to-morrow; you will make Mr.
6516: Lydgate ill,” said Rosamond. “He has an ear.”
6517: 
6518: Fred laughed, and went on with his tune to the end.
6519: 
6520: Rosamond turned to Lydgate, smiling gently, and said, “You perceive,
6521: the bears will not always be taught.”
6522: 
6523: “Now then, Rosy!” said Fred, springing from the stool and twisting it
6524: upward for her, with a hearty expectation of enjoyment. “Some good
6525: rousing tunes first.”
6526: 
6527: Rosamond played admirably. Her master at Mrs. Lemon’s school (close to
6528: a county town with a memorable history that had its relics in church
6529: and castle) was one of those excellent musicians here and there to be
6530: found in our provinces, worthy to compare with many a noted
6531: Kapellmeister in a country which offers more plentiful conditions of
6532: musical celebrity. Rosamond, with the executant’s instinct, had seized
6533: his manner of playing, and gave forth his large rendering of noble
6534: music with the precision of an echo. It was almost startling, heard for
6535: the first time. A hidden soul seemed to be flowing forth from
6536: Rosamond’s fingers; and so indeed it was, since souls live on in
6537: perpetual echoes, and to all fine expression there goes somewhere an
6538: originating activity, if it be only that of an interpreter. Lydgate was
6539: taken possession of, and began to believe in her as something
6540: exceptional. After all, he thought, one need not be surprised to find
6541: the rare conjunctions of nature under circumstances apparently
6542: unfavorable: come where they may, they always depend on conditions that
6543: are not obvious. He sat looking at her, and did not rise to pay her any
6544: compliments, leaving that to others, now that his admiration was
6545: deepened.
6546: 
6547: Her singing was less remarkable, but also well trained, and sweet to
6548: hear as a chime perfectly in tune. It is true she sang “Meet me by
6549: moonlight,” and “I’ve been roaming”; for mortals must share the
6550: fashions of their time, and none but the ancients can be always
6551: classical. But Rosamond could also sing “Black-eyed Susan” with effect,
6552: or Haydn’s canzonets, or “Voi, che sapete,” or “Batti, batti”—she only
6553: wanted to know what her audience liked.
6554: 
6555: Her father looked round at the company, delighting in their admiration.
6556: Her mother sat, like a Niobe before her troubles, with her youngest
6557: little girl on her lap, softly beating the child’s hand up and down in
6558: time to the music. And Fred, notwithstanding his general scepticism
6559: about Rosy, listened to her music with perfect allegiance, wishing he
6560: could do the same thing on his flute. It was the pleasantest family
6561: party that Lydgate had seen since he came to Middlemarch. The Vincys
6562: had the readiness to enjoy, the rejection of all anxiety, and the
6563: belief in life as a merry lot, which made a house exceptional in most
6564: county towns at that time, when Evangelicalism had cast a certain
6565: suspicion as of plague-infection over the few amusements which survived
6566: in the provinces. At the Vincys’ there was always whist, and the
6567: card-tables stood ready now, making some of the company secretly
6568: impatient of the music. Before it ceased Mr. Farebrother came in—a
6569: handsome, broad-chested but otherwise small man, about forty, whose
6570: black was very threadbare: the brilliancy was all in his quick gray
6571: eyes. He came like a pleasant change in the light, arresting little
6572: Louisa with fatherly nonsense as she was being led out of the room by
6573: Miss Morgan, greeting everybody with some special word, and seeming to
6574: condense more talk into ten minutes than had been held all through the
6575: evening. He claimed from Lydgate the fulfilment of a promise to come
6576: and see him. “I can’t let you off, you know, because I have some
6577: beetles to show you. We collectors feel an interest in every new man
6578: till he has seen all we have to show him.”
6579: 
6580: But soon he swerved to the whist-table, rubbing his hands and saying,
6581: “Come now, let us be serious! Mr. Lydgate? not play? Ah! you are too
6582: young and light for this kind of thing.”
6583: 
6584: Lydgate said to himself that the clergyman whose abilities were so
6585: painful to Mr. Bulstrode, appeared to have found an agreeable resort in
6586: this certainly not erudite household. He could half understand it: the
6587: good-humor, the good looks of elder and younger, and the provision for
6588: passing the time without any labor of intelligence, might make the
6589: house beguiling to people who had no particular use for their odd
6590: hours.
6591: 
6592: Everything looked blooming and joyous except Miss Morgan, who was
6593: brown, dull, and resigned, and altogether, as Mrs. Vincy often said,
6594: just the sort of person for a governess. Lydgate did not mean to pay
6595: many such visits himself. They were a wretched waste of the evenings;
6596: and now, when he had talked a little more to Rosamond, he meant to
6597: excuse himself and go.
6598: 
6599: “You will not like us at Middlemarch, I feel sure,” she said, when the
6600: whist-players were settled. “We are very stupid, and you have been used
6601: to something quite different.”
6602: 
6603: “I suppose all country towns are pretty much alike,” said Lydgate. “But
6604: I have noticed that one always believes one’s own town to be more
6605: stupid than any other. I have made up my mind to take Middlemarch as it
6606: comes, and shall be much obliged if the town will take me in the same
6607: way. I have certainly found some charms in it which are much greater
6608: than I had expected.”
6609: 
6610: “You mean the rides towards Tipton and Lowick; every one is pleased
6611: with those,” said Rosamond, with simplicity.
6612: 
6613: “No, I mean something much nearer to me.”
6614: 
6615: Rosamond rose and reached her netting, and then said, “Do you care
6616: about dancing at all? I am not quite sure whether clever men ever
6617: dance.”
6618: 
6619: “I would dance with you if you would allow me.”
6620: 
6621: “Oh!” said Rosamond, with a slight deprecatory laugh. “I was only going
6622: to say that we sometimes have dancing, and I wanted to know whether you
6623: would feel insulted if you were asked to come.”
6624: 
6625: “Not on the condition I mentioned.”
6626: 
6627: After this chat Lydgate thought that he was going, but on moving
6628: towards the whist-tables, he got interested in watching Mr.
6629: Farebrother’s play, which was masterly, and also his face, which was a
6630: striking mixture of the shrewd and the mild. At ten o’clock supper was
6631: brought in (such were the customs of Middlemarch) and there was
6632: punch-drinking; but Mr. Farebrother had only a glass of water. He was
6633: winning, but there seemed to be no reason why the renewal of rubbers
6634: should end, and Lydgate at last took his leave.
6635: 
6636: But as it was not eleven o’clock, he chose to walk in the brisk air
6637: towards the tower of St. Botolph’s, Mr. Farebrother’s church, which
6638: stood out dark, square, and massive against the starlight. It was the
6639: oldest church in Middlemarch; the living, however, was but a vicarage
6640: worth barely four hundred a-year. Lydgate had heard that, and he
6641: wondered now whether Mr. Farebrother cared about the money he won at
6642: cards; thinking, “He seems a very pleasant fellow, but Bulstrode may
6643: have his good reasons.” Many things would be easier to Lydgate if it
6644: should turn out that Mr. Bulstrode was generally justifiable. “What is
6645: his religious doctrine to me, if he carries some good notions along
6646: with it? One must use such brains as are to be found.”
6647: 
6648: These were actually Lydgate’s first meditations as he walked away from
6649: Mr. Vincy’s, and on this ground I fear that many ladies will consider
6650: him hardly worthy of their attention. He thought of Rosamond and her
6651: music only in the second place; and though, when her turn came, he
6652: dwelt on the image of her for the rest of his walk, he felt no
6653: agitation, and had no sense that any new current had set into his life.
6654: He could not marry yet; he wished not to marry for several years; and
6655: therefore he was not ready to entertain the notion of being in love
6656: with a girl whom he happened to admire. He did admire Rosamond
6657: exceedingly; but that madness which had once beset him about Laure was
6658: not, he thought, likely to recur in relation to any other woman.
6659: Certainly, if falling in love had been at all in question, it would
6660: have been quite safe with a creature like this Miss Vincy, who had just
6661: the kind of intelligence one would desire in a woman—polished, refined,
6662: docile, lending itself to finish in all the delicacies of life, and
6663: enshrined in a body which expressed this with a force of demonstration
6664: that excluded the need for other evidence. Lydgate felt sure that if
6665: ever he married, his wife would have that feminine radiance, that
6666: distinctive womanhood which must be classed with flowers and music,
6667: that sort of beauty which by its very nature was virtuous, being
6668: moulded only for pure and delicate joys.
6669: 
6670: But since he did not mean to marry for the next five years—his more
6671: pressing business was to look into Louis’ new book on Fever, which he
6672: was specially interested in, because he had known Louis in Paris, and
6673: had followed many anatomical demonstrations in order to ascertain the
6674: specific differences of typhus and typhoid. He went home and read far
6675: into the smallest hour, bringing a much more testing vision of details
6676: and relations into this pathological study than he had ever thought it
6677: necessary to apply to the complexities of love and marriage, these
6678: being subjects on which he felt himself amply informed by literature,
6679: and that traditional wisdom which is handed down in the genial
6680: conversation of men. Whereas Fever had obscure conditions, and gave him
6681: that delightful labor of the imagination which is not mere
6682: arbitrariness, but the exercise of disciplined power—combining and
6683: constructing with the clearest eye for probabilities and the fullest
6684: obedience to knowledge; and then, in yet more energetic alliance with
6685: impartial Nature, standing aloof to invent tests by which to try its
6686: own work.
6687: 
6688: Many men have been praised as vividly imaginative on the strength of
6689: their profuseness in indifferent drawing or cheap narration:—reports of
6690: very poor talk going on in distant orbs; or portraits of Lucifer coming
6691: down on his bad errands as a large ugly man with bat’s wings and spurts
6692: of phosphorescence; or exaggerations of wantonness that seem to reflect
6693: life in a diseased dream. But these kinds of inspiration Lydgate
6694: regarded as rather vulgar and vinous compared with the imagination that
6695: reveals subtle actions inaccessible by any sort of lens, but tracked in
6696: that outer darkness through long pathways of necessary sequence by the
6697: inward light which is the last refinement of Energy, capable of bathing
6698: even the ethereal atoms in its ideally illuminated space. He for his
6699: part had tossed away all cheap inventions where ignorance finds itself
6700: able and at ease: he was enamoured of that arduous invention which is
6701: the very eye of research, provisionally framing its object and
6702: correcting it to more and more exactness of relation; he wanted to
6703: pierce the obscurity of those minute processes which prepare human
6704: misery and joy, those invisible thoroughfares which are the first
6705: lurking-places of anguish, mania, and crime, that delicate poise and
6706: transition which determine the growth of happy or unhappy
6707: consciousness.
6708: 
6709: As he threw down his book, stretched his legs towards the embers in the
6710: grate, and clasped his hands at the back of his head, in that agreeable
6711: afterglow of excitement when thought lapses from examination of a
6712: specific object into a suffusive sense of its connections with all the
6713: rest of our existence—seems, as it were, to throw itself on its back
6714: after vigorous swimming and float with the repose of unexhausted
6715: strength—Lydgate felt a triumphant delight in his studies, and
6716: something like pity for those less lucky men who were not of his
6717: profession.
6718: 
6719: “If I had not taken that turn when I was a lad,” he thought, “I might
6720: have got into some stupid draught-horse work or other, and lived always
6721: in blinkers. I should never have been happy in any profession that did
6722: not call forth the highest intellectual strain, and yet keep me in good
6723: warm contact with my neighbors. There is nothing like the medical
6724: profession for that: one can have the exclusive scientific life that
6725: touches the distance and befriend the old fogies in the parish too. It
6726: is rather harder for a clergyman: Farebrother seems to be an anomaly.”
6727: 
6728: This last thought brought back the Vincys and all the pictures of the
6729: evening. They floated in his mind agreeably enough, and as he took up
6730: his bed-candle his lips were curled with that incipient smile which is
6731: apt to accompany agreeable recollections. He was an ardent fellow, but
6732: at present his ardor was absorbed in love of his work and in the
6733: ambition of making his life recognized as a factor in the better life
6734: of mankind—like other heroes of science who had nothing but an obscure
6735: country practice to begin with.
6736: 
6737: Poor Lydgate! or shall I say, Poor Rosamond! Each lived in a world of
6738: which the other knew nothing. It had not occurred to Lydgate that he
6739: had been a subject of eager meditation to Rosamond, who had neither any
6740: reason for throwing her marriage into distant perspective, nor any
6741: pathological studies to divert her mind from that ruminating habit,
6742: that inward repetition of looks, words, and phrases, which makes a
6743: large part in the lives of most girls. He had not meant to look at her
6744: or speak to her with more than the inevitable amount of admiration and
6745: compliment which a man must give to a beautiful girl; indeed, it seemed
6746: to him that his enjoyment of her music had remained almost silent, for
6747: he feared falling into the rudeness of telling her his great surprise
6748: at her possession of such accomplishment. But Rosamond had registered
6749: every look and word, and estimated them as the opening incidents of a
6750: preconceived romance—incidents which gather value from the foreseen
6751: development and climax. In Rosamond’s romance it was not necessary to
6752: imagine much about the inward life of the hero, or of his serious
6753: business in the world: of course, he had a profession and was clever,
6754: as well as sufficiently handsome; but the piquant fact about Lydgate
6755: was his good birth, which distinguished him from all Middlemarch
6756: admirers, and presented marriage as a prospect of rising in rank and
6757: getting a little nearer to that celestial condition on earth in which
6758: she would have nothing to do with vulgar people, and perhaps at last
6759: associate with relatives quite equal to the county people who looked
6760: down on the Middlemarchers. It was part of Rosamond’s cleverness to
6761: discern very subtly the faintest aroma of rank, and once when she had
6762: seen the Miss Brookes accompanying their uncle at the county assizes,
6763: and seated among the aristocracy, she had envied them, notwithstanding
6764: their plain dress.
6765: 
6766: If you think it incredible that to imagine Lydgate as a man of family
6767: could cause thrills of satisfaction which had anything to do with the
6768: sense that she was in love with him, I will ask you to use your power
6769: of comparison a little more effectively, and consider whether red cloth
6770: and epaulets have never had an influence of that sort. Our passions do
6771: not live apart in locked chambers, but, dressed in their small wardrobe
6772: of notions, bring their provisions to a common table and mess together,
6773: feeding out of the common store according to their appetite.
6774: 
6775: Rosamond, in fact, was entirely occupied not exactly with Tertius
6776: Lydgate as he was in himself, but with his relation to her; and it was
6777: excusable in a girl who was accustomed to hear that all young men
6778: might, could, would be, or actually were in love with her, to believe
6779: at once that Lydgate could be no exception. His looks and words meant
6780: more to her than other men’s, because she cared more for them: she
6781: thought of them diligently, and diligently attended to that perfection
6782: of appearance, behavior, sentiments, and all other elegancies, which
6783: would find in Lydgate a more adequate admirer than she had yet been
6784: conscious of.
6785: 
6786: For Rosamond, though she would never do anything that was disagreeable
6787: to her, was industrious; and now more than ever she was active in
6788: sketching her landscapes and market-carts and portraits of friends, in
6789: practising her music, and in being from morning till night her own
6790: standard of a perfect lady, having always an audience in her own
6791: consciousness, with sometimes the not unwelcome addition of a more
6792: variable external audience in the numerous visitors of the house. She
6793: found time also to read the best novels, and even the second best, and
6794: she knew much poetry by heart. Her favorite poem was “Lalla Rookh.”
6795: 
6796: “The best girl in the world! He will be a happy fellow who gets her!”
6797: was the sentiment of the elderly gentlemen who visited the Vincys; and
6798: the rejected young men thought of trying again, as is the fashion in
6799: country towns where the horizon is not thick with coming rivals. But
6800: Mrs. Plymdale thought that Rosamond had been educated to a ridiculous
6801: pitch, for what was the use of accomplishments which would be all laid
6802: aside as soon as she was married? While her aunt Bulstrode, who had a
6803: sisterly faithfulness towards her brother’s family, had two sincere
6804: wishes for Rosamond—that she might show a more serious turn of mind,
6805: and that she might meet with a husband whose wealth corresponded to her
6806: habits.
6807:

6810: 
6811: CHAPTER XVII.
6812: 
6813: “The clerkly person smiled and said
6814: Promise was a pretty maid,
6815: But being poor she died unwed.”
6816: 
6817: 
6818: The Rev. Camden Farebrother, whom Lydgate went to see the next evening,
6819: lived in an old parsonage, built of stone, venerable enough to match
6820: the church which it looked out upon. All the furniture too in the house
6821: was old, but with another grade of age—that of Mr. Farebrother’s father
6822: and grandfather. There were painted white chairs, with gilding and
6823: wreaths on them, and some lingering red silk damask with slits in it.
6824: There were engraved portraits of Lord Chancellors and other celebrated
6825: lawyers of the last century; and there were old pier-glasses to reflect
6826: them, as well as the little satin-wood tables and the sofas resembling
6827: a prolongation of uneasy chairs, all standing in relief against the
6828: dark wainscot. This was the physiognomy of the drawing-room into which
6829: Lydgate was shown; and there were three ladies to receive him, who were
6830: also old-fashioned, and of a faded but genuine respectability: Mrs.
6831: Farebrother, the Vicar’s white-haired mother, befrilled and kerchiefed
6832: with dainty cleanliness, upright, quick-eyed, and still under seventy;
6833: Miss Noble, her sister, a tiny old lady of meeker aspect, with frills
6834: and kerchief decidedly more worn and mended; and Miss Winifred
6835: Farebrother, the Vicar’s elder sister, well-looking like himself, but
6836: nipped and subdued as single women are apt to be who spend their lives
6837: in uninterrupted subjection to their elders. Lydgate had not expected
6838: to see so quaint a group: knowing simply that Mr. Farebrother was a
6839: bachelor, he had thought of being ushered into a snuggery where the
6840: chief furniture would probably be books and collections of natural
6841: objects. The Vicar himself seemed to wear rather a changed aspect, as
6842: most men do when acquaintances made elsewhere see them for the first
6843: time in their own homes; some indeed showing like an actor of genial
6844: parts disadvantageously cast for the curmudgeon in a new piece. This
6845: was not the case with Mr. Farebrother: he seemed a trifle milder and
6846: more silent, the chief talker being his mother, while he only put in a
6847: good-humored moderating remark here and there. The old lady was
6848: evidently accustomed to tell her company what they ought to think, and
6849: to regard no subject as quite safe without her steering. She was
6850: afforded leisure for this function by having all her little wants
6851: attended to by Miss Winifred. Meanwhile tiny Miss Noble carried on her
6852: arm a small basket, into which she diverted a bit of sugar, which she
6853: had first dropped in her saucer as if by mistake; looking round
6854: furtively afterwards, and reverting to her teacup with a small innocent
6855: noise as of a tiny timid quadruped. Pray think no ill of Miss Noble.
6856: That basket held small savings from her more portable food, destined
6857: for the children of her poor friends among whom she trotted on fine
6858: mornings; fostering and petting all needy creatures being so
6859: spontaneous a delight to her, that she regarded it much as if it had
6860: been a pleasant vice that she was addicted to. Perhaps she was
6861: conscious of being tempted to steal from those who had much that she
6862: might give to those who had nothing, and carried in her conscience the
6863: guilt of that repressed desire. One must be poor to know the luxury of
6864: giving!
6865: 
6866: Mrs. Farebrother welcomed the guest with a lively formality and
6867: precision. She presently informed him that they were not often in want
6868: of medical aid in that house. She had brought up her children to wear
6869: flannel and not to over-eat themselves, which last habit she considered
6870: the chief reason why people needed doctors. Lydgate pleaded for those
6871: whose fathers and mothers had over-eaten themselves, but Mrs.
6872: Farebrother held that view of things dangerous: Nature was more just
6873: than that; it would be easy for any felon to say that his ancestors
6874: ought to have been hanged instead of him. If those who had bad fathers
6875: and mothers were bad themselves, they were hanged for that. There was
6876: no need to go back on what you couldn’t see.
6877: 
6878: “My mother is like old George the Third,” said the Vicar, “she objects
6879: to metaphysics.”
6880: 
6881: “I object to what is wrong, Camden. I say, keep hold of a few plain
6882: truths, and make everything square with them. When I was young, Mr.
6883: Lydgate, there never was any question about right and wrong. We knew
6884: our catechism, and that was enough; we learned our creed and our duty.
6885: Every respectable Church person had the same opinions. But now, if you
6886: speak out of the Prayer-book itself, you are liable to be
6887: contradicted.”
6888: 
6889: “That makes rather a pleasant time of it for those who like to maintain
6890: their own point,” said Lydgate.
6891: 
6892: “But my mother always gives way,” said the Vicar, slyly.
6893: 
6894: “No, no, Camden, you must not lead Mr. Lydgate into a mistake about
6895: _me_. I shall never show that disrespect to my parents, to give up what
6896: they taught me. Any one may see what comes of turning. If you change
6897: once, why not twenty times?”
6898: 
6899: “A man might see good arguments for changing once, and not see them for
6900: changing again,” said Lydgate, amused with the decisive old lady.
6901: 
6902: “Excuse me there. If you go upon arguments, they are never wanting,
6903: when a man has no constancy of mind. My father never changed, and he
6904: preached plain moral sermons without arguments, and was a good man—few
6905: better. When you get me a good man made out of arguments, I will get
6906: you a good dinner with reading you the cookery-book. That’s my opinion,
6907: and I think anybody’s stomach will bear me out.”
6908: 
6909: “About the dinner certainly, mother,” said Mr. Farebrother.
6910: 
6911: “It is the same thing, the dinner or the man. I am nearly seventy, Mr.
6912: Lydgate, and I go upon experience. I am not likely to follow new
6913: lights, though there are plenty of them here as elsewhere. I say, they
6914: came in with the mixed stuffs that will neither wash nor wear. It was
6915: not so in my youth: a Churchman was a Churchman, and a clergyman, you
6916: might be pretty sure, was a gentleman, if nothing else. But now he may
6917: be no better than a Dissenter, and want to push aside my son on
6918: pretence of doctrine. But whoever may wish to push him aside, I am
6919: proud to say, Mr. Lydgate, that he will compare with any preacher in
6920: this kingdom, not to speak of this town, which is but a low standard to
6921: go by; at least, to my thinking, for I was born and bred at Exeter.”
6922: 
6923: “A mother is never partial,” said Mr. Farebrother, smiling. “What do
6924: you think Tyke’s mother says about him?”
6925: 
6926: “Ah, poor creature! what indeed?” said Mrs. Farebrother, her sharpness
6927: blunted for the moment by her confidence in maternal judgments. “She
6928: says the truth to herself, depend upon it.”
6929: 
6930: “And what is the truth?” said Lydgate. “I am curious to know.”
6931: 
6932: “Oh, nothing bad at all,” said Mr. Farebrother. “He is a zealous
6933: fellow: not very learned, and not very wise, I think—because I don’t
6934: agree with him.”
6935: 
6936: “Why, Camden!” said Miss Winifred, “Griffin and his wife told me only
6937: to-day, that Mr. Tyke said they should have no more coals if they came
6938: to hear you preach.”
6939: 
6940: Mrs. Farebrother laid down her knitting, which she had resumed after
6941: her small allowance of tea and toast, and looked at her son as if to
6942: say “You hear that?” Miss Noble said, “Oh poor things! poor things!” in
6943: reference, probably, to the double loss of preaching and coal. But the
6944: Vicar answered quietly—
6945: 
6946: “That is because they are not my parishioners. And I don’t think my
6947: sermons are worth a load of coals to them.”
6948: 
6949: “Mr. Lydgate,” said Mrs. Farebrother, who could not let this pass, “you
6950: don’t know my son: he always undervalues himself. I tell him he is
6951: undervaluing the God who made him, and made him a most excellent
6952: preacher.”
6953: 
6954: “That must be a hint for me to take Mr. Lydgate away to my study,
6955: mother,” said the Vicar, laughing. “I promised to show you my
6956: collection,” he added, turning to Lydgate; “shall we go?”
6957: 
6958: All three ladies remonstrated. Mr. Lydgate ought not to be hurried away
6959: without being allowed to accept another cup of tea: Miss Winifred had
6960: abundance of good tea in the pot. Why was Camden in such haste to take
6961: a visitor to his den? There was nothing but pickled vermin, and drawers
6962: full of blue-bottles and moths, with no carpet on the floor. Mr.
6963: Lydgate must excuse it. A game at cribbage would be far better. In
6964: short, it was plain that a vicar might be adored by his womankind as
6965: the king of men and preachers, and yet be held by them to stand in much
6966: need of their direction. Lydgate, with the usual shallowness of a young
6967: bachelor, wondered that Mr. Farebrother had not taught them better.
6968: 
6969: “My mother is not used to my having visitors who can take any interest
6970: in my hobbies,” said the Vicar, as he opened the door of his study,
6971: which was indeed as bare of luxuries for the body as the ladies had
6972: implied, unless a short porcelain pipe and a tobacco-box were to be
6973: excepted.
6974: 
6975: “Men of your profession don’t generally smoke,” he said. Lydgate smiled
6976: and shook his head. “Nor of mine either, properly, I suppose. You will
6977: hear that pipe alleged against me by Bulstrode and Company. They don’t
6978: know how pleased the devil would be if I gave it up.”
6979: 
6980: “I understand. You are of an excitable temper and want a sedative. I am
6981: heavier, and should get idle with it. I should rush into idleness, and
6982: stagnate there with all my might.”
6983: 
6984: “And you mean to give it all to your work. I am some ten or twelve
6985: years older than you, and have come to a compromise. I feed a weakness
6986: or two lest they should get clamorous. See,” continued the Vicar,
6987: opening several small drawers, “I fancy I have made an exhaustive study
6988: of the entomology of this district. I am going on both with the fauna
6989: and flora; but I have at least done my insects well. We are singularly
6990: rich in orthoptera: I don’t know whether—Ah! you have got hold of that
6991: glass jar—you are looking into that instead of my drawers. You don’t
6992: really care about these things?”
6993: 
6994: “Not by the side of this lovely anencephalous monster. I have never had
6995: time to give myself much to natural history. I was early bitten with an
6996: interest in structure, and it is what lies most directly in my
6997: profession. I have no hobby besides. I have the sea to swim in there.”
6998: 
6999: “Ah! you are a happy fellow,” said Mr. Farebrother, turning on his heel
7000: and beginning to fill his pipe. “You don’t know what it is to want
7001: spiritual tobacco—bad emendations of old texts, or small items about a
7002: variety of Aphis Brassicae, with the well-known signature of
7003: Philomicron, for the ‘Twaddler’s Magazine;’ or a learned treatise on
7004: the entomology of the Pentateuch, including all the insects not
7005: mentioned, but probably met with by the Israelites in their passage
7006: through the desert; with a monograph on the Ant, as treated by Solomon,
7007: showing the harmony of the Book of Proverbs with the results of modern
7008: research. You don’t mind my fumigating you?”
7009: 
7010: Lydgate was more surprised at the openness of this talk than at its
7011: implied meaning—that the Vicar felt himself not altogether in the right
7012: vocation. The neat fitting-up of drawers and shelves, and the bookcase
7013: filled with expensive illustrated books on Natural History, made him
7014: think again of the winnings at cards and their destination. But he was
7015: beginning to wish that the very best construction of everything that
7016: Mr. Farebrother did should be the true one. The Vicar’s frankness
7017: seemed not of the repulsive sort that comes from an uneasy
7018: consciousness seeking to forestall the judgment of others, but simply
7019: the relief of a desire to do with as little pretence as possible.
7020: Apparently he was not without a sense that his freedom of speech might
7021: seem premature, for he presently said—
7022: 
7023: “I have not yet told you that I have the advantage of you, Mr. Lydgate,
7024: and know you better than you know me. You remember Trawley who shared
7025: your apartment at Paris for some time? I was a correspondent of his,
7026: and he told me a good deal about you. I was not quite sure when you
7027: first came that you were the same man. I was very glad when I found
7028: that you were. Only I don’t forget that you have not had the like
7029: prologue about me.”
7030: 
7031: Lydgate divined some delicacy of feeling here, but did not half
7032: understand it. “By the way,” he said, “what has become of Trawley? I
7033: have quite lost sight of him. He was hot on the French social systems,
7034: and talked of going to the Backwoods to found a sort of Pythagorean
7035: community. Is he gone?”
7036: 
7037: “Not at all. He is practising at a German bath, and has married a rich
7038: patient.”
7039: 
7040: “Then my notions wear the best, so far,” said Lydgate, with a short
7041: scornful laugh. “He would have it, the medical profession was an
7042: inevitable system of humbug. I said, the fault was in the men—men who
7043: truckle to lies and folly. Instead of preaching against humbug outside
7044: the walls, it might be better to set up a disinfecting apparatus
7045: within. In short—I am reporting my own conversation—you may be sure I
7046: had all the good sense on my side.”
7047: 
7048: “Your scheme is a good deal more difficult to carry out than the
7049: Pythagorean community, though. You have not only got the old Adam in
7050: yourself against you, but you have got all those descendants of the
7051: original Adam who form the society around you. You see, I have paid
7052: twelve or thirteen years more than you for my knowledge of
7053: difficulties. But”—Mr. Farebrother broke off a moment, and then added,
7054: “you are eying that glass vase again. Do you want to make an exchange?
7055: You shall not have it without a fair barter.”
7056: 
7057: “I have some sea-mice—fine specimens—in spirits. And I will throw in
7058: Robert Brown’s new thing—‘Microscopic Observations on the Pollen of
7059: Plants’—if you don’t happen to have it already.”
7060: 
7061: “Why, seeing how you long for the monster, I might ask a higher price.
7062: Suppose I ask you to look through my drawers and agree with me about
7063: all my new species?” The Vicar, while he talked in this way,
7064: alternately moved about with his pipe in his mouth, and returned to
7065: hang rather fondly over his drawers. “That would be good discipline,
7066: you know, for a young doctor who has to please his patients in
7067: Middlemarch. You must learn to be bored, remember. However, you shall
7068: have the monster on your own terms.”
7069: 
7070: “Don’t you think men overrate the necessity for humoring everybody’s
7071: nonsense, till they get despised by the very fools they humor?” said
7072: Lydgate, moving to Mr. Farebrother’s side, and looking rather absently
7073: at the insects ranged in fine gradation, with names subscribed in
7074: exquisite writing. “The shortest way is to make your value felt, so
7075: that people must put up with you whether you flatter them or not.”
7076: 
7077: “With all my heart. But then you must be sure of having the value, and
7078: you must keep yourself independent. Very few men can do that. Either
7079: you slip out of service altogether, and become good for nothing, or you
7080: wear the harness and draw a good deal where your yoke-fellows pull you.
7081: But do look at these delicate orthoptera!”
7082: 
7083: Lydgate had after all to give some scrutiny to each drawer, the Vicar
7084: laughing at himself, and yet persisting in the exhibition.
7085: 
7086: “Apropos of what you said about wearing harness,” Lydgate began, after
7087: they had sat down, “I made up my mind some time ago to do with as
7088: little of it as possible. That was why I determined not to try anything
7089: in London, for a good many years at least. I didn’t like what I saw
7090: when I was studying there—so much empty bigwiggism, and obstructive
7091: trickery. In the country, people have less pretension to knowledge, and
7092: are less of companions, but for that reason they affect one’s
7093: amour-propre less: one makes less bad blood, and can follow one’s own
7094: course more quietly.”
7095: 
7096: “Yes—well—you have got a good start; you are in the right profession,
7097: the work you feel yourself most fit for. Some people miss that, and
7098: repent too late. But you must not be too sure of keeping your
7099: independence.”
7100: 
7101: “You mean of family ties?” said Lydgate, conceiving that these might
7102: press rather tightly on Mr. Farebrother.
7103: 
7104: “Not altogether. Of course they make many things more difficult. But a
7105: good wife—a good unworldly woman—may really help a man, and keep him
7106: more independent. There’s a parishioner of mine—a fine fellow, but who
7107: would hardly have pulled through as he has done without his wife. Do
7108: you know the Garths? I think they were not Peacock’s patients.”
7109: 
7110: “No; but there is a Miss Garth at old Featherstone’s, at Lowick.”
7111: 
7112: “Their daughter: an excellent girl.”
7113: 
7114: “She is very quiet—I have hardly noticed her.”
7115: 
7116: “She has taken notice of you, though, depend upon it.”
7117: 
7118: “I don’t understand,” said Lydgate; he could hardly say “Of course.”
7119: 
7120: “Oh, she gauges everybody. I prepared her for confirmation—she is a
7121: favorite of mine.”
7122: 
7123: Mr. Farebrother puffed a few moments in silence, Lydgate not caring to
7124: know more about the Garths. At last the Vicar laid down his pipe,
7125: stretched out his legs, and turned his bright eyes with a smile towards
7126: Lydgate, saying—
7127: 
7128: “But we Middlemarchers are not so tame as you take us to be. We have
7129: our intrigues and our parties. I am a party man, for example, and
7130: Bulstrode is another. If you vote for me you will offend Bulstrode.”
7131: 
7132: “What is there against Bulstrode?” said Lydgate, emphatically.
7133: 
7134: “I did not say there was anything against him except that. If you vote
7135: against him you will make him your enemy.”
7136: 
7137: “I don’t know that I need mind about that,” said Lydgate, rather
7138: proudly; “but he seems to have good ideas about hospitals, and he
7139: spends large sums on useful public objects. He might help me a good
7140: deal in carrying out my ideas. As to his religious notions—why, as
7141: Voltaire said, incantations will destroy a flock of sheep if
7142: administered with a certain quantity of arsenic. I look for the man who
7143: will bring the arsenic, and don’t mind about his incantations.”
7144: 
7145: “Very good. But then you must not offend your arsenic-man. You will not
7146: offend me, you know,” said Mr. Farebrother, quite unaffectedly. “I
7147: don’t translate my own convenience into other people’s duties. I am
7148: opposed to Bulstrode in many ways. I don’t like the set he belongs to:
7149: they are a narrow ignorant set, and do more to make their neighbors
7150: uncomfortable than to make them better. Their system is a sort of
7151: worldly-spiritual cliqueism: they really look on the rest of mankind as
7152: a doomed carcass which is to nourish them for heaven. But,” he added,
7153: smilingly, “I don’t say that Bulstrode’s new hospital is a bad thing;
7154: and as to his wanting to oust me from the old one—why, if he thinks me
7155: a mischievous fellow, he is only returning a compliment. And I am not a
7156: model clergyman—only a decent makeshift.”
7157: 
7158: Lydgate was not at all sure that the Vicar maligned himself. A model
7159: clergyman, like a model doctor, ought to think his own profession the
7160: finest in the world, and take all knowledge as mere nourishment to his
7161: moral pathology and therapeutics. He only said, “What reason does
7162: Bulstrode give for superseding you?”
7163: 
7164: “That I don’t teach his opinions—which he calls spiritual religion; and
7165: that I have no time to spare. Both statements are true. But then I
7166: could make time, and I should be glad of the forty pounds. That is the
7167: plain fact of the case. But let us dismiss it. I only wanted to tell
7168: you that if you vote for your arsenic-man, you are not to cut me in
7169: consequence. I can’t spare you. You are a sort of circumnavigator come
7170: to settle among us, and will keep up my belief in the antipodes. Now
7171: tell me all about them in Paris.”
7172: 
7173: 
7174: 
7175: 
7176: CHAPTER XVIII.
7177: 
7178: “Oh, sir, the loftiest hopes on earth
7179: Draw lots with meaner hopes: heroic breasts,
7180: Breathing bad air, run risk of pestilence;
7181: Or, lacking lime-juice when they cross the Line,
7182: May languish with the scurvy.”
7183: 
7184: 
7185: Some weeks passed after this conversation before the question of the
7186: chaplaincy gathered any practical import for Lydgate, and without
7187: telling himself the reason, he deferred the predetermination on which
7188: side he should give his vote. It would really have been a matter of
7189: total indifference to him—that is to say, he would have taken the more
7190: convenient side, and given his vote for the appointment of Tyke without
7191: any hesitation—if he had not cared personally for Mr. Farebrother.
7192: 
7193: But his liking for the Vicar of St. Botolph’s grew with growing
7194: acquaintanceship. That, entering into Lydgate’s position as a new-comer
7195: who had his own professional objects to secure, Mr. Farebrother should
7196: have taken pains rather to warn off than to obtain his interest, showed
7197: an unusual delicacy and generosity, which Lydgate’s nature was keenly
7198: alive to. It went along with other points of conduct in Mr. Farebrother
7199: which were exceptionally fine, and made his character resemble those
7200: southern landscapes which seem divided between natural grandeur and
7201: social slovenliness. Very few men could have been as filial and
7202: chivalrous as he was to the mother, aunt, and sister, whose dependence
7203: on him had in many ways shaped his life rather uneasily for himself;
7204: few men who feel the pressure of small needs are so nobly resolute not
7205: to dress up their inevitably self-interested desires in a pretext of
7206: better motives. In these matters he was conscious that his life would
7207: bear the closest scrutiny; and perhaps the consciousness encouraged a
7208: little defiance towards the critical strictness of persons whose
7209: celestial intimacies seemed not to improve their domestic manners, and
7210: whose lofty aims were not needed to account for their actions. Then,
7211: his preaching was ingenious and pithy, like the preaching of the
7212: English Church in its robust age, and his sermons were delivered
7213: without book. People outside his parish went to hear him; and, since to
7214: fill the church was always the most difficult part of a clergyman’s
7215: function, here was another ground for a careless sense of superiority.
7216: Besides, he was a likable man: sweet-tempered, ready-witted, frank,
7217: without grins of suppressed bitterness or other conversational flavors
7218: which make half of us an affliction to our friends. Lydgate liked him
7219: heartily, and wished for his friendship.
7220: 
7221: With this feeling uppermost, he continued to waive the question of the
7222: chaplaincy, and to persuade himself that it was not only no proper
7223: business of his, but likely enough never to vex him with a demand for
7224: his vote. Lydgate, at Mr. Bulstrode’s request, was laying down plans
7225: for the internal arrangements of the new hospital, and the two were
7226: often in consultation. The banker was always presupposing that he could
7227: count in general on Lydgate as a coadjutor, but made no special
7228: recurrence to the coming decision between Tyke and Farebrother. When
7229: the General Board of the Infirmary had met, however, and Lydgate had
7230: notice that the question of the chaplaincy was thrown on a council of
7231: the directors and medical men, to meet on the following Friday, he had
7232: a vexed sense that he must make up his mind on this trivial Middlemarch
7233: business. He could not help hearing within him the distinct declaration
7234: that Bulstrode was prime minister, and that the Tyke affair was a
7235: question of office or no office; and he could not help an equally
7236: pronounced dislike to giving up the prospect of office. For his
7237: observation was constantly confirming Mr. Farebrother’s assurance that
7238: the banker would not overlook opposition. “Confound their petty
7239: politics!” was one of his thoughts for three mornings in the meditative
7240: process of shaving, when he had begun to feel that he must really hold
7241: a court of conscience on this matter. Certainly there were valid things
7242: to be said against the election of Mr. Farebrother: he had too much on
7243: his hands already, especially considering how much time he spent on
7244: non-clerical occupations. Then again it was a continually repeated
7245: shock, disturbing Lydgate’s esteem, that the Vicar should obviously
7246: play for the sake of money, liking the play indeed, but evidently
7247: liking some end which it served. Mr. Farebrother contended on theory
7248: for the desirability of all games, and said that Englishmen’s wit was
7249: stagnant for want of them; but Lydgate felt certain that he would have
7250: played very much less but for the money. There was a billiard-room at
7251: the Green Dragon, which some anxious mothers and wives regarded as the
7252: chief temptation in Middlemarch. The Vicar was a first-rate
7253: billiard-player, and though he did not frequent the Green Dragon, there
7254: were reports that he had sometimes been there in the daytime and had
7255: won money. And as to the chaplaincy, he did not pretend that he cared
7256: for it, except for the sake of the forty pounds. Lydgate was no
7257: Puritan, but he did not care for play, and winning money at it had
7258: always seemed a meanness to him; besides, he had an ideal of life which
7259: made this subservience of conduct to the gaining of small sums
7260: thoroughly hateful to him. Hitherto in his own life his wants had been
7261: supplied without any trouble to himself, and his first impulse was
7262: always to be liberal with half-crowns as matters of no importance to a
7263: gentleman; it had never occurred to him to devise a plan for getting
7264: half-crowns. He had always known in a general way that he was not rich,
7265: but he had never felt poor, and he had no power of imagining the part
7266: which the want of money plays in determining the actions of men. Money
7267: had never been a motive to him. Hence he was not ready to frame excuses
7268: for this deliberate pursuit of small gains. It was altogether repulsive
7269: to him, and he never entered into any calculation of the ratio between
7270: the Vicar’s income and his more or less necessary expenditure. It was
7271: possible that he would not have made such a calculation in his own
7272: case.
7273: 
7274: And now, when the question of voting had come, this repulsive fact told
7275: more strongly against Mr. Farebrother than it had done before. One
7276: would know much better what to do if men’s characters were more
7277: consistent, and especially if one’s friends were invariably fit for any
7278: function they desired to undertake! Lydgate was convinced that if there
7279: had been no valid objection to Mr. Farebrother, he would have voted for
7280: him, whatever Bulstrode might have felt on the subject: he did not
7281: intend to be a vassal of Bulstrode’s. On the other hand, there was
7282: Tyke, a man entirely given to his clerical office, who was simply
7283: curate at a chapel of ease in St. Peter’s parish, and had time for
7284: extra duty. Nobody had anything to say against Mr. Tyke, except that
7285: they could not bear him, and suspected him of cant. Really, from his
7286: point of view, Bulstrode was thoroughly justified.
7287: 
7288: But whichever way Lydgate began to incline, there was something to make
7289: him wince; and being a proud man, he was a little exasperated at being
7290: obliged to wince. He did not like frustrating his own best purposes by
7291: getting on bad terms with Bulstrode; he did not like voting against
7292: Farebrother, and helping to deprive him of function and salary; and the
7293: question occurred whether the additional forty pounds might not leave
7294: the Vicar free from that ignoble care about winning at cards. Moreover,
7295: Lydgate did not like the consciousness that in voting for Tyke he
7296: should be voting on the side obviously convenient for himself. But
7297: would the end really be his own convenience? Other people would say so,
7298: and would allege that he was currying favor with Bulstrode for the sake
7299: of making himself important and getting on in the world. What then? He
7300: for his own part knew that if his personal prospects simply had been
7301: concerned, he would not have cared a rotten nut for the banker’s
7302: friendship or enmity. What he really cared for was a medium for his
7303: work, a vehicle for his ideas; and after all, was he not bound to
7304: prefer the object of getting a good hospital, where he could
7305: demonstrate the specific distinctions of fever and test therapeutic
7306: results, before anything else connected with this chaplaincy? For the
7307: first time Lydgate was feeling the hampering threadlike pressure of
7308: small social conditions, and their frustrating complexity. At the end
7309: of his inward debate, when he set out for the hospital, his hope was
7310: really in the chance that discussion might somehow give a new aspect to
7311: the question, and make the scale dip so as to exclude the necessity for
7312: voting. I think he trusted a little also to the energy which is
7313: begotten by circumstances—some feeling rushing warmly and making
7314: resolve easy, while debate in cool blood had only made it more
7315: difficult. However it was, he did not distinctly say to himself on
7316: which side he would vote; and all the while he was inwardly resenting
7317: the subjection which had been forced upon him. It would have seemed
7318: beforehand like a ridiculous piece of bad logic that he, with his
7319: unmixed resolutions of independence and his select purposes, would find
7320: himself at the very outset in the grasp of petty alternatives, each of
7321: which was repugnant to him. In his student’s chambers, he had
7322: prearranged his social action quite differently.
7323: 
7324: Lydgate was late in setting out, but Dr. Sprague, the two other
7325: surgeons, and several of the directors had arrived early; Mr.
7326: Bulstrode, treasurer and chairman, being among those who were still
7327: absent. The conversation seemed to imply that the issue was
7328: problematical, and that a majority for Tyke was not so certain as had
7329: been generally supposed. The two physicians, for a wonder, turned out
7330: to be unanimous, or rather, though of different minds, they concurred
7331: in action. Dr. Sprague, the rugged and weighty, was, as every one had
7332: foreseen, an adherent of Mr. Farebrother. The Doctor was more than
7333: suspected of having no religion, but somehow Middlemarch tolerated this
7334: deficiency in him as if he had been a Lord Chancellor; indeed it is
7335: probable that his professional weight was the more believed in, the
7336: world-old association of cleverness with the evil principle being still
7337: potent in the minds even of lady-patients who had the strictest ideas
7338: of frilling and sentiment. It was perhaps this negation in the Doctor
7339: which made his neighbors call him hard-headed and dry-witted;
7340: conditions of texture which were also held favorable to the storing of
7341: judgments connected with drugs. At all events, it is certain that if
7342: any medical man had come to Middlemarch with the reputation of having
7343: very definite religious views, of being given to prayer, and of
7344: otherwise showing an active piety, there would have been a general
7345: presumption against his medical skill.
7346: 
7347: On this ground it was (professionally speaking) fortunate for Dr.
7348: Minchin that his religious sympathies were of a general kind, and such
7349: as gave a distant medical sanction to all serious sentiment, whether of
7350: Church or Dissent, rather than any adhesion to particular tenets. If
7351: Mr. Bulstrode insisted, as he was apt to do, on the Lutheran doctrine
7352: of justification, as that by which a Church must stand or fall, Dr.
7353: Minchin in return was quite sure that man was not a mere machine or a
7354: fortuitous conjunction of atoms; if Mrs. Wimple insisted on a
7355: particular providence in relation to her stomach complaint, Dr. Minchin
7356: for his part liked to keep the mental windows open and objected to
7357: fixed limits; if the Unitarian brewer jested about the Athanasian
7358: Creed, Dr. Minchin quoted Pope’s “Essay on Man.” He objected to the
7359: rather free style of anecdote in which Dr. Sprague indulged, preferring
7360: well-sanctioned quotations, and liking refinement of all kinds: it was
7361: generally known that he had some kinship to a bishop, and sometimes
7362: spent his holidays at “the palace.”
7363: 
7364: Dr. Minchin was soft-handed, pale-complexioned, and of rounded outline,
7365: not to be distinguished from a mild clergyman in appearance: whereas
7366: Dr. Sprague was superfluously tall; his trousers got creased at the
7367: knees, and showed an excess of boot at a time when straps seemed
7368: necessary to any dignity of bearing; you heard him go in and out, and
7369: up and down, as if he had come to see after the roofing. In short, he
7370: had weight, and might be expected to grapple with a disease and throw
7371: it; while Dr. Minchin might be better able to detect it lurking and to
7372: circumvent it. They enjoyed about equally the mysterious privilege of
7373: medical reputation, and concealed with much etiquette their contempt
7374: for each other’s skill. Regarding themselves as Middlemarch
7375: institutions, they were ready to combine against all innovators, and
7376: against non-professionals given to interference. On this ground they
7377: were both in their hearts equally averse to Mr. Bulstrode, though Dr.
7378: Minchin had never been in open hostility with him, and never differed
7379: from him without elaborate explanation to Mrs. Bulstrode, who had found
7380: that Dr. Minchin alone understood her constitution. A layman who pried
7381: into the professional conduct of medical men, and was always obtruding
7382: his reforms,—though he was less directly embarrassing to the two
7383: physicians than to the surgeon-apothecaries who attended paupers by
7384: contract, was nevertheless offensive to the professional nostril as
7385: such; and Dr. Minchin shared fully in the new pique against Bulstrode,
7386: excited by his apparent determination to patronize Lydgate. The
7387: long-established practitioners, Mr. Wrench and Mr. Toller; were just
7388: now standing apart and having a friendly colloquy, in which they agreed
7389: that Lydgate was a jackanapes, just made to serve Bulstrode’s purpose.
7390: To non-medical friends they had already concurred in praising the other
7391: young practitioner, who had come into the town on Mr. Peacock’s
7392: retirement without further recommendation than his own merits and such
7393: argument for solid professional acquirement as might be gathered from
7394: his having apparently wasted no time on other branches of knowledge. It
7395: was clear that Lydgate, by not dispensing drugs, intended to cast
7396: imputations on his equals, and also to obscure the limit between his
7397: own rank as a general practitioner and that of the physicians, who, in
7398: the interest of the profession, felt bound to maintain its various
7399: grades,—especially against a man who had not been to either of the
7400: English universities and enjoyed the absence of anatomical and bedside
7401: study there, but came with a libellous pretension to experience in
7402: Edinburgh and Paris, where observation might be abundant indeed, but
7403: hardly sound.
7404: 
7405: Thus it happened that on this occasion Bulstrode became identified with
7406: Lydgate, and Lydgate with Tyke; and owing to this variety of
7407: interchangeable names for the chaplaincy question, diverse minds were
7408: enabled to form the same judgment concerning it.
7409: 
7410: Dr. Sprague said at once bluntly to the group assembled when he
7411: entered, “I go for Farebrother. A salary, with all my heart. But why
7412: take it from the Vicar? He has none too much—has to insure his life,
7413: besides keeping house, and doing a vicar’s charities. Put forty pounds
7414: in his pocket and you’ll do no harm. He’s a good fellow, is
7415: Farebrother, with as little of the parson about him as will serve to
7416: carry orders.”
7417: 
7418: “Ho, ho! Doctor,” said old Mr. Powderell, a retired iron-monger of some
7419: standing—his interjection being something between a laugh and a
7420: Parliamentary disapproval; “we must let you have your say. But what we
7421: have to consider is not anybody’s income—it’s the souls of the poor
7422: sick people”—here Mr. Powderell’s voice and face had a sincere pathos
7423: in them. “He is a real Gospel preacher, is Mr. Tyke. I should vote
7424: against my conscience if I voted against Mr. Tyke—I should indeed.”
7425: 
7426: “Mr. Tyke’s opponents have not asked any one to vote against his
7427: conscience, I believe,” said Mr. Hackbutt, a rich tanner of fluent
7428: speech, whose glittering spectacles and erect hair were turned with
7429: some severity towards innocent Mr. Powderell. “But in my judgment it
7430: behoves us, as Directors, to consider whether we will regard it as our
7431: whole business to carry out propositions emanating from a single
7432: quarter. Will any member of the committee aver that he would have
7433: entertained the idea of displacing the gentleman who has always
7434: discharged the function of chaplain here, if it had not been suggested
7435: to him by parties whose disposition it is to regard every institution
7436: of this town as a machinery for carrying out their own views? I tax no
7437: man’s motives: let them lie between himself and a higher Power; but I
7438: do say, that there are influences at work here which are incompatible
7439: with genuine independence, and that a crawling servility is usually
7440: dictated by circumstances which gentlemen so conducting themselves
7441: could not afford either morally or financially to avow. I myself am a
7442: layman, but I have given no inconsiderable attention to the divisions
7443: in the Church and—”
7444: 
7445: “Oh, damn the divisions!” burst in Mr. Frank Hawley, lawyer and
7446: town-clerk, who rarely presented himself at the board, but now looked
7447: in hurriedly, whip in hand. “We have nothing to do with them here.
7448: Farebrother has been doing the work—what there was—without pay, and if
7449: pay is to be given, it should be given to him. I call it a confounded
7450: job to take the thing away from Farebrother.”
7451: 
7452: “I think it would be as well for gentlemen not to give their remarks a
7453: personal bearing,” said Mr. Plymdale. “I shall vote for the appointment
7454: of Mr. Tyke, but I should not have known, if Mr. Hackbutt hadn’t hinted
7455: it, that I was a Servile Crawler.”
7456: 
7457: “I disclaim any personalities. I expressly said, if I may be allowed to
7458: repeat, or even to conclude what I was about to say—”
7459: 
7460: “Ah, here’s Minchin!” said Mr. Frank Hawley; at which everybody turned
7461: away from Mr. Hackbutt, leaving him to feel the uselessness of superior
7462: gifts in Middlemarch. “Come, Doctor, I must have you on the right side,
7463: eh?”
7464: 
7465: “I hope so,” said Dr. Minchin, nodding and shaking hands here and
7466: there; “at whatever cost to my feelings.”
7467: 
7468: “If there’s any feeling here, it should be feeling for the man who is
7469: turned out, I think,” said Mr. Frank Hawley.
7470: 
7471: “I confess I have feelings on the other side also. I have a divided
7472: esteem,” said Dr. Minchin, rubbing his hands. “I consider Mr. Tyke an
7473: exemplary man—none more so—and I believe him to be proposed from
7474: unimpeachable motives. I, for my part, wish that I could give him my
7475: vote. But I am constrained to take a view of the case which gives the
7476: preponderance to Mr. Farebrother’s claims. He is an amiable man, an
7477: able preacher, and has been longer among us.”
7478: 
7479: Old Mr. Powderell looked on, sad and silent. Mr. Plymdale settled his
7480: cravat, uneasily.
7481: 
7482: “You don’t set up Farebrother as a pattern of what a clergyman ought to
7483: be, I hope,” said Mr. Larcher, the eminent carrier, who had just come
7484: in. “I have no ill-will towards him, but I think we owe something to
7485: the public, not to speak of anything higher, in these appointments. In
7486: my opinion Farebrother is too lax for a clergyman. I don’t wish to
7487: bring up particulars against him; but he will make a little attendance
7488: here go as far as he can.”
7489: 
7490: “And a devilish deal better than too much,” said Mr. Hawley, whose bad
7491: language was notorious in that part of the county. “Sick people can’t
7492: bear so much praying and preaching. And that methodistical sort of
7493: religion is bad for the spirits—bad for the inside, eh?” he added,
7494: turning quickly round to the four medical men who were assembled.
7495: 
7496: But any answer was dispensed with by the entrance of three gentlemen,
7497: with whom there were greetings more or less cordial. These were the
7498: Reverend Edward Thesiger, Rector of St. Peter’s, Mr. Bulstrode, and our
7499: friend Mr. Brooke of Tipton, who had lately allowed himself to be put
7500: on the board of directors in his turn, but had never before attended,
7501: his attendance now being due to Mr. Bulstrode’s exertions. Lydgate was
7502: the only person still expected.
7503: 
7504: Every one now sat down, Mr. Bulstrode presiding, pale and
7505: self-restrained as usual. Mr. Thesiger, a moderate evangelical, wished
7506: for the appointment of his friend Mr. Tyke, a zealous able man, who,
7507: officiating at a chapel of ease, had not a cure of souls too extensive
7508: to leave him ample time for the new duty. It was desirable that
7509: chaplaincies of this kind should be entered on with a fervent
7510: intention: they were peculiar opportunities for spiritual influence;
7511: and while it was good that a salary should be allotted, there was the
7512: more need for scrupulous watching lest the office should be perverted
7513: into a mere question of salary. Mr. Thesiger’s manner had so much quiet
7514: propriety that objectors could only simmer in silence.
7515: 
7516: Mr. Brooke believed that everybody meant well in the matter. He had not
7517: himself attended to the affairs of the Infirmary, though he had a
7518: strong interest in whatever was for the benefit of Middlemarch, and was
7519: most happy to meet the gentlemen present on any public question—“any
7520: public question, you know,” Mr. Brooke repeated, with his nod of
7521: perfect understanding. “I am a good deal occupied as a magistrate, and
7522: in the collection of documentary evidence, but I regard my time as
7523: being at the disposal of the public—and, in short, my friends have
7524: convinced me that a chaplain with a salary—a salary, you know—is a very
7525: good thing, and I am happy to be able to come here and vote for the
7526: appointment of Mr. Tyke, who, I understand, is an unexceptionable man,
7527: apostolic and eloquent and everything of that kind—and I am the last
7528: man to withhold my vote—under the circumstances, you know.”
7529: 
7530: “It seems to me that you have been crammed with one side of the
7531: question, Mr. Brooke,” said Mr. Frank Hawley, who was afraid of nobody,
7532: and was a Tory suspicious of electioneering intentions. “You don’t seem
7533: to know that one of the worthiest men we have has been doing duty as
7534: chaplain here for years without pay, and that Mr. Tyke is proposed to
7535: supersede him.”
7536: 
7537: “Excuse me, Mr. Hawley,” said Mr. Bulstrode. “Mr. Brooke has been fully
7538: informed of Mr. Farebrother’s character and position.”
7539: 
7540: “By his enemies,” flashed out Mr. Hawley.
7541: 
7542: “I trust there is no personal hostility concerned here,” said Mr.
7543: Thesiger.
7544: 
7545: “I’ll swear there is, though,” retorted Mr. Hawley.
7546: 
7547: “Gentlemen,” said Mr. Bulstrode, in a subdued tone, “the merits of the
7548: question may be very briefly stated, and if any one present doubts that
7549: every gentleman who is about to give his vote has not been fully
7550: informed, I can now recapitulate the considerations that should weigh
7551: on either side.”
7552: 
7553: “I don’t see the good of that,” said Mr. Hawley. “I suppose we all know
7554: whom we mean to vote for. Any man who wants to do justice does not wait
7555: till the last minute to hear both sides of the question. I have no time
7556: to lose, and I propose that the matter be put to the vote at once.”
7557: 
7558: A brief but still hot discussion followed before each person wrote
7559: “Tyke” or “Farebrother” on a piece of paper and slipped it into a glass
7560: tumbler; and in the mean time Mr. Bulstrode saw Lydgate enter.
7561: 
7562: “I perceive that the votes are equally divided at present,” said Mr.
7563: Bulstrode, in a clear biting voice. Then, looking up at Lydgate—
7564: 
7565: “There is a casting-vote still to be given. It is yours, Mr. Lydgate:
7566: will you be good enough to write?”
7567: 
7568: “The thing is settled now,” said Mr. Wrench, rising. “We all know how
7569: Mr. Lydgate will vote.”
7570: 
7571: “You seem to speak with some peculiar meaning, sir,” said Lydgate,
7572: rather defiantly, and keeping his pencil suspended.
7573: 
7574: “I merely mean that you are expected to vote with Mr. Bulstrode. Do you
7575: regard that meaning as offensive?”
7576: 
7577: “It may be offensive to others. But I shall not desist from voting with
7578: him on that account.” Lydgate immediately wrote down “Tyke.”
7579: 
7580: So the Rev. Walter Tyke became chaplain to the Infirmary, and Lydgate
7581: continued to work with Mr. Bulstrode. He was really uncertain whether
7582: Tyke were not the more suitable candidate, and yet his consciousness
7583: told him that if he had been quite free from indirect bias he should
7584: have voted for Mr. Farebrother. The affair of the chaplaincy remained a
7585: sore point in his memory as a case in which this petty medium of
7586: Middlemarch had been too strong for him. How could a man be satisfied
7587: with a decision between such alternatives and under such circumstances?
7588: No more than he can be satisfied with his hat, which he has chosen from
7589: among such shapes as the resources of the age offer him, wearing it at
7590: best with a resignation which is chiefly supported by comparison.
7591: 
7592: But Mr. Farebrother met him with the same friendliness as before. The
7593: character of the publican and sinner is not always practically
7594: incompatible with that of the modern Pharisee, for the majority of us
7595: scarcely see more distinctly the faultiness of our own conduct than the
7596: faultiness of our own arguments, or the dulness of our own jokes. But
7597: the Vicar of St. Botolph’s had certainly escaped the slightest tincture
7598: of the Pharisee, and by dint of admitting to himself that he was too
7599: much as other men were, he had become remarkably unlike them in
7600: this—that he could excuse others for thinking slightly of him, and
7601: could judge impartially of their conduct even when it told against him.
7602: 
7603: “The world has been too strong for _me_, I know,” he said one day to
7604: Lydgate. “But then I am not a mighty man—I shall never be a man of
7605: renown. The choice of Hercules is a pretty fable; but Prodicus makes it
7606: easy work for the hero, as if the first resolves were enough. Another
7607: story says that he came to hold the distaff, and at last wore the
7608: Nessus shirt. I suppose one good resolve might keep a man right if
7609: everybody else’s resolve helped him.”
7610: 
7611: The Vicar’s talk was not always inspiriting: he had escaped being a
7612: Pharisee, but he had not escaped that low estimate of possibilities
7613: which we rather hastily arrive at as an inference from our own failure.
7614: Lydgate thought that there was a pitiable infirmity of will in Mr.
7615: Farebrother.
7616:

7620: CHAPTER XIX.
7621: 
7622: “L’ altra vedete ch’ha fatto alla guancia
7623: Della sua palma, sospirando, letto.”
7624: —_Purgatorio_, vii.
7625: 
7626: 
7627: When George the Fourth was still reigning over the privacies of
7628: Windsor, when the Duke of Wellington was Prime Minister, and Mr. Vincy
7629: was mayor of the old corporation in Middlemarch, Mrs. Casaubon, born
7630: Dorothea Brooke, had taken her wedding journey to Rome. In those days
7631: the world in general was more ignorant of good and evil by forty years
7632: than it is at present. Travellers did not often carry full information
7633: on Christian art either in their heads or their pockets; and even the
7634: most brilliant English critic of the day mistook the flower-flushed
7635: tomb of the ascended Virgin for an ornamental vase due to the painter’s
7636: fancy. Romanticism, which has helped to fill some dull blanks with love
7637: and knowledge, had not yet penetrated the times with its leaven and
7638: entered into everybody’s food; it was fermenting still as a
7639: distinguishable vigorous enthusiasm in certain long-haired German
7640: artists at Rome, and the youth of other nations who worked or idled
7641: near them were sometimes caught in the spreading movement.
7642: 
7643: One fine morning a young man whose hair was not immoderately long, but
7644: abundant and curly, and who was otherwise English in his equipment, had
7645: just turned his back on the Belvedere Torso in the Vatican and was
7646: looking out on the magnificent view of the mountains from the adjoining
7647: round vestibule. He was sufficiently absorbed not to notice the
7648: approach of a dark-eyed, animated German who came up to him and placing
7649: a hand on his shoulder, said with a strong accent, “Come here, quick!
7650: else she will have changed her pose.”
7651: 
7652: Quickness was ready at the call, and the two figures passed lightly
7653: along by the Meleager, towards the hall where the reclining Ariadne,
7654: then called the Cleopatra, lies in the marble voluptuousness of her
7655: beauty, the drapery folding around her with a petal-like ease and
7656: tenderness. They were just in time to see another figure standing
7657: against a pedestal near the reclining marble: a breathing blooming
7658: girl, whose form, not shamed by the Ariadne, was clad in Quakerish gray
7659: drapery; her long cloak, fastened at the neck, was thrown backward from
7660: her arms, and one beautiful ungloved hand pillowed her cheek, pushing
7661: somewhat backward the white beaver bonnet which made a sort of halo to
7662: her face around the simply braided dark-brown hair. She was not looking
7663: at the sculpture, probably not thinking of it: her large eyes were
7664: fixed dreamily on a streak of sunlight which fell across the floor. But
7665: she became conscious of the two strangers who suddenly paused as if to
7666: contemplate the Cleopatra, and, without looking at them, immediately
7667: turned away to join a maid-servant and courier who were loitering along
7668: the hall at a little distance off.
7669: 
7670: “What do you think of that for a fine bit of antithesis?” said the
7671: German, searching in his friend’s face for responding admiration, but
7672: going on volubly without waiting for any other answer. “There lies
7673: antique beauty, not corpse-like even in death, but arrested in the
7674: complete contentment of its sensuous perfection: and here stands beauty
7675: in its breathing life, with the consciousness of Christian centuries in
7676: its bosom. But she should be dressed as a nun; I think she looks almost
7677: what you call a Quaker; I would dress her as a nun in my picture.
7678: However, she is married; I saw her wedding-ring on that wonderful left
7679: hand, otherwise I should have thought the sallow _Geistlicher_ was her
7680: father. I saw him parting from her a good while ago, and just now I
7681: found her in that magnificent pose. Only think! he is perhaps rich, and
7682: would like to have her portrait taken. Ah! it is no use looking after
7683: her—there she goes! Let us follow her home!”
7684: 
7685: “No, no,” said his companion, with a little frown.
7686: 
7687: “You are singular, Ladislaw. You look struck together. Do you know
7688: her?”
7689: 
7690: “I know that she is married to my cousin,” said Will Ladislaw,
7691: sauntering down the hall with a preoccupied air, while his German
7692: friend kept at his side and watched him eagerly.
7693: 
7694: “What! the _Geistlicher_? He looks more like an uncle—a more useful
7695: sort of relation.”
7696: 
7697: “He is not my uncle. I tell you he is my second cousin,” said Ladislaw,
7698: with some irritation.
7699: 
7700: “Schön, schön. Don’t be snappish. You are not angry with me for
7701: thinking Mrs. Second-Cousin the most perfect young Madonna I ever saw?”
7702: 
7703: “Angry? nonsense. I have only seen her once before, for a couple of
7704: minutes, when my cousin introduced her to me, just before I left
7705: England. They were not married then. I didn’t know they were coming to
7706: Rome.”
7707: 
7708: “But you will go to see them now—you will find out what they have for
7709: an address—since you know the name. Shall we go to the post? And you
7710: could speak about the portrait.”
7711: 
7712: “Confound you, Naumann! I don’t know what I shall do. I am not so
7713: brazen as you.”
7714: 
7715: “Bah! that is because you are dilettantish and amateurish. If you were
7716: an artist, you would think of Mistress Second-Cousin as antique form
7717: animated by Christian sentiment—a sort of Christian Antigone—sensuous
7718: force controlled by spiritual passion.”
7719: 
7720: “Yes, and that your painting her was the chief outcome of her
7721: existence—the divinity passing into higher completeness and all but
7722: exhausted in the act of covering your bit of canvas. I am amateurish if
7723: you like: I do _not_ think that all the universe is straining towards
7724: the obscure significance of your pictures.”
7725: 
7726: “But it is, my dear!—so far as it is straining through me, Adolf
7727: Naumann: that stands firm,” said the good-natured painter, putting a
7728: hand on Ladislaw’s shoulder, and not in the least disturbed by the
7729: unaccountable touch of ill-humor in his tone. “See now! My existence
7730: presupposes the existence of the whole universe—does it _not?_ and my
7731: function is to paint—and as a painter I have a conception which is
7732: altogether _genialisch_, of your great-aunt or second grandmother as a
7733: subject for a picture; therefore, the universe is straining towards
7734: that picture through that particular hook or claw which it puts forth
7735: in the shape of me—not true?”
7736: 
7737: “But how if another claw in the shape of me is straining to thwart
7738: it?—the case is a little less simple then.”
7739: 
7740: “Not at all: the result of the struggle is the same thing—picture or no
7741: picture—logically.”
7742: 
7743: Will could not resist this imperturbable temper, and the cloud in his
7744: face broke into sunshiny laughter.
7745: 
7746: “Come now, my friend—you will help?” said Naumann, in a hopeful tone.
7747: 
7748: “No; nonsense, Naumann! English ladies are not at everybody’s service
7749: as models. And you want to express too much with your painting. You
7750: would only have made a better or worse portrait with a background which
7751: every connoisseur would give a different reason for or against. And
7752: what is a portrait of a woman? Your painting and Plastik are poor stuff
7753: after all. They perturb and dull conceptions instead of raising them.
7754: Language is a finer medium.”
7755: 
7756: “Yes, for those who can’t paint,” said Naumann. “There you have perfect
7757: right. I did not recommend you to paint, my friend.”
7758: 
7759: The amiable artist carried his sting, but Ladislaw did not choose to
7760: appear stung. He went on as if he had not heard.
7761: 
7762: “Language gives a fuller image, which is all the better for being
7763: vague. After all, the true seeing is within; and painting stares at you
7764: with an insistent imperfection. I feel that especially about
7765: representations of women. As if a woman were a mere colored
7766: superficies! You must wait for movement and tone. There is a difference
7767: in their very breathing: they change from moment to moment.—This woman
7768: whom you have just seen, for example: how would you paint her voice,
7769: pray? But her voice is much diviner than anything you have seen of
7770: her.”
7771: 
7772: “I see, I see. You are jealous. No man must presume to think that he
7773: can paint your ideal. This is serious, my friend! Your great-aunt! ‘Der
7774: Neffe als Onkel’ in a tragic sense—_ungeheuer!_”
7775: 
7776: “You and I shall quarrel, Naumann, if you call that lady my aunt
7777: again.”
7778: 
7779: “How is she to be called then?”
7780: 
7781: “Mrs. Casaubon.”
7782: 
7783: “Good. Suppose I get acquainted with her in spite of you, and find that
7784: she very much wishes to be painted?”
7785: 
7786: “Yes, suppose!” said Will Ladislaw, in a contemptuous undertone,
7787: intended to dismiss the subject. He was conscious of being irritated by
7788: ridiculously small causes, which were half of his own creation. Why was
7789: he making any fuss about Mrs. Casaubon? And yet he felt as if something
7790: had happened to him with regard to her. There are characters which are
7791: continually creating collisions and nodes for themselves in dramas
7792: which nobody is prepared to act with them. Their susceptibilities will
7793: clash against objects that remain innocently quiet.
7794: 
7795: 
7796: 
7797: 
7798: CHAPTER XX.
7799: 
7800: “A child forsaken, waking suddenly,
7801: Whose gaze afeard on all things round doth rove,
7802: And seeth only that it cannot see
7803:     The meeting eyes of love.”
7804: 
7805: 
7806: Two hours later, Dorothea was seated in an inner room or boudoir of a
7807: handsome apartment in the Via Sistina.
7808: 
7809: I am sorry to add that she was sobbing bitterly, with such abandonment
7810: to this relief of an oppressed heart as a woman habitually controlled
7811: by pride on her own account and thoughtfulness for others will
7812: sometimes allow herself when she feels securely alone. And Mr. Casaubon
7813: was certain to remain away for some time at the Vatican.
7814: 
7815: Yet Dorothea had no distinctly shapen grievance that she could state
7816: even to herself; and in the midst of her confused thought and passion,
7817: the mental act that was struggling forth into clearness was a
7818: self-accusing cry that her feeling of desolation was the fault of her
7819: own spiritual poverty. She had married the man of her choice, and with
7820: the advantage over most girls that she had contemplated her marriage
7821: chiefly as the beginning of new duties: from the very first she had
7822: thought of Mr. Casaubon as having a mind so much above her own, that he
7823: must often be claimed by studies which she could not entirely share;
7824: moreover, after the brief narrow experience of her girlhood she was
7825: beholding Rome, the city of visible history, where the past of a whole
7826: hemisphere seems moving in funeral procession with strange ancestral
7827: images and trophies gathered from afar.
7828: 
7829: But this stupendous fragmentariness heightened the dreamlike
7830: strangeness of her bridal life. Dorothea had now been five weeks in
7831: Rome, and in the kindly mornings when autumn and winter seemed to go
7832: hand in hand like a happy aged couple one of whom would presently
7833: survive in chiller loneliness, she had driven about at first with Mr.
7834: Casaubon, but of late chiefly with Tantripp and their experienced
7835: courier. She had been led through the best galleries, had been taken to
7836: the chief points of view, had been shown the grandest ruins and the
7837: most glorious churches, and she had ended by oftenest choosing to drive
7838: out to the Campagna where she could feel alone with the earth and sky,
7839: away-from the oppressive masquerade of ages, in which her own life too
7840: seemed to become a masque with enigmatical costumes.
7841: 
7842: To those who have looked at Rome with the quickening power of a
7843: knowledge which breathes a growing soul into all historic shapes, and
7844: traces out the suppressed transitions which unite all contrasts, Rome
7845: may still be the spiritual centre and interpreter of the world. But let
7846: them conceive one more historical contrast: the gigantic broken
7847: revelations of that Imperial and Papal city thrust abruptly on the
7848: notions of a girl who had been brought up in English and Swiss
7849: Puritanism, fed on meagre Protestant histories and on art chiefly of
7850: the hand-screen sort; a girl whose ardent nature turned all her small
7851: allowance of knowledge into principles, fusing her actions into their
7852: mould, and whose quick emotions gave the most abstract things the
7853: quality of a pleasure or a pain; a girl who had lately become a wife,
7854: and from the enthusiastic acceptance of untried duty found herself
7855: plunged in tumultuous preoccupation with her personal lot. The weight
7856: of unintelligible Rome might lie easily on bright nymphs to whom it
7857: formed a background for the brilliant picnic of Anglo-foreign society;
7858: but Dorothea had no such defence against deep impressions. Ruins and
7859: basilicas, palaces and colossi, set in the midst of a sordid present,
7860: where all that was living and warm-blooded seemed sunk in the deep
7861: degeneracy of a superstition divorced from reverence; the dimmer but
7862: yet eager Titanic life gazing and struggling on walls and ceilings; the
7863: long vistas of white forms whose marble eyes seemed to hold the
7864: monotonous light of an alien world: all this vast wreck of ambitious
7865: ideals, sensuous and spiritual, mixed confusedly with the signs of
7866: breathing forgetfulness and degradation, at first jarred her as with an
7867: electric shock, and then urged themselves on her with that ache
7868: belonging to a glut of confused ideas which check the flow of emotion.
7869: Forms both pale and glowing took possession of her young sense, and
7870: fixed themselves in her memory even when she was not thinking of them,
7871: preparing strange associations which remained through her after-years.
7872: Our moods are apt to bring with them images which succeed each other
7873: like the magic-lantern pictures of a doze; and in certain states of
7874: dull forlornness Dorothea all her life continued to see the vastness of
7875: St. Peter’s, the huge bronze canopy, the excited intention in the
7876: attitudes and garments of the prophets and evangelists in the mosaics
7877: above, and the red drapery which was being hung for Christmas spreading
7878: itself everywhere like a disease of the retina.
7879: 
7880: Not that this inward amazement of Dorothea’s was anything very
7881: exceptional: many souls in their young nudity are tumbled out among
7882: incongruities and left to “find their feet” among them, while their
7883: elders go about their business. Nor can I suppose that when Mrs.
7884: Casaubon is discovered in a fit of weeping six weeks after her wedding,
7885: the situation will be regarded as tragic. Some discouragement, some
7886: faintness of heart at the new real future which replaces the imaginary,
7887: is not unusual, and we do not expect people to be deeply moved by what
7888: is not unusual. That element of tragedy which lies in the very fact of
7889: frequency, has not yet wrought itself into the coarse emotion of
7890: mankind; and perhaps our frames could hardly bear much of it. If we had
7891: a keen vision and feeling of all ordinary human life, it would be like
7892: hearing the grass grow and the squirrel’s heart beat, and we should die
7893: of that roar which lies on the other side of silence. As it is, the
7894: quickest of us walk about well wadded with stupidity.
7895: 
7896: However, Dorothea was crying, and if she had been required to state the
7897: cause, she could only have done so in some such general words as I have
7898: already used: to have been driven to be more particular would have been
7899: like trying to give a history of the lights and shadows, for that new
7900: real future which was replacing the imaginary drew its material from
7901: the endless minutiae by which her view of Mr. Casaubon and her wifely
7902: relation, now that she was married to him, was gradually changing with
7903: the secret motion of a watch-hand from what it had been in her maiden
7904: dream. It was too early yet for her fully to recognize or at least
7905: admit the change, still more for her to have readjusted that
7906: devotedness which was so necessary a part of her mental life that she
7907: was almost sure sooner or later to recover it. Permanent rebellion, the
7908: disorder of a life without some loving reverent resolve, was not
7909: possible to her; but she was now in an interval when the very force of
7910: her nature heightened its confusion. In this way, the early months of
7911: marriage often are times of critical tumult—whether that of a
7912: shrimp-pool or of deeper waters—which afterwards subsides into cheerful
7913: peace.
7914: 
7915: But was not Mr. Casaubon just as learned as before? Had his forms of
7916: expression changed, or his sentiments become less laudable? Oh
7917: waywardness of womanhood! did his chronology fail him, or his ability
7918: to state not only a theory but the names of those who held it; or his
7919: provision for giving the heads of any subject on demand? And was not
7920: Rome the place in all the world to give free play to such
7921: accomplishments? Besides, had not Dorothea’s enthusiasm especially
7922: dwelt on the prospect of relieving the weight and perhaps the sadness
7923: with which great tasks lie on him who has to achieve them?— And that
7924: such weight pressed on Mr. Casaubon was only plainer than before.
7925: 
7926: All these are crushing questions; but whatever else remained the same,
7927: the light had changed, and you cannot find the pearly dawn at noonday.
7928: The fact is unalterable, that a fellow-mortal with whose nature you are
7929: acquainted solely through the brief entrances and exits of a few
7930: imaginative weeks called courtship, may, when seen in the continuity of
7931: married companionship, be disclosed as something better or worse than
7932: what you have preconceived, but will certainly not appear altogether
7933: the same. And it would be astonishing to find how soon the change is
7934: felt if we had no kindred changes to compare with it. To share lodgings
7935: with a brilliant dinner-companion, or to see your favorite politician
7936: in the Ministry, may bring about changes quite as rapid: in these cases
7937: too we begin by knowing little and believing much, and we sometimes end
7938: by inverting the quantities.
7939: 
7940: Still, such comparisons might mislead, for no man was more incapable of
7941: flashy make-believe than Mr. Casaubon: he was as genuine a character as
7942: any ruminant animal, and he had not actively assisted in creating any
7943: illusions about himself. How was it that in the weeks since her
7944: marriage, Dorothea had not distinctly observed but felt with a stifling
7945: depression, that the large vistas and wide fresh air which she had
7946: dreamed of finding in her husband’s mind were replaced by anterooms and
7947: winding passages which seemed to lead nowhither? I suppose it was that
7948: in courtship everything is regarded as provisional and preliminary, and
7949: the smallest sample of virtue or accomplishment is taken to guarantee
7950: delightful stores which the broad leisure of marriage will reveal. But
7951: the door-sill of marriage once crossed, expectation is concentrated on
7952: the present. Having once embarked on your marital voyage, it is
7953: impossible not to be aware that you make no way and that the sea is not
7954: within sight—that, in fact, you are exploring an enclosed basin.
7955: 
7956: In their conversation before marriage, Mr. Casaubon had often dwelt on
7957: some explanation or questionable detail of which Dorothea did not see
7958: the bearing; but such imperfect coherence seemed due to the brokenness
7959: of their intercourse, and, supported by her faith in their future, she
7960: had listened with fervid patience to a recitation of possible arguments
7961: to be brought against Mr. Casaubon’s entirely new view of the
7962: Philistine god Dagon and other fish-deities, thinking that hereafter
7963: she should see this subject which touched him so nearly from the same
7964: high ground whence doubtless it had become so important to him. Again,
7965: the matter-of-course statement and tone of dismissal with which he
7966: treated what to her were the most stirring thoughts, was easily
7967: accounted for as belonging to the sense of haste and preoccupation in
7968: which she herself shared during their engagement. But now, since they
7969: had been in Rome, with all the depths of her emotion roused to
7970: tumultuous activity, and with life made a new problem by new elements,
7971: she had been becoming more and more aware, with a certain terror, that
7972: her mind was continually sliding into inward fits of anger and
7973: repulsion, or else into forlorn weariness. How far the judicious Hooker
7974: or any other hero of erudition would have been the same at Mr.
7975: Casaubon’s time of life, she had no means of knowing, so that he could
7976: not have the advantage of comparison; but her husband’s way of
7977: commenting on the strangely impressive objects around them had begun to
7978: affect her with a sort of mental shiver: he had perhaps the best
7979: intention of acquitting himself worthily, but only of acquitting
7980: himself. What was fresh to her mind was worn out to his; and such
7981: capacity of thought and feeling as had ever been stimulated in him by
7982: the general life of mankind had long shrunk to a sort of dried
7983: preparation, a lifeless embalmment of knowledge.
7984: 
7985: When he said, “Does this interest you, Dorothea? Shall we stay a little
7986: longer? I am ready to stay if you wish it,”—it seemed to her as if
7987: going or staying were alike dreary. Or, “Should you like to go to the
7988: Farnesina, Dorothea? It contains celebrated frescos designed or painted
7989: by Raphael, which most persons think it worth while to visit.”
7990: 
7991: “But do you care about them?” was always Dorothea’s question.
7992: 
7993: “They are, I believe, highly esteemed. Some of them represent the fable
7994: of Cupid and Psyche, which is probably the romantic invention of a
7995: literary period, and cannot, I think, be reckoned as a genuine mythical
7996: product. But if you like these wall-paintings we can easily drive
7997: thither; and you will then, I think, have seen the chief works of
7998: Raphael, any of which it were a pity to omit in a visit to Rome. He is
7999: the painter who has been held to combine the most complete grace of
8000: form with sublimity of expression. Such at least I have gathered to be
8001: the opinion of cognoscenti.”
8002: 
8003: This kind of answer given in a measured official tone, as of a
8004: clergyman reading according to the rubric, did not help to justify the
8005: glories of the Eternal City, or to give her the hope that if she knew
8006: more about them the world would be joyously illuminated for her. There
8007: is hardly any contact more depressing to a young ardent creature than
8008: that of a mind in which years full of knowledge seem to have issued in
8009: a blank absence of interest or sympathy.
8010: 
8011: On other subjects indeed Mr. Casaubon showed a tenacity of occupation
8012: and an eagerness which are usually regarded as the effect of
8013: enthusiasm, and Dorothea was anxious to follow this spontaneous
8014: direction of his thoughts, instead of being made to feel that she
8015: dragged him away from it. But she was gradually ceasing to expect with
8016: her former delightful confidence that she should see any wide opening
8017: where she followed him. Poor Mr. Casaubon himself was lost among small
8018: closets and winding stairs, and in an agitated dimness about the
8019: Cabeiri, or in an exposure of other mythologists’ ill-considered
8020: parallels, easily lost sight of any purpose which had prompted him to
8021: these labors. With his taper stuck before him he forgot the absence of
8022: windows, and in bitter manuscript remarks on other men’s notions about
8023: the solar deities, he had become indifferent to the sunlight.
8024: 
8025: These characteristics, fixed and unchangeable as bone in Mr. Casaubon,
8026: might have remained longer unfelt by Dorothea if she had been
8027: encouraged to pour forth her girlish and womanly feeling—if he would
8028: have held her hands between his and listened with the delight of
8029: tenderness and understanding to all the little histories which made up
8030: her experience, and would have given her the same sort of intimacy in
8031: return, so that the past life of each could be included in their mutual
8032: knowledge and affection—or if she could have fed her affection with
8033: those childlike caresses which are the bent of every sweet woman, who
8034: has begun by showering kisses on the hard pate of her bald doll,
8035: creating a happy soul within that woodenness from the wealth of her own
8036: love. That was Dorothea’s bent. With all her yearning to know what was
8037: afar from her and to be widely benignant, she had ardor enough for what
8038: was near, to have kissed Mr. Casaubon’s coat-sleeve, or to have
8039: caressed his shoe-latchet, if he would have made any other sign of
8040: acceptance than pronouncing her, with his unfailing propriety, to be of
8041: a most affectionate and truly feminine nature, indicating at the same
8042: time by politely reaching a chair for her that he regarded these
8043: manifestations as rather crude and startling. Having made his clerical
8044: toilet with due care in the morning, he was prepared only for those
8045: amenities of life which were suited to the well-adjusted stiff cravat
8046: of the period, and to a mind weighted with unpublished matter.
8047: 
8048: And by a sad contradiction Dorothea’s ideas and resolves seemed like
8049: melting ice floating and lost in the warm flood of which they had been
8050: but another form. She was humiliated to find herself a mere victim of
8051: feeling, as if she could know nothing except through that medium: all
8052: her strength was scattered in fits of agitation, of struggle, of
8053: despondency, and then again in visions of more complete renunciation,
8054: transforming all hard conditions into duty. Poor Dorothea! she was
8055: certainly troublesome—to herself chiefly; but this morning for the
8056: first time she had been troublesome to Mr. Casaubon.
8057: 
8058: She had begun, while they were taking coffee, with a determination to
8059: shake off what she inwardly called her selfishness, and turned a face
8060: all cheerful attention to her husband when he said, “My dear Dorothea,
8061: we must now think of all that is yet left undone, as a preliminary to
8062: our departure. I would fain have returned home earlier that we might
8063: have been at Lowick for the Christmas; but my inquiries here have been
8064: protracted beyond their anticipated period. I trust, however, that the
8065: time here has not been passed unpleasantly to you. Among the sights of
8066: Europe, that of Rome has ever been held one of the most striking and in
8067: some respects edifying. I well remember that I considered it an epoch
8068: in my life when I visited it for the first time; after the fall of
8069: Napoleon, an event which opened the Continent to travellers. Indeed I
8070: think it is one among several cities to which an extreme hyperbole has
8071: been applied—‘See Rome and die:’ but in your case I would propose an
8072: emendation and say, See Rome as a bride, and live henceforth as a happy
8073: wife.”
8074: 
8075: Mr. Casaubon pronounced this little speech with the most conscientious
8076: intention, blinking a little and swaying his head up and down, and
8077: concluding with a smile. He had not found marriage a rapturous state,
8078: but he had no idea of being anything else than an irreproachable
8079: husband, who would make a charming young woman as happy as she deserved
8080: to be.
8081: 
8082: “I hope you are thoroughly satisfied with our stay—I mean, with the
8083: result so far as your studies are concerned,” said Dorothea, trying to
8084: keep her mind fixed on what most affected her husband.
8085: 
8086: “Yes,” said Mr. Casaubon, with that peculiar pitch of voice which makes
8087: the word half a negative. “I have been led farther than I had foreseen,
8088: and various subjects for annotation have presented themselves which,
8089: though I have no direct need of them, I could not pretermit. The task,
8090: notwithstanding the assistance of my amanuensis, has been a somewhat
8091: laborious one, but your society has happily prevented me from that too
8092: continuous prosecution of thought beyond the hours of study which has
8093: been the snare of my solitary life.”
8094: 
8095: “I am very glad that my presence has made any difference to you,” said
8096: Dorothea, who had a vivid memory of evenings in which she had supposed
8097: that Mr. Casaubon’s mind had gone too deep during the day to be able to
8098: get to the surface again. I fear there was a little temper in her
8099: reply. “I hope when we get to Lowick, I shall be more useful to you,
8100: and be able to enter a little more into what interests you.”
8101: 
8102: “Doubtless, my dear,” said Mr. Casaubon, with a slight bow. “The notes
8103: I have here made will want sifting, and you can, if you please, extract
8104: them under my direction.”
8105: 
8106: “And all your notes,” said Dorothea, whose heart had already burned
8107: within her on this subject, so that now she could not help speaking
8108: with her tongue. “All those rows of volumes—will you not now do what
8109: you used to speak of?—will you not make up your mind what part of them
8110: you will use, and begin to write the book which will make your vast
8111: knowledge useful to the world? I will write to your dictation, or I
8112: will copy and extract what you tell me: I can be of no other use.”
8113: Dorothea, in a most unaccountable, darkly feminine manner, ended with a
8114: slight sob and eyes full of tears.
8115: 
8116: The excessive feeling manifested would alone have been highly
8117: disturbing to Mr. Casaubon, but there were other reasons why Dorothea’s
8118: words were among the most cutting and irritating to him that she could
8119: have been impelled to use. She was as blind to his inward troubles as
8120: he to hers: she had not yet learned those hidden conflicts in her
8121: husband which claim our pity. She had not yet listened patiently to his
8122: heartbeats, but only felt that her own was beating violently. In Mr.
8123: Casaubon’s ear, Dorothea’s voice gave loud emphatic iteration to those
8124: muffled suggestions of consciousness which it was possible to explain
8125: as mere fancy, the illusion of exaggerated sensitiveness: always when
8126: such suggestions are unmistakably repeated from without, they are
8127: resisted as cruel and unjust. We are angered even by the full
8128: acceptance of our humiliating confessions—how much more by hearing in
8129: hard distinct syllables from the lips of a near observer, those
8130: confused murmurs which we try to call morbid, and strive against as if
8131: they were the oncoming of numbness! And this cruel outward accuser was
8132: there in the shape of a wife—nay, of a young bride, who, instead of
8133: observing his abundant pen-scratches and amplitude of paper with the
8134: uncritical awe of an elegant-minded canary-bird, seemed to present
8135: herself as a spy watching everything with a malign power of inference.
8136: Here, towards this particular point of the compass, Mr. Casaubon had a
8137: sensitiveness to match Dorothea’s, and an equal quickness to imagine
8138: more than the fact. He had formerly observed with approbation her
8139: capacity for worshipping the right object; he now foresaw with sudden
8140: terror that this capacity might be replaced by presumption, this
8141: worship by the most exasperating of all criticism,—that which sees
8142: vaguely a great many fine ends, and has not the least notion what it
8143: costs to reach them.
8144: 
8145: For the first time since Dorothea had known him, Mr. Casaubon’s face
8146: had a quick angry flush upon it.
8147: 
8148: “My love,” he said, with irritation reined in by propriety, “you may
8149: rely upon me for knowing the times and the seasons, adapted to the
8150: different stages of a work which is not to be measured by the facile
8151: conjectures of ignorant onlookers. It had been easy for me to gain a
8152: temporary effect by a mirage of baseless opinion; but it is ever the
8153: trial of the scrupulous explorer to be saluted with the impatient scorn
8154: of chatterers who attempt only the smallest achievements, being indeed
8155: equipped for no other. And it were well if all such could be admonished
8156: to discriminate judgments of which the true subject-matter lies
8157: entirely beyond their reach, from those of which the elements may be
8158: compassed by a narrow and superficial survey.”
8159: 
8160: This speech was delivered with an energy and readiness quite unusual
8161: with Mr. Casaubon. It was not indeed entirely an improvisation, but had
8162: taken shape in inward colloquy, and rushed out like the round grains
8163: from a fruit when sudden heat cracks it. Dorothea was not only his
8164: wife: she was a personification of that shallow world which surrounds
8165: the appreciated or desponding author.
8166: 
8167: Dorothea was indignant in her turn. Had she not been repressing
8168: everything in herself except the desire to enter into some fellowship
8169: with her husband’s chief interests?
8170: 
8171: “My judgment _was_ a very superficial one—such as I am capable of
8172: forming,” she answered, with a prompt resentment, that needed no
8173: rehearsal. “You showed me the rows of notebooks—you have often spoken
8174: of them—you have often said that they wanted digesting. But I never
8175: heard you speak of the writing that is to be published. Those were very
8176: simple facts, and my judgment went no farther. I only begged you to let
8177: me be of some good to you.”
8178: 
8179: Dorothea rose to leave the table and Mr. Casaubon made no reply, taking
8180: up a letter which lay beside him as if to reperuse it. Both were
8181: shocked at their mutual situation—that each should have betrayed anger
8182: towards the other. If they had been at home, settled at Lowick in
8183: ordinary life among their neighbors, the clash would have been less
8184: embarrassing: but on a wedding journey, the express object of which is
8185: to isolate two people on the ground that they are all the world to each
8186: other, the sense of disagreement is, to say the least, confounding and
8187: stultifying. To have changed your longitude extensively and placed
8188: yourselves in a moral solitude in order to have small explosions, to
8189: find conversation difficult and to hand a glass of water without
8190: looking, can hardly be regarded as satisfactory fulfilment even to the
8191: toughest minds. To Dorothea’s inexperienced sensitiveness, it seemed
8192: like a catastrophe, changing all prospects; and to Mr. Casaubon it was
8193: a new pain, he never having been on a wedding journey before, or found
8194: himself in that close union which was more of a subjection than he had
8195: been able to imagine, since this charming young bride not only obliged
8196: him to much consideration on her behalf (which he had sedulously
8197: given), but turned out to be capable of agitating him cruelly just
8198: where he most needed soothing. Instead of getting a soft fence against
8199: the cold, shadowy, unapplausive audience of his life, had he only given
8200: it a more substantial presence?
8201: 
8202: Neither of them felt it possible to speak again at present. To have
8203: reversed a previous arrangement and declined to go out would have been
8204: a show of persistent anger which Dorothea’s conscience shrank from,
8205: seeing that she already began to feel herself guilty. However just her
8206: indignation might be, her ideal was not to claim justice, but to give
8207: tenderness. So when the carriage came to the door, she drove with Mr.
8208: Casaubon to the Vatican, walked with him through the stony avenue of
8209: inscriptions, and when she parted with him at the entrance to the
8210: Library, went on through the Museum out of mere listlessness as to what
8211: was around her. She had not spirit to turn round and say that she would
8212: drive anywhere. It was when Mr. Casaubon was quitting her that Naumann
8213: had first seen her, and he had entered the long gallery of sculpture at
8214: the same time with her; but here Naumann had to await Ladislaw with
8215: whom he was to settle a bet of champagne about an enigmatical
8216: mediaeval-looking figure there. After they had examined the figure, and
8217: had walked on finishing their dispute, they had parted, Ladislaw
8218: lingering behind while Naumann had gone into the Hall of Statues where
8219: he again saw Dorothea, and saw her in that brooding abstraction which
8220: made her pose remarkable. She did not really see the streak of sunlight
8221: on the floor more than she saw the statues: she was inwardly seeing the
8222: light of years to come in her own home and over the English fields and
8223: elms and hedge-bordered highroads; and feeling that the way in which
8224: they might be filled with joyful devotedness was not so clear to her as
8225: it had been. But in Dorothea’s mind there was a current into which all
8226: thought and feeling were apt sooner or later to flow—the reaching
8227: forward of the whole consciousness towards the fullest truth, the least
8228: partial good. There was clearly something better than anger and
8229: despondency.
8230: 
8231: 
8232: 
8233: 
8234: CHAPTER XXI.
8235: 
8236: “Hire facounde eke full womanly and plain,
8237: No contrefeted termes had she
8238: To semen wise.”
8239: —CHAUCER.
8240: 
8241: 
8242: It was in that way Dorothea came to be sobbing as soon as she was
8243: securely alone. But she was presently roused by a knock at the door,
8244: which made her hastily dry her eyes before saying, “Come in.” Tantripp
8245: had brought a card, and said that there was a gentleman waiting in the
8246: lobby. The courier had told him that only Mrs. Casaubon was at home,
8247: but he said he was a relation of Mr. Casaubon’s: would she see him?
8248: 
8249: “Yes,” said Dorothea, without pause; “show him into the salon.” Her
8250: chief impressions about young Ladislaw were that when she had seen him
8251: at Lowick she had been made aware of Mr. Casaubon’s generosity towards
8252: him, and also that she had been interested in his own hesitation about
8253: his career. She was alive to anything that gave her an opportunity for
8254: active sympathy, and at this moment it seemed as if the visit had come
8255: to shake her out of her self-absorbed discontent—to remind her of her
8256: husband’s goodness, and make her feel that she had now the right to be
8257: his helpmate in all kind deeds. She waited a minute or two, but when
8258: she passed into the next room there were just signs enough that she had
8259: been crying to make her open face look more youthful and appealing than
8260: usual. She met Ladislaw with that exquisite smile of good-will which is
8261: unmixed with vanity, and held out her hand to him. He was the elder by
8262: several years, but at that moment he looked much the younger, for his
8263: transparent complexion flushed suddenly, and he spoke with a shyness
8264: extremely unlike the ready indifference of his manner with his male
8265: companion, while Dorothea became all the calmer with a wondering desire
8266: to put him at ease.
8267: 
8268: “I was not aware that you and Mr. Casaubon were in Rome, until this
8269: morning, when I saw you in the Vatican Museum,” he said. “I knew you at
8270: once—but—I mean, that I concluded Mr. Casaubon’s address would be found
8271: at the Poste Restante, and I was anxious to pay my respects to him and
8272: you as early as possible.”
8273: 
8274: “Pray sit down. He is not here now, but he will be glad to hear of you,
8275: I am sure,” said Dorothea, seating herself unthinkingly between the
8276: fire and the light of the tall window, and pointing to a chair
8277: opposite, with the quietude of a benignant matron. The signs of girlish
8278: sorrow in her face were only the more striking. “Mr. Casaubon is much
8279: engaged; but you will leave your address—will you not?—and he will
8280: write to you.”
8281: 
8282: “You are very good,” said Ladislaw, beginning to lose his diffidence in
8283: the interest with which he was observing the signs of weeping which had
8284: altered her face. “My address is on my card. But if you will allow me I
8285: will call again to-morrow at an hour when Mr. Casaubon is likely to be
8286: at home.”
8287: 
8288: “He goes to read in the Library of the Vatican every day, and you can
8289: hardly see him except by an appointment. Especially now. We are about
8290: to leave Rome, and he is very busy. He is usually away almost from
8291: breakfast till dinner. But I am sure he will wish you to dine with us.”
8292: 
8293: Will Ladislaw was struck mute for a few moments. He had never been fond
8294: of Mr. Casaubon, and if it had not been for the sense of obligation,
8295: would have laughed at him as a Bat of erudition. But the idea of this
8296: dried-up pedant, this elaborator of small explanations about as
8297: important as the surplus stock of false antiquities kept in a vendor’s
8298: back chamber, having first got this adorable young creature to marry
8299: him, and then passing his honeymoon away from her, groping after his
8300: mouldy futilities (Will was given to hyperbole)—this sudden picture
8301: stirred him with a sort of comic disgust: he was divided between the
8302: impulse to laugh aloud and the equally unseasonable impulse to burst
8303: into scornful invective.
8304: 
8305: For an instant he felt that the struggle was causing a queer contortion
8306: of his mobile features, but with a good effort he resolved it into
8307: nothing more offensive than a merry smile.
8308: 
8309: Dorothea wondered; but the smile was irresistible, and shone back from
8310: her face too. Will Ladislaw’s smile was delightful, unless you were
8311: angry with him beforehand: it was a gush of inward light illuminating
8312: the transparent skin as well as the eyes, and playing about every curve
8313: and line as if some Ariel were touching them with a new charm, and
8314: banishing forever the traces of moodiness. The reflection of that smile
8315: could not but have a little merriment in it too, even under dark
8316: eyelashes still moist, as Dorothea said inquiringly, “Something amuses
8317: you?”
8318: 
8319: “Yes,” said Will, quick in finding resources. “I am thinking of the
8320: sort of figure I cut the first time I saw you, when you annihilated my
8321: poor sketch with your criticism.”
8322: 
8323: “My criticism?” said Dorothea, wondering still more. “Surely not. I
8324: always feel particularly ignorant about painting.”
8325: 
8326: “I suspected you of knowing so much, that you knew how to say just what
8327: was most cutting. You said—I dare say you don’t remember it as I
8328: do—that the relation of my sketch to nature was quite hidden from you.
8329: At least, you implied that.” Will could laugh now as well as smile.
8330: 
8331: “That was really my ignorance,” said Dorothea, admiring Will’s
8332: good-humor. “I must have said so only because I never could see any
8333: beauty in the pictures which my uncle told me all judges thought very
8334: fine. And I have gone about with just the same ignorance in Rome. There
8335: are comparatively few paintings that I can really enjoy. At first when
8336: I enter a room where the walls are covered with frescos, or with rare
8337: pictures, I feel a kind of awe—like a child present at great ceremonies
8338: where there are grand robes and processions; I feel myself in the
8339: presence of some higher life than my own. But when I begin to examine
8340: the pictures one by one the life goes out of them, or else is something
8341: violent and strange to me. It must be my own dulness. I am seeing so
8342: much all at once, and not understanding half of it. That always makes
8343: one feel stupid. It is painful to be told that anything is very fine
8344: and not be able to feel that it is fine—something like being blind,
8345: while people talk of the sky.”
8346: 
8347: “Oh, there is a great deal in the feeling for art which must be
8348: acquired,” said Will. (It was impossible now to doubt the directness of
8349: Dorothea’s confession.) “Art is an old language with a great many
8350: artificial affected styles, and sometimes the chief pleasure one gets
8351: out of knowing them is the mere sense of knowing. I enjoy the art of
8352: all sorts here immensely; but I suppose if I could pick my enjoyment to
8353: pieces I should find it made up of many different threads. There is
8354: something in daubing a little one’s self, and having an idea of the
8355: process.”
8356: 
8357: “You mean perhaps to be a painter?” said Dorothea, with a new direction
8358: of interest. “You mean to make painting your profession? Mr. Casaubon
8359: will like to hear that you have chosen a profession.”
8360: 
8361: “No, oh no,” said Will, with some coldness. “I have quite made up my
8362: mind against it. It is too one-sided a life. I have been seeing a great
8363: deal of the German artists here: I travelled from Frankfort with one of
8364: them. Some are fine, even brilliant fellows—but I should not like to
8365: get into their way of looking at the world entirely from the studio
8366: point of view.”
8367: 
8368: “That I can understand,” said Dorothea, cordially. “And in Rome it
8369: seems as if there were so many things which are more wanted in the
8370: world than pictures. But if you have a genius for painting, would it
8371: not be right to take that as a guide? Perhaps you might do better
8372: things than these—or different, so that there might not be so many
8373: pictures almost all alike in the same place.”
8374: 
8375: There was no mistaking this simplicity, and Will was won by it into
8376: frankness. “A man must have a very rare genius to make changes of that
8377: sort. I am afraid mine would not carry me even to the pitch of doing
8378: well what has been done already, at least not so well as to make it
8379: worth while. And I should never succeed in anything by dint of
8380: drudgery. If things don’t come easily to me I never get them.”
8381: 
8382: “I have heard Mr. Casaubon say that he regrets your want of patience,”
8383: said Dorothea, gently. She was rather shocked at this mode of taking
8384: all life as a holiday.
8385: 
8386: “Yes, I know Mr. Casaubon’s opinion. He and I differ.”
8387: 
8388: The slight streak of contempt in this hasty reply offended Dorothea.
8389: She was all the more susceptible about Mr. Casaubon because of her
8390: morning’s trouble.
8391: 
8392: “Certainly you differ,” she said, rather proudly. “I did not think of
8393: comparing you: such power of persevering devoted labor as Mr.
8394: Casaubon’s is not common.”
8395: 
8396: Will saw that she was offended, but this only gave an additional
8397: impulse to the new irritation of his latent dislike towards Mr.
8398: Casaubon. It was too intolerable that Dorothea should be worshipping
8399: this husband: such weakness in a woman is pleasant to no man but the
8400: husband in question. Mortals are easily tempted to pinch the life out
8401: of their neighbor’s buzzing glory, and think that such killing is no
8402: murder.
8403: 
8404: “No, indeed,” he answered, promptly. “And therefore it is a pity that
8405: it should be thrown away, as so much English scholarship is, for want
8406: of knowing what is being done by the rest of the world. If Mr. Casaubon
8407: read German he would save himself a great deal of trouble.”
8408: 
8409: “I do not understand you,” said Dorothea, startled and anxious.
8410: 
8411: “I merely mean,” said Will, in an offhand way, “that the Germans have
8412: taken the lead in historical inquiries, and they laugh at results which
8413: are got by groping about in woods with a pocket-compass while they have
8414: made good roads. When I was with Mr. Casaubon I saw that he deafened
8415: himself in that direction: it was almost against his will that he read
8416: a Latin treatise written by a German. I was very sorry.”
8417: 
8418: Will only thought of giving a good pinch that would annihilate that
8419: vaunted laboriousness, and was unable to imagine the mode in which
8420: Dorothea would be wounded. Young Mr. Ladislaw was not at all deep
8421: himself in German writers; but very little achievement is required in
8422: order to pity another man’s shortcomings.
8423: 
8424: Poor Dorothea felt a pang at the thought that the labor of her
8425: husband’s life might be void, which left her no energy to spare for the
8426: question whether this young relative who was so much obliged to him
8427: ought not to have repressed his observation. She did not even speak,
8428: but sat looking at her hands, absorbed in the piteousness of that
8429: thought.
8430: 
8431: Will, however, having given that annihilating pinch, was rather
8432: ashamed, imagining from Dorothea’s silence that he had offended her
8433: still more; and having also a conscience about plucking the
8434: tail-feathers from a benefactor.
8435: 
8436: “I regretted it especially,” he resumed, taking the usual course from
8437: detraction to insincere eulogy, “because of my gratitude and respect
8438: towards my cousin. It would not signify so much in a man whose talents
8439: and character were less distinguished.”
8440: 
8441: Dorothea raised her eyes, brighter than usual with excited feeling, and
8442: said in her saddest recitative, “How I wish I had learned German when I
8443: was at Lausanne! There were plenty of German teachers. But now I can be
8444: of no use.”
8445: 
8446: There was a new light, but still a mysterious light, for Will in
8447: Dorothea’s last words. The question how she had come to accept Mr.
8448: Casaubon—which he had dismissed when he first saw her by saying that
8449: she must be disagreeable in spite of appearances—was not now to be
8450: answered on any such short and easy method. Whatever else she might be,
8451: she was not disagreeable. She was not coldly clever and indirectly
8452: satirical, but adorably simple and full of feeling. She was an angel
8453: beguiled. It would be a unique delight to wait and watch for the
8454: melodious fragments in which her heart and soul came forth so directly
8455: and ingenuously. The Aeolian harp again came into his mind.
8456: 
8457: She must have made some original romance for herself in this marriage.
8458: And if Mr. Casaubon had been a dragon who had carried her off to his
8459: lair with his talons simply and without legal forms, it would have been
8460: an unavoidable feat of heroism to release her and fall at her feet. But
8461: he was something more unmanageable than a dragon: he was a benefactor
8462: with collective society at his back, and he was at that moment entering
8463: the room in all the unimpeachable correctness of his demeanor, while
8464: Dorothea was looking animated with a newly roused alarm and regret, and
8465: Will was looking animated with his admiring speculation about her
8466: feelings.
8467: 
8468: Mr. Casaubon felt a surprise which was quite unmixed with pleasure, but
8469: he did not swerve from his usual politeness of greeting, when Will rose
8470: and explained his presence. Mr. Casaubon was less happy than usual, and
8471: this perhaps made him look all the dimmer and more faded; else, the
8472: effect might easily have been produced by the contrast of his young
8473: cousin’s appearance. The first impression on seeing Will was one of
8474: sunny brightness, which added to the uncertainty of his changing
8475: expression. Surely, his very features changed their form, his jaw
8476: looked sometimes large and sometimes small; and the little ripple in
8477: his nose was a preparation for metamorphosis. When he turned his head
8478: quickly his hair seemed to shake out light, and some persons thought
8479: they saw decided genius in this coruscation. Mr. Casaubon, on the
8480: contrary, stood rayless.
8481: 
8482: As Dorothea’s eyes were turned anxiously on her husband she was perhaps
8483: not insensible to the contrast, but it was only mingled with other
8484: causes in making her more conscious of that new alarm on his behalf
8485: which was the first stirring of a pitying tenderness fed by the
8486: realities of his lot and not by her own dreams. Yet it was a source of
8487: greater freedom to her that Will was there; his young equality was
8488: agreeable, and also perhaps his openness to conviction. She felt an
8489: immense need of some one to speak to, and she had never before seen any
8490: one who seemed so quick and pliable, so likely to understand
8491: everything.
8492: 
8493: Mr. Casaubon gravely hoped that Will was passing his time profitably as
8494: well as pleasantly in Rome—had thought his intention was to remain in
8495: South Germany—but begged him to come and dine to-morrow, when he could
8496: converse more at large: at present he was somewhat weary. Ladislaw
8497: understood, and accepting the invitation immediately took his leave.
8498: 
8499: Dorothea’s eyes followed her husband anxiously, while he sank down
8500: wearily at the end of a sofa, and resting his elbow supported his head
8501: and looked on the floor. A little flushed, and with bright eyes, she
8502: seated herself beside him, and said—
8503: 
8504: “Forgive me for speaking so hastily to you this morning. I was wrong. I
8505: fear I hurt you and made the day more burdensome.”
8506: 
8507: “I am glad that you feel that, my dear,” said Mr. Casaubon. He spoke
8508: quietly and bowed his head a little, but there was still an uneasy
8509: feeling in his eyes as he looked at her.
8510: 
8511: “But you do forgive me?” said Dorothea, with a quick sob. In her need
8512: for some manifestation of feeling she was ready to exaggerate her own
8513: fault. Would not love see returning penitence afar off, and fall on its
8514: neck and kiss it?
8515: 
8516: “My dear Dorothea—‘who with repentance is not satisfied, is not of
8517: heaven nor earth:’—you do not think me worthy to be banished by that
8518: severe sentence,” said Mr. Casaubon, exerting himself to make a strong
8519: statement, and also to smile faintly.
8520: 
8521: Dorothea was silent, but a tear which had come up with the sob would
8522: insist on falling.
8523: 
8524: “You are excited, my dear. And I also am feeling some unpleasant
8525: consequences of too much mental disturbance,” said Mr. Casaubon. In
8526: fact, he had it in his thought to tell her that she ought not to have
8527: received young Ladislaw in his absence: but he abstained, partly from
8528: the sense that it would be ungracious to bring a new complaint in the
8529: moment of her penitent acknowledgment, partly because he wanted to
8530: avoid further agitation of himself by speech, and partly because he was
8531: too proud to betray that jealousy of disposition which was not so
8532: exhausted on his scholarly compeers that there was none to spare in
8533: other directions. There is a sort of jealousy which needs very little
8534: fire: it is hardly a passion, but a blight bred in the cloudy, damp
8535: despondency of uneasy egoism.
8536: 
8537: “I think it is time for us to dress,” he added, looking at his watch.
8538: They both rose, and there was never any further allusion between them
8539: to what had passed on this day.
8540: 
8541: But Dorothea remembered it to the last with the vividness with which we
8542: all remember epochs in our experience when some dear expectation dies,
8543: or some new motive is born. Today she had begun to see that she had
8544: been under a wild illusion in expecting a response to her feeling from
8545: Mr. Casaubon, and she had felt the waking of a presentiment that there
8546: might be a sad consciousness in his life which made as great a need on
8547: his side as on her own.
8548: 
8549: We are all of us born in moral stupidity, taking the world as an udder
8550: to feed our supreme selves: Dorothea had early begun to emerge from
8551: that stupidity, but yet it had been easier to her to imagine how she
8552: would devote herself to Mr. Casaubon, and become wise and strong in his
8553: strength and wisdom, than to conceive with that distinctness which is
8554: no longer reflection but feeling—an idea wrought back to the directness
8555: of sense, like the solidity of objects—that he had an equivalent centre
8556: of self, whence the lights and shadows must always fall with a certain
8557: difference.
8558: 
8559:

8562: CHAPTER XXII.
8563: 
8564: “Nous câusames longtemps; elle était simple et bonne.
8565: Ne sachant pas le mal, elle faisait le bien;
8566: Des richesses du coeur elle me fit l’aumône,
8567: Et tout en écoutant comme le coeur se donne,
8568: Sans oser y penser je lui donnai le mien;
8569: Elle emporta ma vie, et n’en sut jamais rien.”
8570: —ALFRED DE MUSSET.
8571: 
8572: 
8573: Will Ladislaw was delightfully agreeable at dinner the next day, and
8574: gave no opportunity for Mr. Casaubon to show disapprobation. On the
8575: contrary it seemed to Dorothea that Will had a happier way of drawing
8576: her husband into conversation and of deferentially listening to him
8577: than she had ever observed in any one before. To be sure, the listeners
8578: about Tipton were not highly gifted! Will talked a good deal himself,
8579: but what he said was thrown in with such rapidity, and with such an
8580: unimportant air of saying something by the way, that it seemed a gay
8581: little chime after the great bell. If Will was not always perfect, this
8582: was certainly one of his good days. He described touches of incident
8583: among the poor people in Rome, only to be seen by one who could move
8584: about freely; he found himself in agreement with Mr. Casaubon as to the
8585: unsound opinions of Middleton concerning the relations of Judaism and
8586: Catholicism; and passed easily to a half-enthusiastic half-playful
8587: picture of the enjoyment he got out of the very miscellaneousness of
8588: Rome, which made the mind flexible with constant comparison, and saved
8589: you from seeing the world’s ages as a set of box-like partitions
8590: without vital connection. Mr. Casaubon’s studies, Will observed, had
8591: always been of too broad a kind for that, and he had perhaps never felt
8592: any such sudden effect, but for himself he confessed that Rome had
8593: given him quite a new sense of history as a whole: the fragments
8594: stimulated his imagination and made him constructive. Then
8595: occasionally, but not too often, he appealed to Dorothea, and discussed
8596: what she said, as if her sentiment were an item to be considered in the
8597: final judgment even of the Madonna di Foligno or the Laocoon. A sense
8598: of contributing to form the world’s opinion makes conversation
8599: particularly cheerful; and Mr. Casaubon too was not without his pride
8600: in his young wife, who spoke better than most women, as indeed he had
8601: perceived in choosing her.
8602: 
8603: Since things were going on so pleasantly, Mr. Casaubon’s statement that
8604: his labors in the Library would be suspended for a couple of days, and
8605: that after a brief renewal he should have no further reason for staying
8606: in Rome, encouraged Will to urge that Mrs. Casaubon should not go away
8607: without seeing a studio or two. Would not Mr. Casaubon take her? That
8608: sort of thing ought not to be missed: it was quite special: it was a
8609: form of life that grew like a small fresh vegetation with its
8610: population of insects on huge fossils. Will would be happy to conduct
8611: them—not to anything wearisome, only to a few examples.
8612: 
8613: Mr. Casaubon, seeing Dorothea look earnestly towards him, could not but
8614: ask her if she would be interested in such visits: he was now at her
8615: service during the whole day; and it was agreed that Will should come
8616: on the morrow and drive with them.
8617: 
8618: Will could not omit Thorwaldsen, a living celebrity about whom even Mr.
8619: Casaubon inquired, but before the day was far advanced he led the way
8620: to the studio of his friend Adolf Naumann, whom he mentioned as one of
8621: the chief renovators of Christian art, one of those who had not only
8622: revived but expanded that grand conception of supreme events as
8623: mysteries at which the successive ages were spectators, and in relation
8624: to which the great souls of all periods became as it were
8625: contemporaries. Will added that he had made himself Naumann’s pupil for
8626: the nonce.
8627: 
8628: “I have been making some oil-sketches under him,” said Will. “I hate
8629: copying. I must put something of my own in. Naumann has been painting
8630: the Saints drawing the Car of the Church, and I have been making a
8631: sketch of Marlowe’s Tamburlaine Driving the Conquered Kings in his
8632: Chariot. I am not so ecclesiastical as Naumann, and I sometimes twit
8633: him with his excess of meaning. But this time I mean to outdo him in
8634: breadth of intention. I take Tamburlaine in his chariot for the
8635: tremendous course of the world’s physical history lashing on the
8636: harnessed dynasties. In my opinion, that is a good mythical
8637: interpretation.” Will here looked at Mr. Casaubon, who received this
8638: offhand treatment of symbolism very uneasily, and bowed with a neutral
8639: air.
8640: 
8641: “The sketch must be very grand, if it conveys so much,” said Dorothea.
8642: “I should need some explanation even of the meaning you give. Do you
8643: intend Tamburlaine to represent earthquakes and volcanoes?”
8644: 
8645: “Oh yes,” said Will, laughing, “and migrations of races and clearings
8646: of forests—and America and the steam-engine. Everything you can
8647: imagine!”
8648: 
8649: “What a difficult kind of shorthand!” said Dorothea, smiling towards
8650: her husband. “It would require all your knowledge to be able to read
8651: it.”
8652: 
8653: Mr. Casaubon blinked furtively at Will. He had a suspicion that he was
8654: being laughed at. But it was not possible to include Dorothea in the
8655: suspicion.
8656: 
8657: They found Naumann painting industriously, but no model was present;
8658: his pictures were advantageously arranged, and his own plain vivacious
8659: person set off by a dove-colored blouse and a maroon velvet cap, so
8660: that everything was as fortunate as if he had expected the beautiful
8661: young English lady exactly at that time.
8662: 
8663: The painter in his confident English gave little dissertations on his
8664: finished and unfinished subjects, seeming to observe Mr. Casaubon as
8665: much as he did Dorothea. Will burst in here and there with ardent words
8666: of praise, marking out particular merits in his friend’s work; and
8667: Dorothea felt that she was getting quite new notions as to the
8668: significance of Madonnas seated under inexplicable canopied thrones
8669: with the simple country as a background, and of saints with
8670: architectural models in their hands, or knives accidentally wedged in
8671: their skulls. Some things which had seemed monstrous to her were
8672: gathering intelligibility and even a natural meaning: but all this was
8673: apparently a branch of knowledge in which Mr. Casaubon had not
8674: interested himself.
8675: 
8676: “I think I would rather feel that painting is beautiful than have to
8677: read it as an enigma; but I should learn to understand these pictures
8678: sooner than yours with the very wide meaning,” said Dorothea, speaking
8679: to Will.
8680: 
8681: “Don’t speak of my painting before Naumann,” said Will. “He will tell
8682: you, it is all _pfuscherei_, which is his most opprobrious word!”
8683: 
8684: “Is that true?” said Dorothea, turning her sincere eyes on Naumann, who
8685: made a slight grimace and said—
8686: 
8687: “Oh, he does not mean it seriously with painting. His walk must be
8688: _belles-lettres_. That is wi-ide.”
8689: 
8690: Naumann’s pronunciation of the vowel seemed to stretch the word
8691: satirically. Will did not half like it, but managed to laugh: and Mr.
8692: Casaubon, while he felt some disgust at the artist’s German accent,
8693: began to entertain a little respect for his judicious severity.
8694: 
8695: The respect was not diminished when Naumann, after drawing Will aside
8696: for a moment and looking, first at a large canvas, then at Mr.
8697: Casaubon, came forward again and said—
8698: 
8699: “My friend Ladislaw thinks you will pardon me, sir, if I say that a
8700: sketch of your head would be invaluable to me for the St. Thomas
8701: Aquinas in my picture there. It is too much to ask; but I so seldom see
8702: just what I want—the idealistic in the real.”
8703: 
8704: “You astonish me greatly, sir,” said Mr. Casaubon, his looks improved
8705: with a glow of delight; “but if my poor physiognomy, which I have been
8706: accustomed to regard as of the commonest order, can be of any use to
8707: you in furnishing some traits for the angelical doctor, I shall feel
8708: honored. That is to say, if the operation will not be a lengthy one;
8709: and if Mrs. Casaubon will not object to the delay.”
8710: 
8711: As for Dorothea, nothing could have pleased her more, unless it had
8712: been a miraculous voice pronouncing Mr. Casaubon the wisest and
8713: worthiest among the sons of men. In that case her tottering faith would
8714: have become firm again.
8715: 
8716: Naumann’s apparatus was at hand in wonderful completeness, and the
8717: sketch went on at once as well as the conversation. Dorothea sat down
8718: and subsided into calm silence, feeling happier than she had done for a
8719: long while before. Every one about her seemed good, and she said to
8720: herself that Rome, if she had only been less ignorant, would have been
8721: full of beauty: its sadness would have been winged with hope. No nature
8722: could be less suspicious than hers: when she was a child she believed
8723: in the gratitude of wasps and the honorable susceptibility of sparrows,
8724: and was proportionately indignant when their baseness was made
8725: manifest.
8726: 
8727: The adroit artist was asking Mr. Casaubon questions about English
8728: polities, which brought long answers, and, Will meanwhile had perched
8729: himself on some steps in the background overlooking all.
8730: 
8731: Presently Naumann said—“Now if I could lay this by for half an hour and
8732: take it up again—come and look, Ladislaw—I think it is perfect so far.”
8733: 
8734: Will vented those adjuring interjections which imply that admiration is
8735: too strong for syntax; and Naumann said in a tone of piteous regret—
8736: 
8737: “Ah—now—if I could but have had more—but you have other engagements—I
8738: could not ask it—or even to come again to-morrow.”
8739: 
8740: “Oh, let us stay!” said Dorothea. “We have nothing to do to-day except
8741: go about, have we?” she added, looking entreatingly at Mr. Casaubon.
8742: “It would be a pity not to make the head as good as possible.”
8743: 
8744: “I am at your service, sir, in the matter,” said Mr. Casaubon, with
8745: polite condescension. “Having given up the interior of my head to
8746: idleness, it is as well that the exterior should work in this way.”
8747: 
8748: “You are unspeakably good—now I am happy!” said Naumann, and then went
8749: on in German to Will, pointing here and there to the sketch as if he
8750: were considering that. Putting it aside for a moment, he looked round
8751: vaguely, as if seeking some occupation for his visitors, and afterwards
8752: turning to Mr. Casaubon, said—
8753: 
8754: “Perhaps the beautiful bride, the gracious lady, would not be unwilling
8755: to let me fill up the time by trying to make a slight sketch of
8756: her—not, of course, as you see, for that picture—only as a single
8757: study.”
8758: 
8759: Mr. Casaubon, bowing, doubted not that Mrs. Casaubon would oblige him,
8760: and Dorothea said, at once, “Where shall I put myself?”
8761: 
8762: Naumann was all apologies in asking her to stand, and allow him to
8763: adjust her attitude, to which she submitted without any of the affected
8764: airs and laughs frequently thought necessary on such occasions, when
8765: the painter said, “It is as Santa Clara that I want you to
8766: stand—leaning so, with your cheek against your hand—so—looking at that
8767: stool, please, so!”
8768: 
8769: Will was divided between the inclination to fall at the Saint’s feet
8770: and kiss her robe, and the temptation to knock Naumann down while he
8771: was adjusting her arm. All this was impudence and desecration, and he
8772: repented that he had brought her.
8773: 
8774: The artist was diligent, and Will recovering himself moved about and
8775: occupied Mr. Casaubon as ingeniously as he could; but he did not in the
8776: end prevent the time from seeming long to that gentleman, as was clear
8777: from his expressing a fear that Mrs. Casaubon would be tired. Naumann
8778: took the hint and said—
8779: 
8780: “Now, sir, if you can oblige me again; I will release the lady-wife.”
8781: 
8782: So Mr. Casaubon’s patience held out further, and when after all it
8783: turned out that the head of Saint Thomas Aquinas would be more perfect
8784: if another sitting could be had, it was granted for the morrow. On the
8785: morrow Santa Clara too was retouched more than once. The result of all
8786: was so far from displeasing to Mr. Casaubon, that he arranged for the
8787: purchase of the picture in which Saint Thomas Aquinas sat among the
8788: doctors of the Church in a disputation too abstract to be represented,
8789: but listened to with more or less attention by an audience above. The
8790: Santa Clara, which was spoken of in the second place, Naumann declared
8791: himself to be dissatisfied with—he could not, in conscience, engage to
8792: make a worthy picture of it; so about the Santa Clara the arrangement
8793: was conditional.
8794: 
8795: I will not dwell on Naumann’s jokes at the expense of Mr. Casaubon that
8796: evening, or on his dithyrambs about Dorothea’s charm, in all which Will
8797: joined, but with a difference. No sooner did Naumann mention any detail
8798: of Dorothea’s beauty, than Will got exasperated at his presumption:
8799: there was grossness in his choice of the most ordinary words, and what
8800: business had he to talk of her lips? She was not a woman to be spoken
8801: of as other women were. Will could not say just what he thought, but he
8802: became irritable. And yet, when after some resistance he had consented
8803: to take the Casaubons to his friend’s studio, he had been allured by
8804: the gratification of his pride in being the person who could grant
8805: Naumann such an opportunity of studying her loveliness—or rather her
8806: divineness, for the ordinary phrases which might apply to mere bodily
8807: prettiness were not applicable to her. (Certainly all Tipton and its
8808: neighborhood, as well as Dorothea herself, would have been surprised at
8809: her beauty being made so much of. In that part of the world Miss Brooke
8810: had been only a “fine young woman.”)
8811: 
8812: “Oblige me by letting the subject drop, Naumann. Mrs. Casaubon is not
8813: to be talked of as if she were a model,” said Will. Naumann stared at
8814: him.
8815: 
8816: “Schön! I will talk of my Aquinas. The head is not a bad type, after
8817: all. I dare say the great scholastic himself would have been flattered
8818: to have his portrait asked for. Nothing like these starchy doctors for
8819: vanity! It was as I thought: he cared much less for her portrait than
8820: his own.”
8821: 
8822: “He’s a cursed white-blooded pedantic coxcomb,” said Will, with
8823: gnashing impetuosity. His obligations to Mr. Casaubon were not known to
8824: his hearer, but Will himself was thinking of them, and wishing that he
8825: could discharge them all by a check.
8826: 
8827: Naumann gave a shrug and said, “It is good they go away soon, my dear.
8828: They are spoiling your fine temper.”
8829: 
8830: All Will’s hope and contrivance were now concentrated on seeing
8831: Dorothea when she was alone. He only wanted her to take more emphatic
8832: notice of him; he only wanted to be something more special in her
8833: remembrance than he could yet believe himself likely to be. He was
8834: rather impatient under that open ardent good-will, which he saw was her
8835: usual state of feeling. The remote worship of a woman throned out of
8836: their reach plays a great part in men’s lives, but in most cases the
8837: worshipper longs for some queenly recognition, some approving sign by
8838: which his soul’s sovereign may cheer him without descending from her
8839: high place. That was precisely what Will wanted. But there were plenty
8840: of contradictions in his imaginative demands. It was beautiful to see
8841: how Dorothea’s eyes turned with wifely anxiety and beseeching to Mr.
8842: Casaubon: she would have lost some of her halo if she had been without
8843: that duteous preoccupation; and yet at the next moment the husband’s
8844: sandy absorption of such nectar was too intolerable; and Will’s longing
8845: to say damaging things about him was perhaps not the less tormenting
8846: because he felt the strongest reasons for restraining it.
8847: 
8848: Will had not been invited to dine the next day. Hence he persuaded
8849: himself that he was bound to call, and that the only eligible time was
8850: the middle of the day, when Mr. Casaubon would not be at home.
8851: 
8852: Dorothea, who had not been made aware that her former reception of Will
8853: had displeased her husband, had no hesitation about seeing him,
8854: especially as he might be come to pay a farewell visit. When he entered
8855: she was looking at some cameos which she had been buying for Celia. She
8856: greeted Will as if his visit were quite a matter of course, and said at
8857: once, having a cameo bracelet in her hand—
8858: 
8859: “I am so glad you are come. Perhaps you understand all about cameos,
8860: and can tell me if these are really good. I wished to have you with us
8861: in choosing them, but Mr. Casaubon objected: he thought there was not
8862: time. He will finish his work to-morrow, and we shall go away in three
8863: days. I have been uneasy about these cameos. Pray sit down and look at
8864: them.”
8865: 
8866: “I am not particularly knowing, but there can be no great mistake about
8867: these little Homeric bits: they are exquisitely neat. And the color is
8868: fine: it will just suit you.”
8869: 
8870: “Oh, they are for my sister, who has quite a different complexion. You
8871: saw her with me at Lowick: she is light-haired and very pretty—at least
8872: I think so. We were never so long away from each other in our lives
8873: before. She is a great pet and never was naughty in her life. I found
8874: out before I came away that she wanted me to buy her some cameos, and I
8875: should be sorry for them not to be good—after their kind.” Dorothea
8876: added the last words with a smile.
8877: 
8878: “You seem not to care about cameos,” said Will, seating himself at some
8879: distance from her, and observing her while she closed the cases.
8880: 
8881: “No, frankly, I don’t think them a great object in life,” said
8882: Dorothea.
8883: 
8884: “I fear you are a heretic about art generally. How is that? I should
8885: have expected you to be very sensitive to the beautiful everywhere.”
8886: 
8887: “I suppose I am dull about many things,” said Dorothea, simply. “I
8888: should like to make life beautiful—I mean everybody’s life. And then
8889: all this immense expense of art, that seems somehow to lie outside life
8890: and make it no better for the world, pains one. It spoils my enjoyment
8891: of anything when I am made to think that most people are shut out from
8892: it.”
8893: 
8894: “I call that the fanaticism of sympathy,” said Will, impetuously. “You
8895: might say the same of landscape, of poetry, of all refinement. If you
8896: carried it out you ought to be miserable in your own goodness, and turn
8897: evil that you might have no advantage over others. The best piety is to
8898: enjoy—when you can. You are doing the most then to save the earth’s
8899: character as an agreeable planet. And enjoyment radiates. It is of no
8900: use to try and take care of all the world; that is being taken care of
8901: when you feel delight—in art or in anything else. Would you turn all
8902: the youth of the world into a tragic chorus, wailing and moralizing
8903: over misery? I suspect that you have some false belief in the virtues
8904: of misery, and want to make your life a martyrdom.” Will had gone
8905: further than he intended, and checked himself. But Dorothea’s thought
8906: was not taking just the same direction as his own, and she answered
8907: without any special emotion—
8908: 
8909: “Indeed you mistake me. I am not a sad, melancholy creature. I am never
8910: unhappy long together. I am angry and naughty—not like Celia: I have a
8911: great outburst, and then all seems glorious again. I cannot help
8912: believing in glorious things in a blind sort of way. I should be quite
8913: willing to enjoy the art here, but there is so much that I don’t know
8914: the reason of—so much that seems to me a consecration of ugliness
8915: rather than beauty. The painting and sculpture may be wonderful, but
8916: the feeling is often low and brutal, and sometimes even ridiculous.
8917: Here and there I see what takes me at once as noble—something that I
8918: might compare with the Alban Mountains or the sunset from the Pincian
8919: Hill; but that makes it the greater pity that there is so little of the
8920: best kind among all that mass of things over which men have toiled so.”
8921: 
8922: “Of course there is always a great deal of poor work: the rarer things
8923: want that soil to grow in.”
8924: 
8925: “Oh dear,” said Dorothea, taking up that thought into the chief current
8926: of her anxiety; “I see it must be very difficult to do anything good. I
8927: have often felt since I have been in Rome that most of our lives would
8928: look much uglier and more bungling than the pictures, if they could be
8929: put on the wall.”
8930: 
8931: Dorothea parted her lips again as if she were going to say more, but
8932: changed her mind and paused.
8933: 
8934: “You are too young—it is an anachronism for you to have such thoughts,”
8935: said Will, energetically, with a quick shake of the head habitual to
8936: him. “You talk as if you had never known any youth. It is monstrous—as
8937: if you had had a vision of Hades in your childhood, like the boy in the
8938: legend. You have been brought up in some of those horrible notions that
8939: choose the sweetest women to devour—like Minotaurs. And now you will go
8940: and be shut up in that stone prison at Lowick: you will be buried
8941: alive. It makes me savage to think of it! I would rather never have
8942: seen you than think of you with such a prospect.”
8943: 
8944: Will again feared that he had gone too far; but the meaning we attach
8945: to words depends on our feeling, and his tone of angry regret had so
8946: much kindness in it for Dorothea’s heart, which had always been giving
8947: out ardor and had never been fed with much from the living beings
8948: around her, that she felt a new sense of gratitude and answered with a
8949: gentle smile—
8950: 
8951: “It is very good of you to be anxious about me. It is because you did
8952: not like Lowick yourself: you had set your heart on another kind of
8953: life. But Lowick is my chosen home.”
8954: 
8955: The last sentence was spoken with an almost solemn cadence, and Will
8956: did not know what to say, since it would not be useful for him to
8957: embrace her slippers, and tell her that he would die for her: it was
8958: clear that she required nothing of the sort; and they were both silent
8959: for a moment or two, when Dorothea began again with an air of saying at
8960: last what had been in her mind beforehand.
8961: 
8962: “I wanted to ask you again about something you said the other day.
8963: Perhaps it was half of it your lively way of speaking: I notice that
8964: you like to put things strongly; I myself often exaggerate when I speak
8965: hastily.”
8966: 
8967: “What was it?” said Will, observing that she spoke with a timidity
8968: quite new in her. “I have a hyperbolical tongue: it catches fire as it
8969: goes. I dare say I shall have to retract.”
8970: 
8971: “I mean what you said about the necessity of knowing German—I mean, for
8972: the subjects that Mr. Casaubon is engaged in. I have been thinking
8973: about it; and it seems to me that with Mr. Casaubon’s learning he must
8974: have before him the same materials as German scholars—has he not?”
8975: Dorothea’s timidity was due to an indistinct consciousness that she was
8976: in the strange situation of consulting a third person about the
8977: adequacy of Mr. Casaubon’s learning.
8978: 
8979: “Not exactly the same materials,” said Will, thinking that he would be
8980: duly reserved. “He is not an Orientalist, you know. He does not profess
8981: to have more than second-hand knowledge there.”
8982: 
8983: “But there are very valuable books about antiquities which were written
8984: a long while ago by scholars who knew nothing about these modern
8985: things; and they are still used. Why should Mr. Casaubon’s not be
8986: valuable, like theirs?” said Dorothea, with more remonstrant energy.
8987: She was impelled to have the argument aloud, which she had been having
8988: in her own mind.
8989: 
8990: “That depends on the line of study taken,” said Will, also getting a
8991: tone of rejoinder. “The subject Mr. Casaubon has chosen is as changing
8992: as chemistry: new discoveries are constantly making new points of view.
8993: Who wants a system on the basis of the four elements, or a book to
8994: refute Paracelsus? Do you not see that it is no use now to be crawling
8995: a little way after men of the last century—men like Bryant—and
8996: correcting their mistakes?—living in a lumber-room and furbishing up
8997: broken-legged theories about Chus and Mizraim?”
8998: 
8999: “How can you bear to speak so lightly?” said Dorothea, with a look
9000: between sorrow and anger. “If it were as you say, what could be sadder
9001: than so much ardent labor all in vain? I wonder it does not affect you
9002: more painfully, if you really think that a man like Mr. Casaubon, of so
9003: much goodness, power, and learning, should in any way fail in what has
9004: been the labor of his best years.” She was beginning to be shocked that
9005: she had got to such a point of supposition, and indignant with Will for
9006: having led her to it.
9007: 
9008: “You questioned me about the matter of fact, not of feeling,” said
9009: Will. “But if you wish to punish me for the fact, I submit. I am not in
9010: a position to express my feeling toward Mr. Casaubon: it would be at
9011: best a pensioner’s eulogy.”
9012: 
9013: “Pray excuse me,” said Dorothea, coloring deeply. “I am aware, as you
9014: say, that I am in fault in having introduced the subject. Indeed, I am
9015: wrong altogether. Failure after long perseverance is much grander than
9016: never to have a striving good enough to be called a failure.”
9017: 
9018: “I quite agree with you,” said Will, determined to change the
9019: situation—“so much so that I have made up my mind not to run that risk
9020: of never attaining a failure. Mr. Casaubon’s generosity has perhaps
9021: been dangerous to me, and I mean to renounce the liberty it has given
9022: me. I mean to go back to England shortly and work my own way—depend on
9023: nobody else than myself.”
9024: 
9025: “That is fine—I respect that feeling,” said Dorothea, with returning
9026: kindness. “But Mr. Casaubon, I am sure, has never thought of anything
9027: in the matter except what was most for your welfare.”
9028: 
9029: “She has obstinacy and pride enough to serve instead of love, now she
9030: has married him,” said Will to himself. Aloud he said, rising—
9031: 
9032: “I shall not see you again.”
9033: 
9034: “Oh, stay till Mr. Casaubon comes,” said Dorothea, earnestly. “I am so
9035: glad we met in Rome. I wanted to know you.”
9036: 
9037: “And I have made you angry,” said Will. “I have made you think ill of
9038: me.”
9039: 
9040: “Oh no. My sister tells me I am always angry with people who do not say
9041: just what I like. But I hope I am not given to think ill of them. In
9042: the end I am usually obliged to think ill of myself for being so
9043: impatient.”
9044: 
9045: “Still, you don’t like me; I have made myself an unpleasant thought to
9046: you.”
9047: 
9048: “Not at all,” said Dorothea, with the most open kindness. “I like you
9049: very much.”
9050: 
9051: Will was not quite contented, thinking that he would apparently have
9052: been of more importance if he had been disliked. He said nothing, but
9053: looked dull, not to say sulky.
9054: 
9055: “And I am quite interested to see what you will do,” Dorothea went on
9056: cheerfully. “I believe devoutly in a natural difference of vocation. If
9057: it were not for that belief, I suppose I should be very narrow—there
9058: are so many things, besides painting, that I am quite ignorant of. You
9059: would hardly believe how little I have taken in of music and
9060: literature, which you know so much of. I wonder what your vocation will
9061: turn out to be: perhaps you will be a poet?”
9062: 
9063: “That depends. To be a poet is to have a soul so quick to discern that
9064: no shade of quality escapes it, and so quick to feel, that discernment
9065: is but a hand playing with finely ordered variety on the chords of
9066: emotion—a soul in which knowledge passes instantaneously into feeling,
9067: and feeling flashes back as a new organ of knowledge. One may have that
9068: condition by fits only.”
9069: 
9070: “But you leave out the poems,” said Dorothea. “I think they are wanted
9071: to complete the poet. I understand what you mean about knowledge
9072: passing into feeling, for that seems to be just what I experience. But
9073: I am sure I could never produce a poem.”
9074: 
9075: “You _are_ a poem—and that is to be the best part of a poet—what makes
9076: up the poet’s consciousness in his best moods,” said Will, showing such
9077: originality as we all share with the morning and the spring-time and
9078: other endless renewals.
9079: 
9080: “I am very glad to hear it,” said Dorothea, laughing out her words in a
9081: bird-like modulation, and looking at Will with playful gratitude in her
9082: eyes. “What very kind things you say to me!”
9083: 
9084: “I wish I could ever do anything that would be what you call kind—that
9085: I could ever be of the slightest service to you. I fear I shall never
9086: have the opportunity.” Will spoke with fervor.
9087: 
9088: “Oh yes,” said Dorothea, cordially. “It will come; and I shall remember
9089: how well you wish me. I quite hoped that we should be friends when I
9090: first saw you—because of your relationship to Mr. Casaubon.” There was
9091: a certain liquid brightness in her eyes, and Will was conscious that
9092: his own were obeying a law of nature and filling too. The allusion to
9093: Mr. Casaubon would have spoiled all if anything at that moment could
9094: have spoiled the subduing power, the sweet dignity, of her noble
9095: unsuspicious inexperience.
9096: 
9097: “And there is one thing even now that you can do,” said Dorothea,
9098: rising and walking a little way under the strength of a recurring
9099: impulse. “Promise me that you will not again, to any one, speak of that
9100: subject—I mean about Mr. Casaubon’s writings—I mean in that kind of
9101: way. It was I who led to it. It was my fault. But promise me.”
9102: 
9103: She had returned from her brief pacing and stood opposite Will, looking
9104: gravely at him.
9105: 
9106: “Certainly, I will promise you,” said Will, reddening however. If he
9107: never said a cutting word about Mr. Casaubon again and left off
9108: receiving favors from him, it would clearly be permissible to hate him
9109: the more. The poet must know how to hate, says Goethe; and Will was at
9110: least ready with that accomplishment. He said that he must go now
9111: without waiting for Mr. Casaubon, whom he would come to take leave of
9112: at the last moment. Dorothea gave him her hand, and they exchanged a
9113: simple “Good-by.”
9114: 
9115: But going out of the _porte cochere_ he met Mr. Casaubon, and that
9116: gentleman, expressing the best wishes for his cousin, politely waived
9117: the pleasure of any further leave-taking on the morrow, which would be
9118: sufficiently crowded with the preparations for departure.
9119: 
9120: “I have something to tell you about our cousin Mr. Ladislaw, which I
9121: think will heighten your opinion of him,” said Dorothea to her husband
9122: in the course of the evening. She had mentioned immediately on his
9123: entering that Will had just gone away, and would come again, but Mr.
9124: Casaubon had said, “I met him outside, and we made our final adieux, I
9125: believe,” saying this with the air and tone by which we imply that any
9126: subject, whether private or public, does not interest us enough to wish
9127: for a further remark upon it. So Dorothea had waited.
9128: 
9129: “What is that, my love?” said Mr Casaubon (he always said “my love”
9130: when his manner was the coldest).
9131: 
9132: “He has made up his mind to leave off wandering at once, and to give up
9133: his dependence on your generosity. He means soon to go back to England,
9134: and work his own way. I thought you would consider that a good sign,”
9135: said Dorothea, with an appealing look into her husband’s neutral face.
9136: 
9137: “Did he mention the precise order of occupation to which he would
9138: addict himself?”
9139: 
9140: “No. But he said that he felt the danger which lay for him in your
9141: generosity. Of course he will write to you about it. Do you not think
9142: better of him for his resolve?”
9143: 
9144: “I shall await his communication on the subject,” said Mr. Casaubon.
9145: 
9146: “I told him I was sure that the thing you considered in all you did for
9147: him was his own welfare. I remembered your goodness in what you said
9148: about him when I first saw him at Lowick,” said Dorothea, putting her
9149: hand on her husband’s.

9151: “I had a duty towards him,” said Mr. Casaubon, laying his other hand on
9152: Dorothea’s in conscientious acceptance of her caress, but with a glance
9153: which he could not hinder from being uneasy. “The young man, I confess,
9154: is not otherwise an object of interest to me, nor need we, I think,
9155: discuss his future course, which it is not ours to determine beyond the
9156: limits which I have sufficiently indicated.” Dorothea did not mention
9157: Will again.

9169: 
9170: “Your horses of the Sun,” he said,
9171:     “And first-rate whip Apollo!
9172: Whate’er they be, I’ll eat my head,
9173:     But I will beat them hollow.”
9174: 
9175: 
9176: Fred Vincy, we have seen, had a debt on his mind, and though no such
9177: immaterial burthen could depress that buoyant-hearted young gentleman
9178: for many hours together, there were circumstances connected with this
9179: debt which made the thought of it unusually importunate. The creditor
9180: was Mr. Bambridge, a horse-dealer of the neighborhood, whose company
9181: was much sought in Middlemarch by young men understood to be “addicted
9182: to pleasure.” During the vacations Fred had naturally required more
9183: amusements than he had ready money for, and Mr. Bambridge had been
9184: accommodating enough not only to trust him for the hire of horses and
9185: the accidental expense of ruining a fine hunter, but also to make a
9186: small advance by which he might be able to meet some losses at
9187: billiards. The total debt was a hundred and sixty pounds. Bambridge was
9188: in no alarm about his money, being sure that young Vincy had backers;
9189: but he had required something to show for it, and Fred had at first
9190: given a bill with his own signature. Three months later he had renewed
9191: this bill with the signature of Caleb Garth. On both occasions Fred had
9192: felt confident that he should meet the bill himself, having ample funds
9193: at disposal in his own hopefulness. You will hardly demand that his
9194: confidence should have a basis in external facts; such confidence, we
9195: know, is something less coarse and materialistic: it is a comfortable
9196: disposition leading us to expect that the wisdom of providence or the
9197: folly of our friends, the mysteries of luck or the still greater
9198: mystery of our high individual value in the universe, will bring about
9199: agreeable issues, such as are consistent with our good taste in
9200: costume, and our general preference for the best style of thing. Fred
9201: felt sure that he should have a present from his uncle, that he should
9202: have a run of luck, that by dint of “swapping” he should gradually
9203: metamorphose a horse worth forty pounds into a horse that would fetch a
9204: hundred at any moment—“judgment” being always equivalent to an
9205: unspecified sum in hard cash. And in any case, even supposing negations
9206: which only a morbid distrust could imagine, Fred had always (at that
9207: time) his father’s pocket as a last resource, so that his assets of
9208: hopefulness had a sort of gorgeous superfluity about them. Of what
9209: might be the capacity of his father’s pocket, Fred had only a vague
9210: notion: was not trade elastic? And would not the deficiencies of one
9211: year be made up for by the surplus of another? The Vincys lived in an
9212: easy profuse way, not with any new ostentation, but according to the
9213: family habits and traditions, so that the children had no standard of
9214: economy, and the elder ones retained some of their infantine notion
9215: that their father might pay for anything if he would. Mr. Vincy himself
9216: had expensive Middlemarch habits—spent money on coursing, on his
9217: cellar, and on dinner-giving, while mamma had those running accounts
9218: with tradespeople, which give a cheerful sense of getting everything
9219: one wants without any question of payment. But it was in the nature of
9220: fathers, Fred knew, to bully one about expenses: there was always a
9221: little storm over his extravagance if he had to disclose a debt, and
9222: Fred disliked bad weather within doors. He was too filial to be
9223: disrespectful to his father, and he bore the thunder with the certainty
9224: that it was transient; but in the mean time it was disagreeable to see
9225: his mother cry, and also to be obliged to look sulky instead of having
9226: fun; for Fred was so good-tempered that if he looked glum under
9227: scolding, it was chiefly for propriety’s sake. The easier course
9228: plainly, was to renew the bill with a friend’s signature. Why not? With
9229: the superfluous securities of hope at his command, there was no reason
9230: why he should not have increased other people’s liabilities to any
9231: extent, but for the fact that men whose names were good for anything
9232: were usually pessimists, indisposed to believe that the universal order
9233: of things would necessarily be agreeable to an agreeable young
9234: gentleman.
9235: 
9236: With a favor to ask we review our list of friends, do justice to their
9237: more amiable qualities, forgive their little offenses, and concerning
9238: each in turn, try to arrive at the conclusion that he will be eager to
9239: oblige us, our own eagerness to be obliged being as communicable as
9240: other warmth. Still there is always a certain number who are dismissed
9241: as but moderately eager until the others have refused; and it happened
9242: that Fred checked off all his friends but one, on the ground that
9243: applying to them would be disagreeable; being implicitly convinced that
9244: he at least (whatever might be maintained about mankind generally) had
9245: a right to be free from anything disagreeable. That he should ever fall
9246: into a thoroughly unpleasant position—wear trousers shrunk with
9247: washing, eat cold mutton, have to walk for want of a horse, or to “duck
9248: under” in any sort of way—was an absurdity irreconcilable with those
9249: cheerful intuitions implanted in him by nature. And Fred winced under
9250: the idea of being looked down upon as wanting funds for small debts.
9251: Thus it came to pass that the friend whom he chose to apply to was at
9252: once the poorest and the kindest—namely, Caleb Garth.
9253: 
9254: The Garths were very fond of Fred, as he was of them; for when he and
9255: Rosamond were little ones, and the Garths were better off, the slight
9256: connection between the two families through Mr. Featherstone’s double
9257: marriage (the first to Mr. Garth’s sister, and the second to Mrs.
9258: Vincy’s) had led to an acquaintance which was carried on between the
9259: children rather than the parents: the children drank tea together out
9260: of their toy teacups, and spent whole days together in play. Mary was a
9261: little hoyden, and Fred at six years old thought her the nicest girl in
9262: the world, making her his wife with a brass ring which he had cut from
9263: an umbrella. Through all the stages of his education he had kept his
9264: affection for the Garths, and his habit of going to their house as a
9265: second home, though any intercourse between them and the elders of his
9266: family had long ceased. Even when Caleb Garth was prosperous, the
9267: Vincys were on condescending terms with him and his wife, for there
9268: were nice distinctions of rank in Middlemarch; and though old
9269: manufacturers could not any more than dukes be connected with none but
9270: equals, they were conscious of an inherent social superiority which was
9271: defined with great nicety in practice, though hardly expressible
9272: theoretically. Since then Mr. Garth had failed in the building
9273: business, which he had unfortunately added to his other avocations of
9274: surveyor, valuer, and agent, had conducted that business for a time
9275: entirely for the benefit of his assignees, and had been living
9276: narrowly, exerting himself to the utmost that he might after all pay
9277: twenty shillings in the pound. He had now achieved this, and from all
9278: who did not think it a bad precedent, his honorable exertions had won
9279: him due esteem; but in no part of the world is genteel visiting founded
9280: on esteem, in the absence of suitable furniture and complete
9281: dinner-service. Mrs. Vincy had never been at her ease with Mrs. Garth,
9282: and frequently spoke of her as a woman who had had to work for her
9283: bread—meaning that Mrs. Garth had been a teacher before her marriage;
9284: in which case an intimacy with Lindley Murray and Mangnall’s Questions
9285: was something like a draper’s discrimination of calico trademarks, or a
9286: courier’s acquaintance with foreign countries: no woman who was better
9287: off needed that sort of thing. And since Mary had been keeping Mr.
9288: Featherstone’s house, Mrs. Vincy’s want of liking for the Garths had
9289: been converted into something more positive, by alarm lest Fred should
9290: engage himself to this plain girl, whose parents “lived in such a small
9291: way.” Fred, being aware of this, never spoke at home of his visits to
9292: Mrs. Garth, which had of late become more frequent, the increasing
9293: ardor of his affection for Mary inclining him the more towards those
9294: who belonged to her.
9295: 
9296: Mr. Garth had a small office in the town, and to this Fred went with
9297: his request. He obtained it without much difficulty, for a large amount
9298: of painful experience had not sufficed to make Caleb Garth cautious
9299: about his own affairs, or distrustful of his fellow-men when they had
9300: not proved themselves untrustworthy; and he had the highest opinion of
9301: Fred, was “sure the lad would turn out well—an open affectionate
9302: fellow, with a good bottom to his character—you might trust him for
9303: anything.” Such was Caleb’s psychological argument. He was one of those
9304: rare men who are rigid to themselves and indulgent to others. He had a
9305: certain shame about his neighbors’ errors, and never spoke of them
9306: willingly; hence he was not likely to divert his mind from the best
9307: mode of hardening timber and other ingenious devices in order to
9308: preconceive those errors. If he had to blame any one, it was necessary
9309: for him to move all the papers within his reach, or describe various
9310: diagrams with his stick, or make calculations with the odd money in his
9311: pocket, before he could begin; and he would rather do other men’s work
9312: than find fault with their doing. I fear he was a bad disciplinarian.
9313: 
9314: When Fred stated the circumstances of his debt, his wish to meet it
9315: without troubling his father, and the certainty that the money would be
9316: forthcoming so as to cause no one any inconvenience, Caleb pushed his
9317: spectacles upward, listened, looked into his favorite’s clear young
9318: eyes, and believed him, not distinguishing confidence about the future
9319: from veracity about the past; but he felt that it was an occasion for a
9320: friendly hint as to conduct, and that before giving his signature he
9321: must give a rather strong admonition. Accordingly, he took the paper
9322: and lowered his spectacles, measured the space at his command, reached
9323: his pen and examined it, dipped it in the ink and examined it again,
9324: then pushed the paper a little way from him, lifted up his spectacles
9325: again, showed a deepened depression in the outer angle of his bushy
9326: eyebrows, which gave his face a peculiar mildness (pardon these details
9327: for once—you would have learned to love them if you had known Caleb
9328: Garth), and said in a comfortable tone,—
9329: 
9330: “It was a misfortune, eh, that breaking the horse’s knees? And then,
9331: these exchanges, they don’t answer when you have ’cute jockeys to deal
9332: with. You’ll be wiser another time, my boy.”
9333: 
9334: Whereupon Caleb drew down his spectacles, and proceeded to write his
9335: signature with the care which he always gave to that performance; for
9336: whatever he did in the way of business he did well. He contemplated the
9337: large well-proportioned letters and final flourish, with his head a
9338: trifle on one side for an instant, then handed it to Fred, said
9339: “Good-by,” and returned forthwith to his absorption in a plan for Sir
9340: James Chettam’s new farm-buildings.
9341: 
9342: Either because his interest in this work thrust the incident of the
9343: signature from his memory, or for some reason of which Caleb was more
9344: conscious, Mrs. Garth remained ignorant of the affair.
9345: 
9346: Since it occurred, a change had come over Fred’s sky, which altered his
9347: view of the distance, and was the reason why his uncle Featherstone’s
9348: present of money was of importance enough to make his color come and
9349: go, first with a too definite expectation, and afterwards with a
9350: proportionate disappointment. His failure in passing his examination,
9351: had made his accumulation of college debts the more unpardonable by his
9352: father, and there had been an unprecedented storm at home. Mr. Vincy
9353: had sworn that if he had anything more of that sort to put up with,
9354: Fred should turn out and get his living how he could; and he had never
9355: yet quite recovered his good-humored tone to his son, who had
9356: especially enraged him by saying at this stage of things that he did
9357: not want to be a clergyman, and would rather not “go on with that.”
9358: Fred was conscious that he would have been yet more severely dealt with
9359: if his family as well as himself had not secretly regarded him as Mr.
9360: Featherstone’s heir; that old gentleman’s pride in him, and apparent
9361: fondness for him, serving in the stead of more exemplary conduct—just
9362: as when a youthful nobleman steals jewellery we call the act
9363: kleptomania, speak of it with a philosophical smile, and never think of
9364: his being sent to the house of correction as if he were a ragged boy
9365: who had stolen turnips. In fact, tacit expectations of what would be
9366: done for him by uncle Featherstone determined the angle at which most
9367: people viewed Fred Vincy in Middlemarch; and in his own consciousness,
9368: what uncle Featherstone would do for him in an emergency, or what he
9369: would do simply as an incorporated luck, formed always an immeasurable
9370: depth of aerial perspective. But that present of bank-notes, once made,
9371: was measurable, and being applied to the amount of the debt, showed a
9372: deficit which had still to be filled up either by Fred’s “judgment” or
9373: by luck in some other shape. For that little episode of the alleged
9374: borrowing, in which he had made his father the agent in getting the
9375: Bulstrode certificate, was a new reason against going to his father for
9376: money towards meeting his actual debt. Fred was keen enough to foresee
9377: that anger would confuse distinctions, and that his denial of having
9378: borrowed expressly on the strength of his uncle’s will would be taken
9379: as a falsehood. He had gone to his father and told him one vexatious
9380: affair, and he had left another untold: in such cases the complete
9381: revelation always produces the impression of a previous duplicity. Now
9382: Fred piqued himself on keeping clear of lies, and even fibs; he often
9383: shrugged his shoulders and made a significant grimace at what he called
9384: Rosamond’s fibs (it is only brothers who can associate such ideas with
9385: a lovely girl); and rather than incur the accusation of falsehood he
9386: would even incur some trouble and self-restraint. It was under strong
9387: inward pressure of this kind that Fred had taken the wise step of
9388: depositing the eighty pounds with his mother. It was a pity that he had
9389: not at once given them to Mr. Garth; but he meant to make the sum
9390: complete with another sixty, and with a view to this, he had kept
9391: twenty pounds in his own pocket as a sort of seed-corn, which, planted
9392: by judgment, and watered by luck, might yield more than threefold—a
9393: very poor rate of multiplication when the field is a young gentleman’s
9394: infinite soul, with all the numerals at command.
9395: 
9396: Fred was not a gambler: he had not that specific disease in which the
9397: suspension of the whole nervous energy on a chance or risk becomes as
9398: necessary as the dram to the drunkard; he had only the tendency to that
9399: diffusive form of gambling which has no alcoholic intensity, but is
9400: carried on with the healthiest chyle-fed blood, keeping up a joyous
9401: imaginative activity which fashions events according to desire, and
9402: having no fears about its own weather, only sees the advantage there
9403: must be to others in going aboard with it. Hopefulness has a pleasure
9404: in making a throw of any kind, because the prospect of success is
9405: certain; and only a more generous pleasure in offering as many as
9406: possible a share in the stake. Fred liked play, especially billiards,
9407: as he liked hunting or riding a steeple-chase; and he only liked it the
9408: better because he wanted money and hoped to win. But the twenty pounds’
9409: worth of seed-corn had been planted in vain in the seductive green
9410: plot—all of it at least which had not been dispersed by the
9411: roadside—and Fred found himself close upon the term of payment with no
9412: money at command beyond the eighty pounds which he had deposited with
9413: his mother. The broken-winded horse which he rode represented a present
9414: which had been made to him a long while ago by his uncle Featherstone:
9415: his father always allowed him to keep a horse, Mr. Vincy’s own habits
9416: making him regard this as a reasonable demand even for a son who was
9417: rather exasperating. This horse, then, was Fred’s property, and in his
9418: anxiety to meet the imminent bill he determined to sacrifice a
9419: possession without which life would certainly be worth little. He made
9420: the resolution with a sense of heroism—heroism forced on him by the
9421: dread of breaking his word to Mr. Garth, by his love for Mary and awe
9422: of her opinion. He would start for Houndsley horse-fair which was to be
9423: held the next morning, and—simply sell his horse, bringing back the
9424: money by coach?—Well, the horse would hardly fetch more than thirty
9425: pounds, and there was no knowing what might happen; it would be folly
9426: to balk himself of luck beforehand. It was a hundred to one that some
9427: good chance would fall in his way; the longer he thought of it, the
9428: less possible it seemed that he should not have a good chance, and the
9429: less reasonable that he should not equip himself with the powder and
9430: shot for bringing it down. He would ride to Houndsley with Bambridge
9431: and with Horrock “the vet,” and without asking them anything expressly,
9432: he should virtually get the benefit of their opinion. Before he set
9433: out, Fred got the eighty pounds from his mother.
9434: 
9435: Most of those who saw Fred riding out of Middlemarch in company with
9436: Bambridge and Horrock, on his way of course to Houndsley horse-fair,
9437: thought that young Vincy was pleasure-seeking as usual; and but for an
9438: unwonted consciousness of grave matters on hand, he himself would have
9439: had a sense of dissipation, and of doing what might be expected of a
9440: gay young fellow. Considering that Fred was not at all coarse, that he
9441: rather looked down on the manners and speech of young men who had not
9442: been to the university, and that he had written stanzas as pastoral and
9443: unvoluptuous as his flute-playing, his attraction towards Bambridge and
9444: Horrock was an interesting fact which even the love of horse-flesh
9445: would not wholly account for without that mysterious influence of
9446: Naming which determinates so much of mortal choice. Under any other
9447: name than “pleasure” the society of Messieurs Bambridge and Horrock
9448: must certainly have been regarded as monotonous; and to arrive with
9449: them at Houndsley on a drizzling afternoon, to get down at the Red Lion
9450: in a street shaded with coal-dust, and dine in a room furnished with a
9451: dirt-enamelled map of the county, a bad portrait of an anonymous horse
9452: in a stable, His Majesty George the Fourth with legs and cravat, and
9453: various leaden spittoons, might have seemed a hard business, but for
9454: the sustaining power of nomenclature which determined that the pursuit
9455: of these things was “gay.”
9456: 
9457: In Mr. Horrock there was certainly an apparent unfathomableness which
9458: offered play to the imagination. Costume, at a glance, gave him a
9459: thrilling association with horses (enough to specify the hat-brim which
9460: took the slightest upward angle just to escape the suspicion of bending
9461: downwards), and nature had given him a face which by dint of Mongolian
9462: eyes, and a nose, mouth, and chin seeming to follow his hat-brim in a
9463: moderate inclination upwards, gave the effect of a subdued unchangeable
9464: sceptical smile, of all expressions the most tyrannous over a
9465: susceptible mind, and, when accompanied by adequate silence, likely to
9466: create the reputation of an invincible understanding, an infinite fund
9467: of humor—too dry to flow, and probably in a state of immovable
9468: crust,—and a critical judgment which, if you could ever be fortunate
9469: enough to know it, would be _the_ thing and no other. It is a
9470: physiognomy seen in all vocations, but perhaps it has never been more
9471: powerful over the youth of England than in a judge of horses.
9472: 
9473: Mr. Horrock, at a question from Fred about his horse’s fetlock, turned
9474: sideways in his saddle, and watched the horse’s action for the space of
9475: three minutes, then turned forward, twitched his own bridle, and
9476: remained silent with a profile neither more nor less sceptical than it
9477: had been.
9478: 
9479: The part thus played in dialogue by Mr. Horrock was terribly effective.
9480: A mixture of passions was excited in Fred—a mad desire to thrash
9481: Horrock’s opinion into utterance, restrained by anxiety to retain the
9482: advantage of his friendship. There was always the chance that Horrock
9483: might say something quite invaluable at the right moment.
9484: 
9485: Mr. Bambridge had more open manners, and appeared to give forth his
9486: ideas without economy. He was loud, robust, and was sometimes spoken of
9487: as being “given to indulgence”—chiefly in swearing, drinking, and
9488: beating his wife. Some people who had lost by him called him a vicious
9489: man; but he regarded horse-dealing as the finest of the arts, and might
9490: have argued plausibly that it had nothing to do with morality. He was
9491: undeniably a prosperous man, bore his drinking better than others bore
9492: their moderation, and, on the whole, flourished like the green
9493: bay-tree. But his range of conversation was limited, and like the fine
9494: old tune, “Drops of brandy,” gave you after a while a sense of
9495: returning upon itself in a way that might make weak heads dizzy. But a
9496: slight infusion of Mr. Bambridge was felt to give tone and character to
9497: several circles in Middlemarch; and he was a distinguished figure in
9498: the bar and billiard-room at the Green Dragon. He knew some anecdotes
9499: about the heroes of the turf, and various clever tricks of Marquesses
9500: and Viscounts which seemed to prove that blood asserted its
9501: pre-eminence even among black-legs; but the minute retentiveness of his
9502: memory was chiefly shown about the horses he had himself bought and
9503: sold; the number of miles they would trot you in no time without
9504: turning a hair being, after the lapse of years, still a subject of
9505: passionate asseveration, in which he would assist the imagination of
9506: his hearers by solemnly swearing that they never saw anything like it.
9507: In short, Mr. Bambridge was a man of pleasure and a gay companion.
9508: 
9509: Fred was subtle, and did not tell his friends that he was going to
9510: Houndsley bent on selling his horse: he wished to get indirectly at
9511: their genuine opinion of its value, not being aware that a genuine
9512: opinion was the last thing likely to be extracted from such eminent
9513: critics. It was not Mr. Bambridge’s weakness to be a gratuitous
9514: flatterer. He had never before been so much struck with the fact that
9515: this unfortunate bay was a roarer to a degree which required the
9516: roundest word for perdition to give you any idea of it.
9517: 
9518: “You made a bad hand at swapping when you went to anybody but me,
9519: Vincy! Why, you never threw your leg across a finer horse than that
9520: chestnut, and you gave him for this brute. If you set him cantering, he
9521: goes on like twenty sawyers. I never heard but one worse roarer in my
9522: life, and that was a roan: it belonged to Pegwell, the corn-factor; he
9523: used to drive him in his gig seven years ago, and he wanted me to take
9524: him, but I said, ‘Thank you, Peg, I don’t deal in wind-instruments.’
9525: That was what I said. It went the round of the country, that joke did.
9526: But, what the hell! the horse was a penny trumpet to that roarer of
9527: yours.”
9528: 
9529: “Why, you said just now his was worse than mine,” said Fred, more
9530: irritable than usual.
9531: 
9532: “I said a lie, then,” said Mr. Bambridge, emphatically. “There wasn’t a
9533: penny to choose between ’em.”
9534: 
9535: Fred spurred his horse, and they trotted on a little way. When they
9536: slackened again, Mr. Bambridge said—
9537: 
9538: “Not but what the roan was a better trotter than yours.”
9539: 
9540: “I’m quite satisfied with his paces, I know,” said Fred, who required
9541: all the consciousness of being in gay company to support him; “I say
9542: his trot is an uncommonly clean one, eh, Horrock?”
9543: 
9544: Mr. Horrock looked before him with as complete a neutrality as if he
9545: had been a portrait by a great master.
9546: 
9547: Fred gave up the fallacious hope of getting a genuine opinion; but on
9548: reflection he saw that Bambridge’s depreciation and Horrock’s silence
9549: were both virtually encouraging, and indicated that they thought better
9550: of the horse than they chose to say.
9551: 
9552: That very evening, indeed, before the fair had set in, Fred thought he
9553: saw a favorable opening for disposing advantageously of his horse, but
9554: an opening which made him congratulate himself on his foresight in
9555: bringing with him his eighty pounds. A young farmer, acquainted with
9556: Mr. Bambridge, came into the Red Lion, and entered into conversation
9557: about parting with a hunter, which he introduced at once as Diamond,
9558: implying that it was a public character. For himself he only wanted a
9559: useful hack, which would draw upon occasion; being about to marry and
9560: to give up hunting. The hunter was in a friend’s stable at some little
9561: distance; there was still time for gentlemen to see it before dark. The
9562: friend’s stable had to be reached through a back street where you might
9563: as easily have been poisoned without expense of drugs as in any grim
9564: street of that unsanitary period. Fred was not fortified against
9565: disgust by brandy, as his companions were, but the hope of having at
9566: last seen the horse that would enable him to make money was
9567: exhilarating enough to lead him over the same ground again the first
9568: thing in the morning. He felt sure that if he did not come to a bargain
9569: with the farmer, Bambridge would; for the stress of circumstances, Fred
9570: felt, was sharpening his acuteness and endowing him with all the
9571: constructive power of suspicion. Bambridge had run down Diamond in a
9572: way that he never would have done (the horse being a friend’s) if he
9573: had not thought of buying it; every one who looked at the animal—even
9574: Horrock—was evidently impressed with its merit. To get all the
9575: advantage of being with men of this sort, you must know how to draw
9576: your inferences, and not be a spoon who takes things literally. The
9577: color of the horse was a dappled gray, and Fred happened to know that
9578: Lord Medlicote’s man was on the look-out for just such a horse. After
9579: all his running down, Bambridge let it out in the course of the
9580: evening, when the farmer was absent, that he had seen worse horses go
9581: for eighty pounds. Of course he contradicted himself twenty times over,
9582: but when you know what is likely to be true you can test a man’s
9583: admissions. And Fred could not but reckon his own judgment of a horse
9584: as worth something. The farmer had paused over Fred’s respectable
9585: though broken-winded steed long enough to show that he thought it worth
9586: consideration, and it seemed probable that he would take it, with
9587: five-and-twenty pounds in addition, as the equivalent of Diamond. In
9588: that case Fred, when he had parted with his new horse for at least
9589: eighty pounds, would be fifty-five pounds in pocket by the transaction,
9590: and would have a hundred and thirty-five pounds towards meeting the
9591: bill; so that the deficit temporarily thrown on Mr. Garth would at the
9592: utmost be twenty-five pounds. By the time he was hurrying on his
9593: clothes in the morning, he saw so clearly the importance of not losing
9594: this rare chance, that if Bambridge and Horrock had both dissuaded him,
9595: he would not have been deluded into a direct interpretation of their
9596: purpose: he would have been aware that those deep hands held something
9597: else than a young fellow’s interest. With regard to horses, distrust
9598: was your only clew. But scepticism, as we know, can never be thoroughly
9599: applied, else life would come to a standstill: something we must
9600: believe in and do, and whatever that something may be called, it is
9601: virtually our own judgment, even when it seems like the most slavish
9602: reliance on another. Fred believed in the excellence of his bargain,
9603: and even before the fair had well set in, had got possession of the
9604: dappled gray, at the price of his old horse and thirty pounds in
9605: addition—only five pounds more than he had expected to give.
9606: 
9607: But he felt a little worried and wearied, perhaps with mental debate,
9608: and without waiting for the further gayeties of the horse-fair, he set
9609: out alone on his fourteen miles’ journey, meaning to take it very
9610: quietly and keep his horse fresh.

9618: To him who wears the strong offence’s cross.”
9619: —SHAKESPEARE: _Sonnets_.
9620: 
9621: 
9622: I am sorry to say that only the third day after the propitious events
9623: at Houndsley Fred Vincy had fallen into worse spirits than he had known
9624: in his life before. Not that he had been disappointed as to the
9625: possible market for his horse, but that before the bargain could be
9626: concluded with Lord Medlicote’s man, this Diamond, in which hope to the
9627: amount of eighty pounds had been invested, had without the slightest
9628: warning exhibited in the stable a most vicious energy in kicking, had
9629: just missed killing the groom, and had ended in laming himself severely
9630: by catching his leg in a rope that overhung the stable-board. There was
9631: no more redress for this than for the discovery of bad temper after
9632: marriage—which of course old companions were aware of before the
9633: ceremony. For some reason or other, Fred had none of his usual
9634: elasticity under this stroke of ill-fortune: he was simply aware that
9635: he had only fifty pounds, that there was no chance of his getting any
9636: more at present, and that the bill for a hundred and sixty would be
9637: presented in five days. Even if he had applied to his father on the
9638: plea that Mr. Garth should be saved from loss, Fred felt smartingly
9639: that his father would angrily refuse to rescue Mr. Garth from the
9640: consequence of what he would call encouraging extravagance and deceit.
9641: He was so utterly downcast that he could frame no other project than to
9642: go straight to Mr. Garth and tell him the sad truth, carrying with him
9643: the fifty pounds, and getting that sum at least safely out of his own
9644: hands. His father, being at the warehouse, did not yet know of the
9645: accident: when he did, he would storm about the vicious brute being
9646: brought into his stable; and before meeting that lesser annoyance Fred
9647: wanted to get away with all his courage to face the greater. He took
9648: his father’s nag, for he had made up his mind that when he had told Mr.
9649: Garth, he would ride to Stone Court and confess all to Mary. In fact,
9650: it is probable that but for Mary’s existence and Fred’s love for her,
9651: his conscience would have been much less active both in previously
9652: urging the debt on his thought and impelling him not to spare himself
9653: after his usual fashion by deferring an unpleasant task, but to act as
9654: directly and simply as he could. Even much stronger mortals than Fred
9655: Vincy hold half their rectitude in the mind of the being they love
9656: best. “The theatre of all my actions is fallen,” said an antique
9657: personage when his chief friend was dead; and they are fortunate who
9658: get a theatre where the audience demands their best. Certainly it would
9659: have made a considerable difference to Fred at that time if Mary Garth
9660: had had no decided notions as to what was admirable in character.
9661: 
9662: Mr. Garth was not at the office, and Fred rode on to his house, which
9663: was a little way outside the town—a homely place with an orchard in
9664: front of it, a rambling, old-fashioned, half-timbered building, which
9665: before the town had spread had been a farm-house, but was now
9666: surrounded with the private gardens of the townsmen. We get the fonder
9667: of our houses if they have a physiognomy of their own, as our friends
9668: have. The Garth family, which was rather a large one, for Mary had four
9669: brothers and one sister, were very fond of their old house, from which
9670: all the best furniture had long been sold. Fred liked it too, knowing
9671: it by heart even to the attic which smelt deliciously of apples and
9672: quinces, and until to-day he had never come to it without pleasant
9673: expectations; but his heart beat uneasily now with the sense that he
9674: should probably have to make his confession before Mrs. Garth, of whom
9675: he was rather more in awe than of her husband. Not that she was
9676: inclined to sarcasm and to impulsive sallies, as Mary was. In her
9677: present matronly age at least, Mrs. Garth never committed herself by
9678: over-hasty speech; having, as she said, borne the yoke in her youth,
9679: and learned self-control. She had that rare sense which discerns what
9680: is unalterable, and submits to it without murmuring. Adoring her
9681: husband’s virtues, she had very early made up her mind to his
9682: incapacity of minding his own interests, and had met the consequences
9683: cheerfully. She had been magnanimous enough to renounce all pride in
9684: teapots or children’s frilling, and had never poured any pathetic
9685: confidences into the ears of her feminine neighbors concerning Mr.
9686: Garth’s want of prudence and the sums he might have had if he had been
9687: like other men. Hence these fair neighbors thought her either proud or
9688: eccentric, and sometimes spoke of her to their husbands as “your fine
9689: Mrs. Garth.” She was not without her criticism of them in return, being
9690: more accurately instructed than most matrons in Middlemarch, and—where
9691: is the blameless woman?—apt to be a little severe towards her own sex,
9692: which in her opinion was framed to be entirely subordinate. On the
9693: other hand, she was disproportionately indulgent towards the failings
9694: of men, and was often heard to say that these were natural. Also, it
9695: must be admitted that Mrs. Garth was a trifle too emphatic in her
9696: resistance to what she held to be follies: the passage from governess
9697: into housewife had wrought itself a little too strongly into her
9698: consciousness, and she rarely forgot that while her grammar and accent
9699: were above the town standard, she wore a plain cap, cooked the family
9700: dinner, and darned all the stockings. She had sometimes taken pupils in
9701: a peripatetic fashion, making them follow her about in the kitchen with
9702: their book or slate. She thought it good for them to see that she could
9703: make an excellent lather while she corrected their blunders “without
9704: looking,”—that a woman with her sleeves tucked up above her elbows
9705: might know all about the Subjunctive Mood or the Torrid Zone—that, in
9706: short, she might possess “education” and other good things ending in
9707: “tion,” and worthy to be pronounced emphatically, without being a
9708: useless doll. When she made remarks to this edifying effect, she had a
9709: firm little frown on her brow, which yet did not hinder her face from
9710: looking benevolent, and her words which came forth like a procession
9711: were uttered in a fervid agreeable contralto. Certainly, the exemplary
9712: Mrs. Garth had her droll aspects, but her character sustained her
9713: oddities, as a very fine wine sustains a flavor of skin.
9714: 
9715: Towards Fred Vincy she had a motherly feeling, and had always been
9716: disposed to excuse his errors, though she would probably not have
9717: excused Mary for engaging herself to him, her daughter being included
9718: in that more rigorous judgment which she applied to her own sex. But
9719: this very fact of her exceptional indulgence towards him made it the
9720: harder to Fred that he must now inevitably sink in her opinion. And the
9721: circumstances of his visit turned out to be still more unpleasant than
9722: he had expected; for Caleb Garth had gone out early to look at some
9723: repairs not far off. Mrs. Garth at certain hours was always in the
9724: kitchen, and this morning she was carrying on several occupations at
9725: once there—making her pies at the well-scoured deal table on one side
9726: of that airy room, observing Sally’s movements at the oven and
9727: dough-tub through an open door, and giving lessons to her youngest boy
9728: and girl, who were standing opposite to her at the table with their
9729: books and slates before them. A tub and a clothes-horse at the other
9730: end of the kitchen indicated an intermittent wash of small things also
9731: going on.
9732: 
9733: Mrs. Garth, with her sleeves turned above her elbows, deftly handling
9734: her pastry—applying her rolling-pin and giving ornamental pinches,
9735: while she expounded with grammatical fervor what were the right views
9736: about the concord of verbs and pronouns with “nouns of multitude or
9737: signifying many,” was a sight agreeably amusing. She was of the same
9738: curly-haired, square-faced type as Mary, but handsomer, with more
9739: delicacy of feature, a pale skin, a solid matronly figure, and a
9740: remarkable firmness of glance. In her snowy-frilled cap she reminded
9741: one of that delightful Frenchwoman whom we have all seen marketing,
9742: basket on arm. Looking at the mother, you might hope that the daughter
9743: would become like her, which is a prospective advantage equal to a
9744: dowry—the mother too often standing behind the daughter like a
9745: malignant prophecy—“Such as I am, she will shortly be.”
9746: 
9747: “Now let us go through that once more,” said Mrs. Garth, pinching an
9748: apple-puff which seemed to distract Ben, an energetic young male with a
9749: heavy brow, from due attention to the lesson. “‘Not without regard to
9750: the import of the word as conveying unity or plurality of idea’—tell me
9751: again what that means, Ben.”
9752: 
9753: (Mrs. Garth, like more celebrated educators, had her favorite ancient
9754: paths, and in a general wreck of society would have tried to hold her
9755: “Lindley Murray” above the waves.)
9756: 
9757: “Oh—it means—you must think what you mean,” said Ben, rather peevishly.
9758: “I hate grammar. What’s the use of it?”
9759: 
9760: “To teach you to speak and write correctly, so that you can be
9761: understood,” said Mrs. Garth, with severe precision. “Should you like
9762: to speak as old Job does?”
9763: 
9764: “Yes,” said Ben, stoutly; “it’s funnier. He says, ‘Yo goo’—that’s just
9765: as good as ‘You go.’”
9766: 
9767: “But he says, ‘A ship’s in the garden,’ instead of ‘a sheep,’” said
9768: Letty, with an air of superiority. “You might think he meant a ship off
9769: the sea.”
9770: 
9771: “No, you mightn’t, if you weren’t silly,” said Ben. “How could a ship
9772: off the sea come there?”
9773: 
9774: “These things belong only to pronunciation, which is the least part of
9775: grammar,” said Mrs. Garth. “That apple-peel is to be eaten by the pigs,
9776: Ben; if you eat it, I must give them your piece of pasty. Job has only
9777: to speak about very plain things. How do you think you would write or
9778: speak about anything more difficult, if you knew no more of grammar
9779: than he does? You would use wrong words, and put words in the wrong
9780: places, and instead of making people understand you, they would turn
9781: away from you as a tiresome person. What would you do then?”
9782: 
9783: “I shouldn’t care, I should leave off,” said Ben, with a sense that
9784: this was an agreeable issue where grammar was concerned.
9785: 
9786: “I see you are getting tired and stupid, Ben,” said Mrs. Garth,
9787: accustomed to these obstructive arguments from her male offspring.
9788: Having finished her pies, she moved towards the clothes-horse, and
9789: said, “Come here and tell me the story I told you on Wednesday, about
9790: Cincinnatus.”
9791: 
9792: “I know! he was a farmer,” said Ben.
9793: 
9794: “Now, Ben, he was a Roman—let _me_ tell,” said Letty, using her elbow
9795: contentiously.
9796: 
9797: “You silly thing, he was a Roman farmer, and he was ploughing.”
9798: 
9799: “Yes, but before that—that didn’t come first—people wanted him,” said
9800: Letty.
9801: 
9802: “Well, but you must say what sort of a man he was first,” insisted Ben.
9803: “He was a wise man, like my father, and that made the people want his
9804: advice. And he was a brave man, and could fight. And so could my
9805: father—couldn’t he, mother?”
9806: 
9807: “Now, Ben, let me tell the story straight on, as mother told it us,”
9808: said Letty, frowning. “Please, mother, tell Ben not to speak.”
9809: 
9810: “Letty, I am ashamed of you,” said her mother, wringing out the caps
9811: from the tub. “When your brother began, you ought to have waited to see
9812: if he could not tell the story. How rude you look, pushing and
9813: frowning, as if you wanted to conquer with your elbows! Cincinnatus, I
9814: am sure, would have been sorry to see his daughter behave so.” (Mrs.
9815: Garth delivered this awful sentence with much majesty of enunciation,
9816: and Letty felt that between repressed volubility and general disesteem,
9817: that of the Romans inclusive, life was already a painful affair.) “Now,
9818: Ben.”
9819: 
9820: “Well—oh—well—why, there was a great deal of fighting, and they were
9821: all blockheads, and—I can’t tell it just how you told it—but they
9822: wanted a man to be captain and king and everything—”
9823: 
9824: “Dictator, now,” said Letty, with injured looks, and not without a wish
9825: to make her mother repent.
9826: 
9827: “Very well, dictator!” said Ben, contemptuously. “But that isn’t a good
9828: word: he didn’t tell them to write on slates.”
9829: 
9830: “Come, come, Ben, you are not so ignorant as that,” said Mrs. Garth,
9831: carefully serious. “Hark, there is a knock at the door! Run, Letty, and
9832: open it.”
9833: 
9834: The knock was Fred’s; and when Letty said that her father was not in
9835: yet, but that her mother was in the kitchen, Fred had no alternative.
9836: He could not depart from his usual practice of going to see Mrs. Garth
9837: in the kitchen if she happened to be at work there. He put his arm
9838: round Letty’s neck silently, and led her into the kitchen without his
9839: usual jokes and caresses.
9840: 
9841: Mrs. Garth was surprised to see Fred at this hour, but surprise was not
9842: a feeling that she was given to express, and she only said, quietly
9843: continuing her work—
9844: 
9845: “You, Fred, so early in the day? You look quite pale. Has anything
9846: happened?”
9847: 
9848: “I want to speak to Mr. Garth,” said Fred, not yet ready to say
9849: more—“and to you also,” he added, after a little pause, for he had no
9850: doubt that Mrs. Garth knew everything about the bill, and he must in
9851: the end speak of it before her, if not to her solely.
9852: 
9853: “Caleb will be in again in a few minutes,” said Mrs. Garth, who
9854: imagined some trouble between Fred and his father. “He is sure not to
9855: be long, because he has some work at his desk that must be done this
9856: morning. Do you mind staying with me, while I finish my matters here?”
9857: 
9858: “But we needn’t go on about Cincinnatus, need we?” said Ben, who had
9859: taken Fred’s whip out of his hand, and was trying its efficiency on the
9860: cat.
9861: 
9862: “No, go out now. But put that whip down. How very mean of you to whip
9863: poor old Tortoise! Pray take the whip from him, Fred.”
9864: 
9865: “Come, old boy, give it me,” said Fred, putting out his hand.
9866: 
9867: “Will you let me ride on your horse to-day?” said Ben, rendering up the
9868: whip, with an air of not being obliged to do it.
9869: 
9870: “Not to-day—another time. I am not riding my own horse.”
9871: 
9872: “Shall you see Mary to-day?”
9873: 
9874: “Yes, I think so,” said Fred, with an unpleasant twinge.
9875: 
9876: “Tell her to come home soon, and play at forfeits, and make fun.”
9877: 
9878: “Enough, enough, Ben! run away,” said Mrs. Garth, seeing that Fred was
9879: teased.
9880: 
9881: “Are Letty and Ben your only pupils now, Mrs. Garth?” said Fred, when
9882: the children were gone and it was needful to say something that would
9883: pass the time. He was not yet sure whether he should wait for Mr.
9884: Garth, or use any good opportunity in conversation to confess to Mrs.
9885: Garth herself, give her the money and ride away.
9886: 
9887: “One—only one. Fanny Hackbutt comes at half past eleven. I am not
9888: getting a great income now,” said Mrs. Garth, smiling. “I am at a low
9889: ebb with pupils. But I have saved my little purse for Alfred’s premium:
9890: I have ninety-two pounds. He can go to Mr. Hanmer’s now; he is just at
9891: the right age.”
9892: 
9893: This did not lead well towards the news that Mr. Garth was on the brink
9894: of losing ninety-two pounds and more. Fred was silent. “Young gentlemen
9895: who go to college are rather more costly than that,” Mrs. Garth
9896: innocently continued, pulling out the edging on a cap-border. “And
9897: Caleb thinks that Alfred will turn out a distinguished engineer: he
9898: wants to give the boy a good chance. There he is! I hear him coming in.
9899: We will go to him in the parlor, shall we?”
9900: 
9901: When they entered the parlor Caleb had thrown down his hat and was
9902: seated at his desk.
9903: 
9904: “What! Fred, my boy!” he said, in a tone of mild surprise, holding his
9905: pen still undipped; “you are here betimes.” But missing the usual
9906: expression of cheerful greeting in Fred’s face, he immediately added,
9907: “Is there anything up at home?—anything the matter?”
9908: 
9909: “Yes, Mr. Garth, I am come to tell something that I am afraid will give
9910: you a bad opinion of me. I am come to tell you and Mrs. Garth that I
9911: can’t keep my word. I can’t find the money to meet the bill after all.
9912: I have been unfortunate; I have only got these fifty pounds towards the
9913: hundred and sixty.”
9914: 
9915: While Fred was speaking, he had taken out the notes and laid them on
9916: the desk before Mr. Garth. He had burst forth at once with the plain
9917: fact, feeling boyishly miserable and without verbal resources. Mrs.
9918: Garth was mutely astonished, and looked at her husband for an
9919: explanation. Caleb blushed, and after a little pause said—
9920: 
9921: “Oh, I didn’t tell you, Susan: I put my name to a bill for Fred; it was
9922: for a hundred and sixty pounds. He made sure he could meet it himself.”
9923: 
9924: There was an evident change in Mrs. Garth’s face, but it was like a
9925: change below the surface of water which remains smooth. She fixed her
9926: eyes on Fred, saying—
9927: 
9928: “I suppose you have asked your father for the rest of the money and he
9929: has refused you.”
9930: 
9931: “No,” said Fred, biting his lip, and speaking with more difficulty;
9932: “but I know it will be of no use to ask him; and unless it were of use,
9933: I should not like to mention Mr. Garth’s name in the matter.”
9934: 
9935: “It has come at an unfortunate time,” said Caleb, in his hesitating
9936: way, looking down at the notes and nervously fingering the paper,
9937: “Christmas upon us—I’m rather hard up just now. You see, I have to cut
9938: out everything like a tailor with short measure. What can we do, Susan?
9939: I shall want every farthing we have in the bank. It’s a hundred and ten
9940: pounds, the deuce take it!”
9941: 
9942: “I must give you the ninety-two pounds that I have put by for Alfred’s
9943: premium,” said Mrs. Garth, gravely and decisively, though a nice ear
9944: might have discerned a slight tremor in some of the words. “And I have
9945: no doubt that Mary has twenty pounds saved from her salary by this
9946: time. She will advance it.”
9947: 
9948: Mrs. Garth had not again looked at Fred, and was not in the least
9949: calculating what words she should use to cut him the most effectively.
9950: Like the eccentric woman she was, she was at present absorbed in
9951: considering what was to be done, and did not fancy that the end could
9952: be better achieved by bitter remarks or explosions. But she had made
9953: Fred feel for the first time something like the tooth of remorse.
9954: Curiously enough, his pain in the affair beforehand had consisted
9955: almost entirely in the sense that he must seem dishonorable, and sink
9956: in the opinion of the Garths: he had not occupied himself with the
9957: inconvenience and possible injury that his breach might occasion them,
9958: for this exercise of the imagination on other people’s needs is not
9959: common with hopeful young gentlemen. Indeed we are most of us brought
9960: up in the notion that the highest motive for not doing a wrong is
9961: something irrespective of the beings who would suffer the wrong. But at
9962: this moment he suddenly saw himself as a pitiful rascal who was robbing
9963: two women of their savings.
9964: 
9965: “I shall certainly pay it all, Mrs. Garth—ultimately,” he stammered
9966: out.
9967: 
9968: “Yes, ultimately,” said Mrs. Garth, who having a special dislike to
9969: fine words on ugly occasions, could not now repress an epigram. “But
9970: boys cannot well be apprenticed ultimately: they should be apprenticed
9971: at fifteen.” She had never been so little inclined to make excuses for
9972: Fred.
9973: 
9974: “I was the most in the wrong, Susan,” said Caleb. “Fred made sure of
9975: finding the money. But I’d no business to be fingering bills. I suppose
9976: you have looked all round and tried all honest means?” he added, fixing
9977: his merciful gray eyes on Fred. Caleb was too delicate to specify Mr.
9978: Featherstone.
9979: 
9980: “Yes, I have tried everything—I really have. I should have had a
9981: hundred and thirty pounds ready but for a misfortune with a horse which
9982: I was about to sell. My uncle had given me eighty pounds, and I paid
9983: away thirty with my old horse in order to get another which I was going
9984: to sell for eighty or more—I meant to go without a horse—but now it has
9985: turned out vicious and lamed itself. I wish I and the horses too had
9986: been at the devil, before I had brought this on you. There’s no one
9987: else I care so much for: you and Mrs. Garth have always been so kind to
9988: me. However, it’s no use saying that. You will always think me a rascal
9989: now.”
9990: 
9991: Fred turned round and hurried out of the room, conscious that he was
9992: getting rather womanish, and feeling confusedly that his being sorry
9993: was not of much use to the Garths. They could see him mount, and
9994: quickly pass through the gate.
9995: 
9996: “I am disappointed in Fred Vincy,” said Mrs. Garth. “I would not have
9997: believed beforehand that he would have drawn you into his debts. I knew
9998: he was extravagant, but I did not think that he would be so mean as to
9999: hang his risks on his oldest friend, who could the least afford to
10000: lose.”
10001: 
10002: “I was a fool, Susan.”
10003: 
10004: “That you were,” said the wife, nodding and smiling. “But I should not
10005: have gone to publish it in the market-place. Why should you keep such
10006: things from me? It is just so with your buttons: you let them burst off
10007: without telling me, and go out with your wristband hanging. If I had
10008: only known I might have been ready with some better plan.”
10009: 
10010: “You are sadly cut up, I know, Susan,” said Caleb, looking feelingly at
10011: her. “I can’t abide your losing the money you’ve scraped together for
10012: Alfred.”
10013: 
10014: “It is very well that I _had_ scraped it together; and it is you who
10015: will have to suffer, for you must teach the boy yourself. You must give
10016: up your bad habits. Some men take to drinking, and you have taken to
10017: working without pay. You must indulge yourself a little less in that.
10018: And you must ride over to Mary, and ask the child what money she has.”
10019: 
10020: Caleb had pushed his chair back, and was leaning forward, shaking his
10021: head slowly, and fitting his finger-tips together with much nicety.
10022: 
10023: “Poor Mary!” he said. “Susan,” he went on in a lowered tone, “I’m
10024: afraid she may be fond of Fred.”
10025: 
10026: “Oh no! She always laughs at him; and he is not likely to think of her
10027: in any other than a brotherly way.”
10028: 
10029: Caleb made no rejoinder, but presently lowered his spectacles, drew up
10030: his chair to the desk, and said, “Deuce take the bill—I wish it was at
10031: Hanover! These things are a sad interruption to business!”
10032: 
10033: The first part of this speech comprised his whole store of maledictory
10034: expression, and was uttered with a slight snarl easy to imagine. But it
10035: would be difficult to convey to those who never heard him utter the
10036: word “business,” the peculiar tone of fervid veneration, of religious
10037: regard, in which he wrapped it, as a consecrated symbol is wrapped in
10038: its gold-fringed linen.
10039: 
10040: Caleb Garth often shook his head in meditation on the value, the
10041: indispensable might of that myriad-headed, myriad-handed labor by which
10042: the social body is fed, clothed, and housed. It had laid hold of his
10043: imagination in boyhood. The echoes of the great hammer where roof or
10044: keel were a-making, the signal-shouts of the workmen, the roar of the
10045: furnace, the thunder and plash of the engine, were a sublime music to
10046: him; the felling and lading of timber, and the huge trunk vibrating
10047: star-like in the distance along the highway, the crane at work on the
10048: wharf, the piled-up produce in warehouses, the precision and variety of
10049: muscular effort wherever exact work had to be turned out,—all these
10050: sights of his youth had acted on him as poetry without the aid of the
10051: poets, had made a philosophy for him without the aid of philosophers, a
10052: religion without the aid of theology. His early ambition had been to
10053: have as effective a share as possible in this sublime labor, which was
10054: peculiarly dignified by him with the name of “business;” and though he
10055: had only been a short time under a surveyor, and had been chiefly his
10056: own teacher, he knew more of land, building, and mining than most of
10057: the special men in the county.
10058: 
10059: His classification of human employments was rather crude, and, like the
10060: categories of more celebrated men, would not be acceptable in these
10061: advanced times. He divided them into “business, politics, preaching,
10062: learning, and amusement.” He had nothing to say against the last four;
10063: but he regarded them as a reverential pagan regarded other gods than
10064: his own. In the same way, he thought very well of all ranks, but he
10065: would not himself have liked to be of any rank in which he had not such
10066: close contact with “business” as to get often honorably decorated with
10067: marks of dust and mortar, the damp of the engine, or the sweet soil of
10068: the woods and fields. Though he had never regarded himself as other
10069: than an orthodox Christian, and would argue on prevenient grace if the
10070: subject were proposed to him, I think his virtual divinities were good
10071: practical schemes, accurate work, and the faithful completion of
10072: undertakings: his prince of darkness was a slack workman. But there was
10073: no spirit of denial in Caleb, and the world seemed so wondrous to him
10074: that he was ready to accept any number of systems, like any number of
10075: firmaments, if they did not obviously interfere with the best
10076: land-drainage, solid building, correct measuring, and judicious boring
10077: (for coal). In fact, he had a reverential soul with a strong practical
10078: intelligence. But he could not manage finance: he knew values well, but
10079: he had no keenness of imagination for monetary results in the shape of
10080: profit and loss: and having ascertained this to his cost, he determined
10081: to give up all forms of his beloved “business” which required that
10082: talent. He gave himself up entirely to the many kinds of work which he
10083: could do without handling capital, and was one of those precious men
10084: within his own district whom everybody would choose to work for them,
10085: because he did his work well, charged very little, and often declined
10086: to charge at all. It is no wonder, then, that the Garths were poor, and
10087: “lived in a small way.” However, they did not mind it.

10093: 
10094: “Love seeketh not itself to please,
10095:     Nor for itself hath any care
10096: But for another gives its ease
10097:     And builds a heaven in hell’s despair.
10098: . . . . . . .
10099: Love seeketh only self to please,
10100:     To bind another to its delight,

10104: 
10105: 
10106: Fred Vincy wanted to arrive at Stone Court when Mary could not expect
10107: him, and when his uncle was not downstairs: in that case she might be
10108: sitting alone in the wainscoted parlor. He left his horse in the yard
10109: to avoid making a noise on the gravel in front, and entered the parlor
10110: without other notice than the noise of the door-handle. Mary was in her
10111: usual corner, laughing over Mrs. Piozzi’s recollections of Johnson, and
10112: looked up with the fun still in her face. It gradually faded as she saw
10113: Fred approach her without speaking, and stand before her with his elbow
10114: on the mantel-piece, looking ill. She too was silent, only raising her
10115: eyes to him inquiringly.
10116: 
10117: “Mary,” he began, “I am a good-for-nothing blackguard.”
10118: 
10119: “I should think one of those epithets would do at a time,” said Mary,
10120: trying to smile, but feeling alarmed.
10121: 
10122: “I know you will never think well of me any more. You will think me a
10123: liar. You will think me dishonest. You will think I didn’t care for
10124: you, or your father and mother. You always do make the worst of me, I
10125: know.”
10126: 
10127: “I cannot deny that I shall think all that of you, Fred, if you give me
10128: good reasons. But please to tell me at once what you have done. I would
10129: rather know the painful truth than imagine it.”
10130: 
10131: “I owed money—a hundred and sixty pounds. I asked your father to put
10132: his name to a bill. I thought it would not signify to him. I made sure
10133: of paying the money myself, and I have tried as hard as I could. And
10134: now, I have been so unlucky—a horse has turned out badly—I can only pay
10135: fifty pounds. And I can’t ask my father for the money: he would not
10136: give me a farthing. And my uncle gave me a hundred a little while ago.
10137: So what can I do? And now your father has no ready money to spare, and
10138: your mother will have to pay away her ninety-two pounds that she has
10139: saved, and she says your savings must go too. You see what a—”
10140: 
10141: “Oh, poor mother, poor father!” said Mary, her eyes filling with tears,
10142: and a little sob rising which she tried to repress. She looked straight
10143: before her and took no notice of Fred, all the consequences at home
10144: becoming present to her. He too remained silent for some moments,
10145: feeling more miserable than ever. “I wouldn’t have hurt you for the
10146: world, Mary,” he said at last. “You can never forgive me.”
10147: 
10148: “What does it matter whether I forgive you?” said Mary, passionately.
10149: “Would that make it any better for my mother to lose the money she has
10150: been earning by lessons for four years, that she might send Alfred to
10151: Mr. Hanmer’s? Should you think all that pleasant enough if I forgave
10152: you?”
10153: 
10154: “Say what you like, Mary. I deserve it all.”
10155: 
10156: “I don’t want to say anything,” said Mary, more quietly, “and my anger
10157: is of no use.” She dried her eyes, threw aside her book, rose and
10158: fetched her sewing.
10159: 
10160: Fred followed her with his eyes, hoping that they would meet hers, and
10161: in that way find access for his imploring penitence. But no! Mary could
10162: easily avoid looking upward.
10163: 
10164: “I do care about your mother’s money going,” he said, when she was
10165: seated again and sewing quickly. “I wanted to ask you, Mary—don’t you
10166: think that Mr. Featherstone—if you were to tell him—tell him, I mean,
10167: about apprenticing Alfred—would advance the money?”
10168: 
10169: “My family is not fond of begging, Fred. We would rather work for our
10170: money. Besides, you say that Mr. Featherstone has lately given you a
10171: hundred pounds. He rarely makes presents; he has never made presents to
10172: us. I am sure my father will not ask him for anything; and even if I
10173: chose to beg of him, it would be of no use.”
10174: 
10175: “I am so miserable, Mary—if you knew how miserable I am, you would be
10176: sorry for me.”
10177: 
10178: “There are other things to be more sorry for than that. But selfish
10179: people always think their own discomfort of more importance than
10180: anything else in the world. I see enough of that every day.”
10181: 
10182: “It is hardly fair to call me selfish. If you knew what things other
10183: young men do, you would think me a good way off the worst.”
10184: 
10185: “I know that people who spend a great deal of money on themselves
10186: without knowing how they shall pay, must be selfish. They are always
10187: thinking of what they can get for themselves, and not of what other
10188: people may lose.”
10189: 
10190: “Any man may be unfortunate, Mary, and find himself unable to pay when
10191: he meant it. There is not a better man in the world than your father,
10192: and yet he got into trouble.”
10193: 
10194: “How dare you make any comparison between my father and you, Fred?”
10195: said Mary, in a deep tone of indignation. “He never got into trouble by
10196: thinking of his own idle pleasures, but because he was always thinking
10197: of the work he was doing for other people. And he has fared hard, and
10198: worked hard to make good everybody’s loss.”
10199: 
10200: “And you think that I shall never try to make good anything, Mary. It
10201: is not generous to believe the worst of a man. When you have got any
10202: power over him, I think you might try and use it to make him better;
10203: but that is what you never do. However, I’m going,” Fred ended,
10204: languidly. “I shall never speak to you about anything again. I’m very
10205: sorry for all the trouble I’ve caused—that’s all.”
10206: 
10207: Mary had dropped her work out of her hand and looked up. There is often
10208: something maternal even in a girlish love, and Mary’s hard experience
10209: had wrought her nature to an impressibility very different from that
10210: hard slight thing which we call girlishness. At Fred’s last words she
10211: felt an instantaneous pang, something like what a mother feels at the
10212: imagined sobs or cries of her naughty truant child, which may lose
10213: itself and get harm. And when, looking up, her eyes met his dull
10214: despairing glance, her pity for him surmounted her anger and all her
10215: other anxieties.
10216: 
10217: “Oh, Fred, how ill you look! Sit down a moment. Don’t go yet. Let me
10218: tell uncle that you are here. He has been wondering that he has not
10219: seen you for a whole week.” Mary spoke hurriedly, saying the words that
10220: came first without knowing very well what they were, but saying them in
10221: a half-soothing half-beseeching tone, and rising as if to go away to
10222: Mr. Featherstone. Of course Fred felt as if the clouds had parted and a
10223: gleam had come: he moved and stood in her way.
10224: 
10225: “Say one word, Mary, and I will do anything. Say you will not think the
10226: worst of me—will not give me up altogether.”
10227: 
10228: “As if it were any pleasure to me to think ill of you,” said Mary, in a
10229: mournful tone. “As if it were not very painful to me to see you an idle
10230: frivolous creature. How can you bear to be so contemptible, when others
10231: are working and striving, and there are so many things to be done—how
10232: can you bear to be fit for nothing in the world that is useful? And
10233: with so much good in your disposition, Fred,—you might be worth a great
10234: deal.”
10235: 
10236: “I will try to be anything you like, Mary, if you will say that you
10237: love me.”
10238: 
10239: “I should be ashamed to say that I loved a man who must always be
10240: hanging on others, and reckoning on what they would do for him. What
10241: will you be when you are forty? Like Mr. Bowyer, I suppose—just as
10242: idle, living in Mrs. Beck’s front parlor—fat and shabby, hoping
10243: somebody will invite you to dinner—spending your morning in learning a
10244: comic song—oh no! learning a tune on the flute.”
10245: 
10246: Mary’s lips had begun to curl with a smile as soon as she had asked
10247: that question about Fred’s future (young souls are mobile), and before
10248: she ended, her face had its full illumination of fun. To him it was
10249: like the cessation of an ache that Mary could laugh at him, and with a
10250: passive sort of smile he tried to reach her hand; but she slipped away
10251: quickly towards the door and said, “I shall tell uncle. You _must_ see
10252: him for a moment or two.”
10253: 
10254: Fred secretly felt that his future was guaranteed against the
10255: fulfilment of Mary’s sarcastic prophecies, apart from that “anything”
10256: which he was ready to do if she would define it. He never dared in
10257: Mary’s presence to approach the subject of his expectations from Mr.
10258: Featherstone, and she always ignored them, as if everything depended on
10259: himself. But if ever he actually came into the property, she must
10260: recognize the change in his position. All this passed through his mind
10261: somewhat languidly, before he went up to see his uncle. He stayed but a
10262: little while, excusing himself on the ground that he had a cold; and
10263: Mary did not reappear before he left the house. But as he rode home, he
10264: began to be more conscious of being ill, than of being melancholy.
10265: 
10266: When Caleb Garth arrived at Stone Court soon after dusk, Mary was not
10267: surprised, although he seldom had leisure for paying her a visit, and
10268: was not at all fond of having to talk with Mr. Featherstone. The old
10269: man, on the other hand, felt himself ill at ease with a brother-in-law
10270: whom he could not annoy, who did not mind about being considered poor,
10271: had nothing to ask of him, and understood all kinds of farming and
10272: mining business better than he did. But Mary had felt sure that her
10273: parents would want to see her, and if her father had not come, she
10274: would have obtained leave to go home for an hour or two the next day.
10275: After discussing prices during tea with Mr. Featherstone, Caleb rose to
10276: bid him good-by, and said, “I want to speak to you, Mary.”
10277: 
10278: She took a candle into another large parlor, where there was no fire,
10279: and setting down the feeble light on the dark mahogany table, turned
10280: round to her father, and putting her arms round his neck kissed him
10281: with childish kisses which he delighted in,—the expression of his large
10282: brows softening as the expression of a great beautiful dog softens when
10283: it is caressed. Mary was his favorite child, and whatever Susan might
10284: say, and right as she was on all other subjects, Caleb thought it
10285: natural that Fred or any one else should think Mary more lovable than
10286: other girls.
10287: 
10288: “I’ve got something to tell you, my dear,” said Caleb in his hesitating
10289: way. “No very good news; but then it might be worse.”
10290: 
10291: “About money, father? I think I know what it is.”
10292: 
10293: “Ay? how can that be? You see, I’ve been a bit of a fool again, and put
10294: my name to a bill, and now it comes to paying; and your mother has got
10295: to part with her savings, that’s the worst of it, and even they won’t
10296: quite make things even. We wanted a hundred and ten pounds: your mother
10297: has ninety-two, and I have none to spare in the bank; and she thinks
10298: that you have some savings.”
10299: 
10300: “Oh yes; I have more than four-and-twenty pounds. I thought you would
10301: come, father, so I put it in my bag. See! beautiful white notes and
10302: gold.”
10303: 
10304: Mary took out the folded money from her reticule and put it into her
10305: father’s hand.
10306: 
10307: “Well, but how—we only want eighteen—here, put the rest back,
10308: child,—but how did you know about it?” said Caleb, who, in his
10309: unconquerable indifference to money, was beginning to be chiefly
10310: concerned about the relation the affair might have to Mary’s
10311: affections.
10312: 
10313: “Fred told me this morning.”
10314: 
10315: “Ah! Did he come on purpose?”
10316: 
10317: “Yes, I think so. He was a good deal distressed.”
10318: 
10319: “I’m afraid Fred is not to be trusted, Mary,” said the father, with
10320: hesitating tenderness. “He means better than he acts, perhaps. But I
10321: should think it a pity for any body’s happiness to be wrapped up in
10322: him, and so would your mother.”
10323: 
10324: “And so should I, father,” said Mary, not looking up, but putting the
10325: back of her father’s hand against her cheek.
10326: 
10327: “I don’t want to pry, my dear. But I was afraid there might be
10328: something between you and Fred, and I wanted to caution you. You see,
10329: Mary”—here Caleb’s voice became more tender; he had been pushing his
10330: hat about on the table and looking at it, but finally he turned his
10331: eyes on his daughter—“a woman, let her be as good as she may, has got
10332: to put up with the life her husband makes for her. Your mother has had
10333: to put up with a good deal because of me.”
10334: 
10335: Mary turned the back of her father’s hand to her lips and smiled at
10336: him.
10337: 
10338: “Well, well, nobody’s perfect, but”—here Mr. Garth shook his head to
10339: help out the inadequacy of words—“what I am thinking of is—what it must
10340: be for a wife when she’s never sure of her husband, when he hasn’t got
10341: a principle in him to make him more afraid of doing the wrong thing by
10342: others than of getting his own toes pinched. That’s the long and the
10343: short of it, Mary. Young folks may get fond of each other before they
10344: know what life is, and they may think it all holiday if they can only
10345: get together; but it soon turns into working day, my dear. However, you
10346: have more sense than most, and you haven’t been kept in cotton-wool:
10347: there may be no occasion for me to say this, but a father trembles for
10348: his daughter, and you are all by yourself here.”
10349: 
10350: “Don’t fear for me, father,” said Mary, gravely meeting her father’s
10351: eyes; “Fred has always been very good to me; he is kind-hearted and
10352: affectionate, and not false, I think, with all his self-indulgence. But
10353: I will never engage myself to one who has no manly independence, and
10354: who goes on loitering away his time on the chance that others will
10355: provide for him. You and my mother have taught me too much pride for
10356: that.”
10357: 
10358: “That’s right—that’s right. Then I am easy,” said Mr. Garth, taking up
10359: his hat. “But it’s hard to run away with your earnings, eh child.”
10360: 
10361: “Father!” said Mary, in her deepest tone of remonstrance. “Take
10362: pocketfuls of love besides to them all at home,” was her last word
10363: before he closed the outer door on himself.
10364: 
10365: “I suppose your father wanted your earnings,” said old Mr.
10366: Featherstone, with his usual power of unpleasant surmise, when Mary
10367: returned to him. “He makes but a tight fit, I reckon. You’re of age
10368: now; you ought to be saving for yourself.”
10369: 
10370: “I consider my father and mother the best part of myself, sir,” said
10371: Mary, coldly.
10372: 
10373: Mr. Featherstone grunted: he could not deny that an ordinary sort of
10374: girl like her might be expected to be useful, so he thought of another
10375: rejoinder, disagreeable enough to be always apropos. “If Fred Vincy
10376: comes to-morrow, now, don’t you keep him chattering: let him come up to
10377: me.”
10378: 
10379: 
10380: 
10381: 
10382: CHAPTER XXVI.
10383: 
10384: He beats me and I rail at him: O worthy satisfaction! would it were
10385: otherwise—that I could beat him while he railed at me.—_Troilus and
10386: Cressida_.
10387: 
10388: 
10389: But Fred did not go to Stone Court the next day, for reasons that were
10390: quite peremptory. From those visits to unsanitary Houndsley streets in
10391: search of Diamond, he had brought back not only a bad bargain in
10392: horse-flesh, but the further misfortune of some ailment which for a day
10393: or two had deemed mere depression and headache, but which got so much
10394: worse when he returned from his visit to Stone Court that, going into
10395: the dining-room, he threw himself on the sofa, and in answer to his
10396: mother’s anxious question, said, “I feel very ill: I think you must
10397: send for Wrench.”
10398: 
10399: Wrench came, but did not apprehend anything serious, spoke of a “slight
10400: derangement,” and did not speak of coming again on the morrow. He had a
10401: due value for the Vincys’ house, but the wariest men are apt to be
10402: dulled by routine, and on worried mornings will sometimes go through
10403: their business with the zest of the daily bell-ringer. Mr. Wrench was a
10404: small, neat, bilious man, with a well-dressed wig: he had a laborious
10405: practice, an irascible temper, a lymphatic wife and seven children; and
10406: he was already rather late before setting out on a four-miles drive to
10407: meet Dr. Minchin on the other side of Tipton, the decease of Hicks, a
10408: rural practitioner, having increased Middlemarch practice in that
10409: direction. Great statesmen err, and why not small medical men? Mr.
10410: Wrench did not neglect sending the usual white parcels, which this time
10411: had black and drastic contents. Their effect was not alleviating to
10412: poor Fred, who, however, unwilling as he said to believe that he was
10413: “in for an illness,” rose at his usual easy hour the next morning and
10414: went down-stairs meaning to breakfast, but succeeded in nothing but in
10415: sitting and shivering by the fire. Mr. Wrench was again sent for, but
10416: was gone on his rounds, and Mrs. Vincy seeing her darling’s changed
10417: looks and general misery, began to cry and said she would send for Dr.
10418: Sprague.
10419: 
10420: “Oh, nonsense, mother! It’s nothing,” said Fred, putting out his hot
10421: dry hand to her, “I shall soon be all right. I must have taken cold in
10422: that nasty damp ride.”
10423: 
10424: “Mamma!” said Rosamond, who was seated near the window (the dining-room
10425: windows looked on that highly respectable street called Lowick Gate),
10426: “there is Mr. Lydgate, stopping to speak to some one. If I were you I
10427: would call him in. He has cured Ellen Bulstrode. They say he cures
10428: every one.”
10429: 
10430: Mrs. Vincy sprang to the window and opened it in an instant, thinking
10431: only of Fred and not of medical etiquette. Lydgate was only two yards
10432: off on the other side of some iron palisading, and turned round at the
10433: sudden sound of the sash, before she called to him. In two minutes he
10434: was in the room, and Rosamond went out, after waiting just long enough
10435: to show a pretty anxiety conflicting with her sense of what was
10436: becoming.
10437: 
10438: Lydgate had to hear a narrative in which Mrs. Vincy’s mind insisted
10439: with remarkable instinct on every point of minor importance, especially
10440: on what Mr. Wrench had said and had not said about coming again. That
10441: there might be an awkward affair with Wrench, Lydgate saw at once; but
10442: the case was serious enough to make him dismiss that consideration: he
10443: was convinced that Fred was in the pink-skinned stage of typhoid fever,
10444: and that he had taken just the wrong medicines. He must go to bed
10445: immediately, must have a regular nurse, and various appliances and
10446: precautions must be used, about which Lydgate was particular. Poor Mrs.
10447: Vincy’s terror at these indications of danger found vent in such words
10448: as came most easily. She thought it “very ill usage on the part of Mr.
10449: Wrench, who had attended their house so many years in preference to Mr.
10450: Peacock, though Mr. Peacock was equally a friend. Why Mr. Wrench should
10451: neglect her children more than others, she could not for the life of
10452: her understand. He had not neglected Mrs. Larcher’s when they had the
10453: measles, nor indeed would Mrs. Vincy have wished that he should. And if
10454: anything should happen—”
10455: 
10456: Here poor Mrs. Vincy’s spirit quite broke down, and her Niobe throat
10457: and good-humored face were sadly convulsed. This was in the hall out of
10458: Fred’s hearing, but Rosamond had opened the drawing-room door, and now
10459: came forward anxiously. Lydgate apologized for Mr. Wrench, said that
10460: the symptoms yesterday might have been disguising, and that this form
10461: of fever was very equivocal in its beginnings: he would go immediately
10462: to the druggist’s and have a prescription made up in order to lose no
10463: time, but he would write to Mr. Wrench and tell him what had been done.
10464: 
10465: “But you must come again—you must go on attending Fred. I can’t have my
10466: boy left to anybody who may come or not. I bear nobody ill-will, thank
10467: God, and Mr. Wrench saved me in the pleurisy, but he’d better have let
10468: me die—if—if—”
10469: 
10470: “I will meet Mr. Wrench here, then, shall I?” said Lydgate, really
10471: believing that Wrench was not well prepared to deal wisely with a case
10472: of this kind.
10473: 
10474: “Pray make that arrangement, Mr. Lydgate,” said Rosamond, coming to her
10475: mother’s aid, and supporting her arm to lead her away.
10476: 
10477: When Mr. Vincy came home he was very angry with Wrench, and did not
10478: care if he never came into his house again. Lydgate should go on now,
10479: whether Wrench liked it or not. It was no joke to have fever in the
10480: house. Everybody must be sent to now, not to come to dinner on
10481: Thursday. And Pritchard needn’t get up any wine: brandy was the best
10482: thing against infection. “I shall drink brandy,” added Mr. Vincy,
10483: emphatically—as much as to say, this was not an occasion for firing
10484: with blank-cartridges. “He’s an uncommonly unfortunate lad, is Fred.
10485: He’d need have some luck by and by to make up for all this—else I don’t
10486: know who’d have an eldest son.”
10487: 
10488: “Don’t say so, Vincy,” said the mother, with a quivering lip, “if you
10489: don’t want him to be taken from me.”
10490: 
10491: “It will worret you to death, Lucy; _that_ I can see,” said Mr. Vincy,
10492: more mildly. “However, Wrench shall know what I think of the matter.”
10493: (What Mr. Vincy thought confusedly was, that the fever might somehow
10494: have been hindered if Wrench had shown the proper solicitude about
10495: his—the Mayor’s—family.) “I’m the last man to give in to the cry about
10496: new doctors, or new parsons either—whether they’re Bulstrode’s men or
10497: not. But Wrench shall know what I think, take it as he will.”
10498: 
10499: Wrench did not take it at all well. Lydgate was as polite as he could
10500: be in his offhand way, but politeness in a man who has placed you at a
10501: disadvantage is only an additional exasperation, especially if he
10502: happens to have been an object of dislike beforehand. Country
10503: practitioners used to be an irritable species, susceptible on the point
10504: of honor; and Mr. Wrench was one of the most irritable among them. He
10505: did not refuse to meet Lydgate in the evening, but his temper was
10506: somewhat tried on the occasion. He had to hear Mrs. Vincy say—
10507: 
10508: “Oh, Mr. Wrench, what have I ever done that you should use me so?— To
10509: go away, and never to come again! And my boy might have been stretched
10510: a corpse!”
10511: 
10512: Mr. Vincy, who had been keeping up a sharp fire on the enemy Infection,
10513: and was a good deal heated in consequence, started up when he heard
10514: Wrench come in, and went into the hall to let him know what he thought.
10515: 
10516: “I’ll tell you what, Wrench, this is beyond a joke,” said the Mayor,
10517: who of late had had to rebuke offenders with an official air, and now
10518: broadened himself by putting his thumbs in his armholes. “To let fever
10519: get unawares into a house like this. There are some things that ought
10520: to be actionable, and are not so— that’s my opinion.”
10521: 
10522: But irrational reproaches were easier to bear than the sense of being
10523: instructed, or rather the sense that a younger man, like Lydgate,
10524: inwardly considered him in need of instruction, for “in point of fact,”
10525: Mr. Wrench afterwards said, Lydgate paraded flighty, foreign notions,
10526: which would not wear. He swallowed his ire for the moment, but he
10527: afterwards wrote to decline further attendance in the case. The house
10528: might be a good one, but Mr. Wrench was not going to truckle to anybody
10529: on a professional matter. He reflected, with much probability on his
10530: side, that Lydgate would by-and-by be caught tripping too, and that his
10531: ungentlemanly attempts to discredit the sale of drugs by his
10532: professional brethren, would by-and-by recoil on himself. He threw out
10533: biting remarks on Lydgate’s tricks, worthy only of a quack, to get
10534: himself a factitious reputation with credulous people. That cant about
10535: cures was never got up by sound practitioners.
10536: 
10537: This was a point on which Lydgate smarted as much as Wrench could
10538: desire. To be puffed by ignorance was not only humiliating, but
10539: perilous, and not more enviable than the reputation of the
10540: weather-prophet. He was impatient of the foolish expectations amidst
10541: which all work must be carried on, and likely enough to damage himself
10542: as much as Mr. Wrench could wish, by an unprofessional openness.
10543: 
10544: However, Lydgate was installed as medical attendant on the Vincys, and
10545: the event was a subject of general conversation in Middlemarch. Some
10546: said, that the Vincys had behaved scandalously, that Mr. Vincy had
10547: threatened Wrench, and that Mrs. Vincy had accused him of poisoning her
10548: son. Others were of opinion that Mr. Lydgate’s passing by was
10549: providential, that he was wonderfully clever in fevers, and that
10550: Bulstrode was in the right to bring him forward. Many people believed
10551: that Lydgate’s coming to the town at all was really due to Bulstrode;
10552: and Mrs. Taft, who was always counting stitches and gathered her
10553: information in misleading fragments caught between the rows of her
10554: knitting, had got it into her head that Mr. Lydgate was a natural son
10555: of Bulstrode’s, a fact which seemed to justify her suspicions of
10556: evangelical laymen.
10557: 
10558: She one day communicated this piece of knowledge to Mrs. Farebrother,
10559: who did not fail to tell her son of it, observing—
10560: 
10561: “I should not be surprised at anything in Bulstrode, but I should be
10562: sorry to think it of Mr. Lydgate.”
10563: 
10564: “Why, mother,” said Mr. Farebrother, after an explosive laugh, “you
10565: know very well that Lydgate is of a good family in the North. He never
10566: heard of Bulstrode before he came here.”
10567: 
10568: “That is satisfactory so far as Mr. Lydgate is concerned, Camden,” said
10569: the old lady, with an air of precision.—“But as to Bulstrode—the report
10570: may be true of some other son.”
10571: 
10572: 
10573: 
10574: 
10575: CHAPTER XXVII.
10576: 
10577: Let the high Muse chant loves Olympian:
10578: We are but mortals, and must sing of man.
10579: 
10580: 
10581: An eminent philosopher among my friends, who can dignify even your ugly
10582: furniture by lifting it into the serene light of science, has shown me
10583: this pregnant little fact. Your pier-glass or extensive surface of
10584: polished steel made to be rubbed by a housemaid, will be minutely and
10585: multitudinously scratched in all directions; but place now against it a
10586: lighted candle as a centre of illumination, and lo! the scratches will
10587: seem to arrange themselves in a fine series of concentric circles round
10588: that little sun. It is demonstrable that the scratches are going
10589: everywhere impartially and it is only your candle which produces the
10590: flattering illusion of a concentric arrangement, its light falling with
10591: an exclusive optical selection. These things are a parable. The
10592: scratches are events, and the candle is the egoism of any person now
10593: absent—of Miss Vincy, for example. Rosamond had a Providence of her own
10594: who had kindly made her more charming than other girls, and who seemed
10595: to have arranged Fred’s illness and Mr. Wrench’s mistake in order to
10596: bring her and Lydgate within effective proximity. It would have been to
10597: contravene these arrangements if Rosamond had consented to go away to
10598: Stone Court or elsewhere, as her parents wished her to do, especially
10599: since Mr. Lydgate thought the precaution needless. Therefore, while
10600: Miss Morgan and the children were sent away to a farmhouse the morning
10601: after Fred’s illness had declared itself, Rosamond refused to leave
10602: papa and mamma.
10603: 
10604: Poor mamma indeed was an object to touch any creature born of woman;
10605: and Mr. Vincy, who doted on his wife, was more alarmed on her account
10606: than on Fred’s. But for his insistence she would have taken no rest:
10607: her brightness was all bedimmed; unconscious of her costume which had
10608: always been so fresh and gay, she was like a sick bird with languid eye
10609: and plumage ruffled, her senses dulled to the sights and sounds that
10610: used most to interest her. Fred’s delirium, in which he seemed to be
10611: wandering out of her reach, tore her heart. After her first outburst
10612: against Mr. Wrench she went about very quietly: her one low cry was to
10613: Lydgate. She would follow him out of the room and put her hand on his
10614: arm moaning out, “Save my boy.” Once she pleaded, “He has always been
10615: good to me, Mr. Lydgate: he never had a hard word for his mother,”—as
10616: if poor Fred’s suffering were an accusation against him. All the
10617: deepest fibres of the mother’s memory were stirred, and the young man
10618: whose voice took a gentler tone when he spoke to her, was one with the
10619: babe whom she had loved, with a love new to her, before he was born.
10620: 
10621: “I have good hope, Mrs. Vincy,” Lydgate would say. “Come down with me
10622: and let us talk about the food.” In that way he led her to the parlor
10623: where Rosamond was, and made a change for her, surprising her into
10624: taking some tea or broth which had been prepared for her. There was a
10625: constant understanding between him and Rosamond on these matters. He
10626: almost always saw her before going to the sickroom, and she appealed to
10627: him as to what she could do for mamma. Her presence of mind and
10628: adroitness in carrying out his hints were admirable, and it is not
10629: wonderful that the idea of seeing Rosamond began to mingle itself with
10630: his interest in the case. Especially when the critical stage was
10631: passed, and he began to feel confident of Fred’s recovery. In the more
10632: doubtful time, he had advised calling in Dr. Sprague (who, if he could,
10633: would rather have remained neutral on Wrench’s account); but after two
10634: consultations, the conduct of the case was left to Lydgate, and there
10635: was every reason to make him assiduous. Morning and evening he was at
10636: Mr. Vincy’s, and gradually the visits became cheerful as Fred became
10637: simply feeble, and lay not only in need of the utmost petting but
10638: conscious of it, so that Mrs. Vincy felt as if, after all, the illness
10639: had made a festival for her tenderness.
10640: 
10641: Both father and mother held it an added reason for good spirits, when
10642: old Mr. Featherstone sent messages by Lydgate, saying that Fred must
10643: make haste and get well, as he, Peter Featherstone, could not do
10644: without him, and missed his visits sadly. The old man himself was
10645: getting bedridden. Mrs. Vincy told these messages to Fred when he could
10646: listen, and he turned towards her his delicate, pinched face, from
10647: which all the thick blond hair had been cut away, and in which the eyes
10648: seemed to have got larger, yearning for some word about Mary—wondering
10649: what she felt about his illness. No word passed his lips; but “to hear
10650: with eyes belongs to love’s rare wit,” and the mother in the fulness of
10651: her heart not only divined Fred’s longing, but felt ready for any
10652: sacrifice in order to satisfy him.
10653: 
10654: “If I can only see my boy strong again,” she said, in her loving folly;
10655: “and who knows?—perhaps master of Stone Court! and he can marry anybody
10656: he likes then.”
10657: 
10658: “Not if they won’t have me, mother,” said Fred. The illness had made
10659: him childish, and tears came as he spoke.
10660: 
10661: “Oh, take a bit of jelly, my dear,” said Mrs. Vincy, secretly
10662: incredulous of any such refusal.
10663: 
10664: She never left Fred’s side when her husband was not in the house, and
10665: thus Rosamond was in the unusual position of being much alone. Lydgate,
10666: naturally, never thought of staying long with her, yet it seemed that
10667: the brief impersonal conversations they had together were creating that
10668: peculiar intimacy which consists in shyness. They were obliged to look
10669: at each other in speaking, and somehow the looking could not be carried
10670: through as the matter of course which it really was. Lydgate began to
10671: feel this sort of consciousness unpleasant and one day looked down, or
10672: anywhere, like an ill-worked puppet. But this turned out badly: the
10673: next day, Rosamond looked down, and the consequence was that when their
10674: eyes met again, both were more conscious than before. There was no help
10675: for this in science, and as Lydgate did not want to flirt, there seemed
10676: to be no help for it in folly. It was therefore a relief when neighbors
10677: no longer considered the house in quarantine, and when the chances of
10678: seeing Rosamond alone were very much reduced.
10679: 
10680: But that intimacy of mutual embarrassment, in which each feels that the
10681: other is feeling something, having once existed, its effect is not to
10682: be done away with. Talk about the weather and other well-bred topics is
10683: apt to seem a hollow device, and behavior can hardly become easy unless
10684: it frankly recognizes a mutual fascination—which of course need not
10685: mean anything deep or serious. This was the way in which Rosamond and
10686: Lydgate slid gracefully into ease, and made their intercourse lively
10687: again. Visitors came and went as usual, there was once more music in
10688: the drawing-room, and all the extra hospitality of Mr. Vincy’s
10689: mayoralty returned. Lydgate, whenever he could, took his seat by
10690: Rosamond’s side, and lingered to hear her music, calling himself her
10691: captive—meaning, all the while, not to be her captive. The
10692: preposterousness of the notion that he could at once set up a
10693: satisfactory establishment as a married man was a sufficient guarantee
10694: against danger. This play at being a little in love was agreeable, and
10695: did not interfere with graver pursuits. Flirtation, after all, was not
10696: necessarily a singeing process. Rosamond, for her part, had never
10697: enjoyed the days so much in her life before: she was sure of being
10698: admired by some one worth captivating, and she did not distinguish
10699: flirtation from love, either in herself or in another. She seemed to be
10700: sailing with a fair wind just whither she would go, and her thoughts
10701: were much occupied with a handsome house in Lowick Gate which she hoped
10702: would by-and-by be vacant. She was quite determined, when she was
10703: married, to rid herself adroitly of all the visitors who were not
10704: agreeable to her at her father’s; and she imagined the drawing-room in
10705: her favorite house with various styles of furniture.
10706: 
10707: Certainly her thoughts were much occupied with Lydgate himself; he
10708: seemed to her almost perfect: if he had known his notes so that his
10709: enchantment under her music had been less like an emotional elephant’s,
10710: and if he had been able to discriminate better the refinements of her
10711: taste in dress, she could hardly have mentioned a deficiency in him.
10712: How different he was from young Plymdale or Mr. Caius Larcher! Those
10713: young men had not a notion of French, and could speak on no subject
10714: with striking knowledge, except perhaps the dyeing and carrying trades,
10715: which of course they were ashamed to mention; they were Middlemarch
10716: gentry, elated with their silver-headed whips and satin stocks, but
10717: embarrassed in their manners, and timidly jocose: even Fred was above
10718: them, having at least the accent and manner of a university man.
10719: Whereas Lydgate was always listened to, bore himself with the careless
10720: politeness of conscious superiority, and seemed to have the right
10721: clothes on by a certain natural affinity, without ever having to think
10722: about them. Rosamond was proud when he entered the room, and when he
10723: approached her with a distinguishing smile, she had a delicious sense
10724: that she was the object of enviable homage. If Lydgate had been aware
10725: of all the pride he excited in that delicate bosom, he might have been
10726: just as well pleased as any other man, even the most densely ignorant
10727: of humoral pathology or fibrous tissue: he held it one of the prettiest
10728: attitudes of the feminine mind to adore a man’s pre-eminence without
10729: too precise a knowledge of what it consisted in. But Rosamond was not
10730: one of those helpless girls who betray themselves unawares, and whose
10731: behavior is awkwardly driven by their impulses, instead of being
10732: steered by wary grace and propriety. Do you imagine that her rapid
10733: forecast and rumination concerning house-furniture and society were
10734: ever discernible in her conversation, even with her mamma? On the
10735: contrary, she would have expressed the prettiest surprise and
10736: disapprobation if she had heard that another young lady had been
10737: detected in that immodest prematureness—indeed, would probably have
10738: disbelieved in its possibility. For Rosamond never showed any
10739: unbecoming knowledge, and was always that combination of correct
10740: sentiments, music, dancing, drawing, elegant note-writing, private
10741: album for extracted verse, and perfect blond loveliness, which made the
10742: irresistible woman for the doomed man of that date. Think no unfair
10743: evil of her, pray: she had no wicked plots, nothing sordid or
10744: mercenary; in fact, she never thought of money except as something
10745: necessary which other people would always provide. She was not in the
10746: habit of devising falsehoods, and if her statements were no direct clew
10747: to fact, why, they were not intended in that light—they were among her
10748: elegant accomplishments, intended to please. Nature had inspired many
10749: arts in finishing Mrs. Lemon’s favorite pupil, who by general consent
10750: (Fred’s excepted) was a rare compound of beauty, cleverness, and
10751: amiability.
10752: 
10753: Lydgate found it more and more agreeable to be with her, and there was
10754: no constraint now, there was a delightful interchange of influence in
10755: their eyes, and what they said had that superfluity of meaning for
10756: them, which is observable with some sense of flatness by a third
10757: person; still they had no interviews or asides from which a third
10758: person need have been excluded. In fact, they flirted; and Lydgate was
10759: secure in the belief that they did nothing else. If a man could not
10760: love and be wise, surely he could flirt and be wise at the same time?
10761: Really, the men in Middlemarch, except Mr. Farebrother, were great
10762: bores, and Lydgate did not care about commercial politics or cards:
10763: what was he to do for relaxation? He was often invited to the
10764: Bulstrodes’; but the girls there were hardly out of the schoolroom; and
10765: Mrs. Bulstrode’s _naive_ way of conciliating piety and worldliness, the
10766: nothingness of this life and the desirability of cut glass, the
10767: consciousness at once of filthy rags and the best damask, was not a
10768: sufficient relief from the weight of her husband’s invariable
10769: seriousness. The Vincys’ house, with all its faults, was the pleasanter
10770: by contrast; besides, it nourished Rosamond—sweet to look at as a
10771: half-opened blush-rose, and adorned with accomplishments for the
10772: refined amusement of man.
10773: 
10774: But he made some enemies, other than medical, by his success with Miss
10775: Vincy. One evening he came into the drawing-room rather late, when
10776: several other visitors were there. The card-table had drawn off the
10777: elders, and Mr. Ned Plymdale (one of the good matches in Middlemarch,
10778: though not one of its leading minds) was in _tête-à-tête_ with
10779: Rosamond. He had brought the last “Keepsake,” the gorgeous watered-silk
10780: publication which marked modern progress at that time; and he
10781: considered himself very fortunate that he could be the first to look
10782: over it with her, dwelling on the ladies and gentlemen with shiny
10783: copper-plate cheeks and copper-plate smiles, and pointing to comic
10784: verses as capital and sentimental stories as interesting. Rosamond was
10785: gracious, and Mr. Ned was satisfied that he had the very best thing in
10786: art and literature as a medium for “paying addresses”—the very thing to
10787: please a nice girl. He had also reasons, deep rather than ostensible,
10788: for being satisfied with his own appearance. To superficial observers
10789: his chin had too vanishing an aspect, looking as if it were being
10790: gradually reabsorbed. And it did indeed cause him some difficulty about
10791: the fit of his satin stocks, for which chins were at that time useful.
10792: 
10793: “I think the Honorable Mrs. S. is something like you,” said Mr. Ned. He
10794: kept the book open at the bewitching portrait, and looked at it rather
10795: languishingly.
10796: 
10797: “Her back is very large; she seems to have sat for that,” said
10798: Rosamond, not meaning any satire, but thinking how red young Plymdale’s
10799: hands were, and wondering why Lydgate did not come. She went on with
10800: her tatting all the while.
10801: 
10802: “I did not say she was as beautiful as you are,” said Mr. Ned,
10803: venturing to look from the portrait to its rival.
10804: 
10805: “I suspect you of being an adroit flatterer,” said Rosamond, feeling
10806: sure that she should have to reject this young gentleman a second time.
10807: 
10808: But now Lydgate came in; the book was closed before he reached
10809: Rosamond’s corner, and as he took his seat with easy confidence on the
10810: other side of her, young Plymdale’s jaw fell like a barometer towards
10811: the cheerless side of change. Rosamond enjoyed not only Lydgate’s
10812: presence but its effect: she liked to excite jealousy.
10813: 
10814: “What a late comer you are!” she said, as they shook hands. “Mamma had
10815: given you up a little while ago. How do you find Fred?”
10816: 
10817: “As usual; going on well, but slowly. I want him to go away—to Stone
10818: Court, for example. But your mamma seems to have some objection.”
10819: 
10820: “Poor fellow!” said Rosamond, prettily. “You will see Fred so changed,”
10821: she added, turning to the other suitor; “we have looked to Mr. Lydgate
10822: as our guardian angel during this illness.”
10823: 
10824: Mr. Ned smiled nervously, while Lydgate, drawing the “Keepsake” towards
10825: him and opening it, gave a short scornful laugh and tossed up his chin,
10826: as if in wonderment at human folly.
10827: 
10828: “What are you laughing at so profanely?” said Rosamond, with bland
10829: neutrality.
10830: 
10831: “I wonder which would turn out to be the silliest—the engravings or the
10832: writing here,” said Lydgate, in his most convinced tone, while he
10833: turned over the pages quickly, seeming to see all through the book in
10834: no time, and showing his large white hands to much advantage, as
10835: Rosamond thought. “Do look at this bridegroom coming out of church: did
10836: you ever see such a ‘sugared invention’—as the Elizabethans used to
10837: say? Did any haberdasher ever look so smirking? Yet I will answer for
10838: it the story makes him one of the first gentlemen in the land.”
10839: 
10840: “You are so severe, I am frightened at you,” said Rosamond, keeping her
10841: amusement duly moderate. Poor young Plymdale had lingered with
10842: admiration over this very engraving, and his spirit was stirred.
10843: 
10844: “There are a great many celebrated people writing in the ‘Keepsake,’ at
10845: all events,” he said, in a tone at once piqued and timid. “This is the
10846: first time I have heard it called silly.”
10847: 
10848: “I think I shall turn round on you and accuse you of being a Goth,”
10849: said Rosamond, looking at Lydgate with a smile. “I suspect you know
10850: nothing about Lady Blessington and L. E. L.” Rosamond herself was not
10851: without relish for these writers, but she did not readily commit
10852: herself by admiration, and was alive to the slightest hint that
10853: anything was not, according to Lydgate, in the very highest taste.
10854: 
10855: “But Sir Walter Scott—I suppose Mr. Lydgate knows him,” said young
10856: Plymdale, a little cheered by this advantage.
10857: 
10858: “Oh, I read no literature now,” said Lydgate, shutting the book, and
10859: pushing it away. “I read so much when I was a lad, that I suppose it
10860: will last me all my life. I used to know Scott’s poems by heart.”
10861: 
10862: “I should like to know when you left off,” said Rosamond, “because then
10863: I might be sure that I knew something which you did not know.”
10864: 
10865: “Mr. Lydgate would say that was not worth knowing,” said Mr. Ned,
10866: purposely caustic.
10867: 
10868: “On the contrary,” said Lydgate, showing no smart; but smiling with
10869: exasperating confidence at Rosamond. “It would be worth knowing by the
10870: fact that Miss Vincy could tell it me.”
10871: 
10872: Young Plymdale soon went to look at the whist-playing, thinking that
10873: Lydgate was one of the most conceited, unpleasant fellows it had ever
10874: been his ill-fortune to meet.
10875: 
10876: “How rash you are!” said Rosamond, inwardly delighted. “Do you see that
10877: you have given offence?”
10878: 
10879: “What! is it Mr. Plymdale’s book? I am sorry. I didn’t think about it.”
10880: 
10881: “I shall begin to admit what you said of yourself when you first came
10882: here—that you are a bear, and want teaching by the birds.”
10883: 
10884: “Well, there is a bird who can teach me what she will. Don’t I listen
10885: to her willingly?”
10886: 
10887: To Rosamond it seemed as if she and Lydgate were as good as engaged.
10888: That they were some time to be engaged had long been an idea in her
10889: mind; and ideas, we know, tend to a more solid kind of existence, the
10890: necessary materials being at hand. It is true, Lydgate had the
10891: counter-idea of remaining unengaged; but this was a mere negative, a
10892: shadow cast by other resolves which themselves were capable of
10893: shrinking. Circumstance was almost sure to be on the side of Rosamond’s
10894: idea, which had a shaping activity and looked through watchful blue
10895: eyes, whereas Lydgate’s lay blind and unconcerned as a jelly-fish which
10896: gets melted without knowing it.
10897: 
10898: That evening when he went home, he looked at his phials to see how a
10899: process of maceration was going on, with undisturbed interest; and he
10900: wrote out his daily notes with as much precision as usual. The reveries
10901: from which it was difficult for him to detach himself were ideal
10902: constructions of something else than Rosamond’s virtues, and the
10903: primitive tissue was still his fair unknown. Moreover, he was beginning
10904: to feel some zest for the growing though half-suppressed feud between
10905: him and the other medical men, which was likely to become more
10906: manifest, now that Bulstrode’s method of managing the new hospital was
10907: about to be declared; and there were various inspiriting signs that his
10908: non-acceptance by some of Peacock’s patients might be counterbalanced
10909: by the impression he had produced in other quarters. Only a few days
10910: later, when he had happened to overtake Rosamond on the Lowick road and
10911: had got down from his horse to walk by her side until he had quite
10912: protected her from a passing drove, he had been stopped by a servant on
10913: horseback with a message calling him in to a house of some importance
10914: where Peacock had never attended; and it was the second instance of
10915: this kind. The servant was Sir James Chettam’s, and the house was
10916: Lowick Manor.
10917: 
10918: 
10919: 
10920: 
10921: CHAPTER XXVIII.
10922: 
10923: 1_st Gent_. All times are good to seek your wedded home
10924:     Bringing a mutual delight.
10925: 
10926: 2_d Gent_. Why, true.
10927:     The calendar hath not an evil day
10928:     For souls made one by love, and even death
10929:     Were sweetness, if it came like rolling waves
10930:     While they two clasped each other, and foresaw
10931:     No life apart.
10932: 
10933: 
10934: Mr. and Mrs. Casaubon, returning from their wedding journey, arrived at
10935: Lowick Manor in the middle of January. A light snow was falling as they
10936: descended at the door, and in the morning, when Dorothea passed from
10937: her dressing-room into the blue-green boudoir that we know of, she saw
10938: the long avenue of limes lifting their trunks from a white earth, and
10939: spreading white branches against the dun and motionless sky. The
10940: distant flat shrank in uniform whiteness and low-hanging uniformity of
10941: cloud. The very furniture in the room seemed to have shrunk since she
10942: saw it before: the stag in the tapestry looked more like a ghost in his
10943: ghostly blue-green world; the volumes of polite literature in the
10944: bookcase looked more like immovable imitations of books. The bright
10945: fire of dry oak-boughs burning on the logs seemed an incongruous
10946: renewal of life and glow—like the figure of Dorothea herself as she
10947: entered carrying the red-leather cases containing the cameos for Celia.
10948: 
10949: She was glowing from her morning toilet as only healthful youth can
10950: glow: there was gem-like brightness on her coiled hair and in her hazel
10951: eyes; there was warm red life in her lips; her throat had a breathing
10952: whiteness above the differing white of the fur which itself seemed to
10953: wind about her neck and cling down her blue-gray pelisse with a
10954: tenderness gathered from her own, a sentient commingled innocence which
10955: kept its loveliness against the crystalline purity of the outdoor snow.
10956: As she laid the cameo-cases on the table in the bow-window, she
10957: unconsciously kept her hands on them, immediately absorbed in looking
10958: out on the still, white enclosure which made her visible world.
10959: 
10960: Mr. Casaubon, who had risen early complaining of palpitation, was in
10961: the library giving audience to his curate Mr. Tucker. By-and-by Celia
10962: would come in her quality of bridesmaid as well as sister, and through
10963: the next weeks there would be wedding visits received and given; all in
10964: continuance of that transitional life understood to correspond with the
10965: excitement of bridal felicity, and keeping up the sense of busy
10966: ineffectiveness, as of a dream which the dreamer begins to suspect. The
10967: duties of her married life, contemplated as so great beforehand, seemed
10968: to be shrinking with the furniture and the white vapor-walled
10969: landscape. The clear heights where she expected to walk in full
10970: communion had become difficult to see even in her imagination; the
10971: delicious repose of the soul on a complete superior had been shaken
10972: into uneasy effort and alarmed with dim presentiment. When would the
10973: days begin of that active wifely devotion which was to strengthen her
10974: husband’s life and exalt her own? Never perhaps, as she had
10975: preconceived them; but somehow—still somehow. In this solemnly pledged
10976: union of her life, duty would present itself in some new form of
10977: inspiration and give a new meaning to wifely love.
10978: 
10979: Meanwhile there was the snow and the low arch of dun vapor—there was
10980: the stifling oppression of that gentlewoman’s world, where everything
10981: was done for her and none asked for her aid—where the sense of
10982: connection with a manifold pregnant existence had to be kept up
10983: painfully as an inward vision, instead of coming from without in claims
10984: that would have shaped her energies.— “What shall I do?” “Whatever you
10985: please, my dear:” that had been her brief history since she had left
10986: off learning morning lessons and practising silly rhythms on the hated
10987: piano. Marriage, which was to bring guidance into worthy and imperative
10988: occupation, had not yet freed her from the gentlewoman’s oppressive
10989: liberty: it had not even filled her leisure with the ruminant joy of
10990: unchecked tenderness. Her blooming full-pulsed youth stood there in a
10991: moral imprisonment which made itself one with the chill, colorless,
10992: narrowed landscape, with the shrunken furniture, the never-read books,
10993: and the ghostly stag in a pale fantastic world that seemed to be
10994: vanishing from the daylight.
10995: 
10996: In the first minutes when Dorothea looked out she felt nothing but the
10997: dreary oppression; then came a keen remembrance, and turning away from
10998: the window she walked round the room. The ideas and hopes which were
10999: living in her mind when she first saw this room nearly three months
11000: before were present now only as memories: she judged them as we judge
11001: transient and departed things. All existence seemed to beat with a
11002: lower pulse than her own, and her religious faith was a solitary cry,
11003: the struggle out of a nightmare in which every object was withering and
11004: shrinking away from her. Each remembered thing in the room was
11005: disenchanted, was deadened as an unlit transparency, till her wandering
11006: gaze came to the group of miniatures, and there at last she saw
11007: something which had gathered new breath and meaning: it was the
11008: miniature of Mr. Casaubon’s aunt Julia, who had made the unfortunate
11009: marriage—of Will Ladislaw’s grandmother. Dorothea could fancy that it
11010: was alive now—the delicate woman’s face which yet had a headstrong
11011: look, a peculiarity difficult to interpret. Was it only her friends who
11012: thought her marriage unfortunate? or did she herself find it out to be
11013: a mistake, and taste the salt bitterness of her tears in the merciful
11014: silence of the night? What breadths of experience Dorothea seemed to
11015: have passed over since she first looked at this miniature! She felt a
11016: new companionship with it, as if it had an ear for her and could see
11017: how she was looking at it. Here was a woman who had known some
11018: difficulty about marriage. Nay, the colors deepened, the lips and chin
11019: seemed to get larger, the hair and eyes seemed to be sending out light,
11020: the face was masculine and beamed on her with that full gaze which
11021: tells her on whom it falls that she is too interesting for the
11022: slightest movement of her eyelid to pass unnoticed and uninterpreted.
11023: The vivid presentation came like a pleasant glow to Dorothea: she felt
11024: herself smiling, and turning from the miniature sat down and looked up
11025: as if she were again talking to a figure in front of her. But the smile
11026: disappeared as she went on meditating, and at last she said aloud—
11027: 
11028: “Oh, it was cruel to speak so! How sad—how dreadful!”
11029: 
11030: She rose quickly and went out of the room, hurrying along the corridor,
11031: with the irresistible impulse to go and see her husband and inquire if
11032: she could do anything for him. Perhaps Mr. Tucker was gone and Mr.
11033: Casaubon was alone in the library. She felt as if all her morning’s
11034: gloom would vanish if she could see her husband glad because of her
11035: presence.
11036: 
11037: But when she reached the head of the dark oak there was Celia coming
11038: up, and below there was Mr. Brooke, exchanging welcomes and
11039: congratulations with Mr. Casaubon.
11040: 
11041: “Dodo!” said Celia, in her quiet staccato; then kissed her sister,
11042: whose arms encircled her, and said no more. I think they both cried a
11043: little in a furtive manner, while Dorothea ran down-stairs to greet her
11044: uncle.
11045: 
11046: “I need not ask how you are, my dear,” said Mr. Brooke, after kissing
11047: her forehead. “Rome has agreed with you, I see—happiness, frescos, the
11048: antique—that sort of thing. Well, it’s very pleasant to have you back
11049: again, and you understand all about art now, eh? But Casaubon is a
11050: little pale, I tell him—a little pale, you know. Studying hard in his
11051: holidays is carrying it rather too far. I overdid it at one time”—Mr.
11052: Brooke still held Dorothea’s hand, but had turned his face to Mr.
11053: Casaubon—“about topography, ruins, temples—I thought I had a clew, but
11054: I saw it would carry me too far, and nothing might come of it. You may
11055: go any length in that sort of thing, and nothing may come of it, you
11056: know.”
11057: 
11058: Dorothea’s eyes also were turned up to her husband’s face with some
11059: anxiety at the idea that those who saw him afresh after absence might
11060: be aware of signs which she had not noticed.
11061: 
11062: “Nothing to alarm you, my dear,” said Mr. Brooke, observing her
11063: expression. “A little English beef and mutton will soon make a
11064: difference. It was all very well to look pale, sitting for the portrait
11065: of Aquinas, you know—we got your letter just in time. But Aquinas,
11066: now—he was a little too subtle, wasn’t he? Does anybody read Aquinas?”
11067: 
11068: “He is not indeed an author adapted to superficial minds,” said Mr.
11069: Casaubon, meeting these timely questions with dignified patience.
11070: 
11071: “You would like coffee in your own room, uncle?” said Dorothea, coming
11072: to the rescue.
11073: 
11074: “Yes; and you must go to Celia: she has great news to tell you, you
11075: know. I leave it all to her.”
11076: 
11077: The blue-green boudoir looked much more cheerful when Celia was seated
11078: there in a pelisse exactly like her sister’s, surveying the cameos with
11079: a placid satisfaction, while the conversation passed on to other
11080: topics.
11081: 
11082: “Do you think it nice to go to Rome on a wedding journey?” said Celia,
11083: with her ready delicate blush which Dorothea was used to on the
11084: smallest occasions.
11085: 
11086: “It would not suit all—not you, dear, for example,” said Dorothea,
11087: quietly. No one would ever know what she thought of a wedding journey
11088: to Rome.
11089: 
11090: “Mrs. Cadwallader says it is nonsense, people going a long journey when
11091: they are married. She says they get tired to death of each other, and
11092: can’t quarrel comfortably, as they would at home. And Lady Chettam says
11093: she went to Bath.” Celia’s color changed again and again—seemed
11094: 
11095: “To come and go with tidings from the heart,
11096: As it a running messenger had been.”
11097: 
11098: 
11099: It must mean more than Celia’s blushing usually did.
11100: 
11101: “Celia! has something happened?” said Dorothea, in a tone full of
11102: sisterly feeling. “Have you really any great news to tell me?”
11103: 
11104: “It was because you went away, Dodo. Then there was nobody but me for
11105: Sir James to talk to,” said Celia, with a certain roguishness in her
11106: eyes.
11107: 
11108: “I understand. It is as I used to hope and believe,” said Dorothea,
11109: taking her sister’s face between her hands, and looking at her half
11110: anxiously. Celia’s marriage seemed more serious than it used to do.
11111: 
11112: “It was only three days ago,” said Celia. “And Lady Chettam is very
11113: kind.”
11114: 
11115: “And you are very happy?”
11116: 
11117: “Yes. We are not going to be married yet. Because every thing is to be
11118: got ready. And I don’t want to be married so very soon, because I think
11119: it is nice to be engaged. And we shall be married all our lives after.”
11120: 
11121: “I do believe you could not marry better, Kitty. Sir James is a good,
11122: honorable man,” said Dorothea, warmly.
11123: 
11124: “He has gone on with the cottages, Dodo. He will tell you about them
11125: when he comes. Shall you be glad to see him?”
11126: 
11127: “Of course I shall. How can you ask me?”
11128: 
11129: “Only I was afraid you would be getting so learned,” said Celia,
11130: regarding Mr. Casaubon’s learning as a kind of damp which might in due
11131: time saturate a neighboring body.
11132:

11135: 
11136: CHAPTER XXIX.
11137: 
11138: I found that no genius in another could please me. My unfortunate
11139: paradoxes had entirely dried up that source of comfort.—GOLDSMITH.
11140: 
11141: 
11142: One morning, some weeks after her arrival at Lowick, Dorothea—but why
11143: always Dorothea? Was her point of view the only possible one with
11144: regard to this marriage? I protest against all our interest, all our
11145: effort at understanding being given to the young skins that look
11146: blooming in spite of trouble; for these too will get faded, and will
11147: know the older and more eating griefs which we are helping to neglect.
11148: In spite of the blinking eyes and white moles objectionable to Celia,
11149: and the want of muscular curve which was morally painful to Sir James,
11150: Mr. Casaubon had an intense consciousness within him, and was
11151: spiritually a-hungered like the rest of us. He had done nothing
11152: exceptional in marrying—nothing but what society sanctions, and
11153: considers an occasion for wreaths and bouquets. It had occurred to him
11154: that he must not any longer defer his intention of matrimony, and he
11155: had reflected that in taking a wife, a man of good position should
11156: expect and carefully choose a blooming young lady—the younger the
11157: better, because more educable and submissive—of a rank equal to his
11158: own, of religious principles, virtuous disposition, and good
11159: understanding. On such a young lady he would make handsome settlements,
11160: and he would neglect no arrangement for her happiness: in return, he
11161: should receive family pleasures and leave behind him that copy of
11162: himself which seemed so urgently required of a man—to the sonneteers of
11163: the sixteenth century. Times had altered since then, and no sonneteer
11164: had insisted on Mr. Casaubon’s leaving a copy of himself; moreover, he
11165: had not yet succeeded in issuing copies of his mythological key; but he
11166: had always intended to acquit himself by marriage, and the sense that
11167: he was fast leaving the years behind him, that the world was getting
11168: dimmer and that he felt lonely, was a reason to him for losing no more
11169: time in overtaking domestic delights before they too were left behind
11170: by the years.
11171: 
11172: And when he had seen Dorothea he believed that he had found even more
11173: than he demanded: she might really be such a helpmate to him as would
11174: enable him to dispense with a hired secretary, an aid which Mr.
11175: Casaubon had never yet employed and had a suspicious dread of. (Mr.
11176: Casaubon was nervously conscious that he was expected to manifest a
11177: powerful mind.) Providence, in its kindness, had supplied him with the
11178: wife he needed. A wife, a modest young lady, with the purely
11179: appreciative, unambitious abilities of her sex, is sure to think her
11180: husband’s mind powerful. Whether Providence had taken equal care of
11181: Miss Brooke in presenting her with Mr. Casaubon was an idea which could
11182: hardly occur to him. Society never made the preposterous demand that a
11183: man should think as much about his own qualifications for making a
11184: charming girl happy as he thinks of hers for making himself happy. As
11185: if a man could choose not only his wife but his wife’s husband! Or as
11186: if he were bound to provide charms for his posterity in his own
11187: person!— When Dorothea accepted him with effusion, that was only
11188: natural; and Mr. Casaubon believed that his happiness was going to
11189: begin.
11190: 
11191: He had not had much foretaste of happiness in his previous life. To
11192: know intense joy without a strong bodily frame, one must have an
11193: enthusiastic soul. Mr. Casaubon had never had a strong bodily frame,
11194: and his soul was sensitive without being enthusiastic: it was too
11195: languid to thrill out of self-consciousness into passionate delight; it
11196: went on fluttering in the swampy ground where it was hatched, thinking
11197: of its wings and never flying. His experience was of that pitiable kind
11198: which shrinks from pity, and fears most of all that it should be known:
11199: it was that proud narrow sensitiveness which has not mass enough to
11200: spare for transformation into sympathy, and quivers thread-like in
11201: small currents of self-preoccupation or at best of an egoistic
11202: scrupulosity. And Mr. Casaubon had many scruples: he was capable of a
11203: severe self-restraint; he was resolute in being a man of honor
11204: according to the code; he would be unimpeachable by any recognized
11205: opinion. In conduct these ends had been attained; but the difficulty of
11206: making his Key to all Mythologies unimpeachable weighed like lead upon
11207: his mind; and the pamphlets—or “Parerga” as he called them—by which he
11208: tested his public and deposited small monumental records of his march,
11209: were far from having been seen in all their significance. He suspected
11210: the Archdeacon of not having read them; he was in painful doubt as to
11211: what was really thought of them by the leading minds of Brasenose, and
11212: bitterly convinced that his old acquaintance Carp had been the writer
11213: of that depreciatory recension which was kept locked in a small drawer
11214: of Mr. Casaubon’s desk, and also in a dark closet of his verbal memory.
11215: These were heavy impressions to struggle against, and brought that
11216: melancholy embitterment which is the consequence of all excessive
11217: claim: even his religious faith wavered with his wavering trust in his
11218: own authorship, and the consolations of the Christian hope in
11219: immortality seemed to lean on the immortality of the still unwritten
11220: Key to all Mythologies. For my part I am very sorry for him. It is an
11221: uneasy lot at best, to be what we call highly taught and yet not to
11222: enjoy: to be present at this great spectacle of life and never to be
11223: liberated from a small hungry shivering self—never to be fully
11224: possessed by the glory we behold, never to have our consciousness
11225: rapturously transformed into the vividness of a thought, the ardor of a
11226: passion, the energy of an action, but always to be scholarly and
11227: uninspired, ambitious and timid, scrupulous and dim-sighted. Becoming a
11228: dean or even a bishop would make little difference, I fear, to Mr.
11229: Casaubon’s uneasiness. Doubtless some ancient Greek has observed that
11230: behind the big mask and the speaking-trumpet, there must always be our
11231: poor little eyes peeping as usual and our timorous lips more or less
11232: under anxious control.
11233: 
11234: To this mental estate mapped out a quarter of a century before, to
11235: sensibilities thus fenced in, Mr. Casaubon had thought of annexing
11236: happiness with a lovely young bride; but even before marriage, as we
11237: have seen, he found himself under a new depression in the consciousness
11238: that the new bliss was not blissful to him. Inclination yearned back to
11239: its old, easier custom. And the deeper he went in domesticity the more
11240: did the sense of acquitting himself and acting with propriety
11241: predominate over any other satisfaction. Marriage, like religion and
11242: erudition, nay, like authorship itself, was fated to become an outward
11243: requirement, and Edward Casaubon was bent on fulfilling unimpeachably
11244: all requirements. Even drawing Dorothea into use in his study,
11245: according to his own intention before marriage, was an effort which he
11246: was always tempted to defer, and but for her pleading insistence it
11247: might never have begun. But she had succeeded in making it a matter of
11248: course that she should take her place at an early hour in the library
11249: and have work either of reading aloud or copying assigned her. The work
11250: had been easier to define because Mr. Casaubon had adopted an immediate
11251: intention: there was to be a new Parergon, a small monograph on some
11252: lately traced indications concerning the Egyptian mysteries whereby
11253: certain assertions of Warburton’s could be corrected. References were
11254: extensive even here, but not altogether shoreless; and sentences were
11255: actually to be written in the shape wherein they would be scanned by
11256: Brasenose and a less formidable posterity. These minor monumental
11257: productions were always exciting to Mr. Casaubon; digestion was made
11258: difficult by the interference of citations, or by the rivalry of
11259: dialectical phrases ringing against each other in his brain. And from
11260: the first there was to be a Latin dedication about which everything was
11261: uncertain except that it was not to be addressed to Carp: it was a
11262: poisonous regret to Mr. Casaubon that he had once addressed a
11263: dedication to Carp in which he had numbered that member of the animal
11264: kingdom among the _viros nullo ævo perituros_, a mistake which would
11265: infallibly lay the dedicator open to ridicule in the next age, and
11266: might even be chuckled over by Pike and Tench in the present.
11267: 
11268: Thus Mr. Casaubon was in one of his busiest epochs, and as I began to
11269: say a little while ago, Dorothea joined him early in the library where
11270: he had breakfasted alone. Celia at this time was on a second visit to
11271: Lowick, probably the last before her marriage, and was in the
11272: drawing-room expecting Sir James.
11273: 
11274: Dorothea had learned to read the signs of her husband’s mood, and she
11275: saw that the morning had become more foggy there during the last hour.
11276: She was going silently to her desk when he said, in that distant tone
11277: which implied that he was discharging a disagreeable duty—
11278: 
11279: “Dorothea, here is a letter for you, which was enclosed in one
11280: addressed to me.”
11281: 
11282: It was a letter of two pages, and she immediately looked at the
11283: signature.
11284: 
11285: “Mr. Ladislaw! What can he have to say to me?” she exclaimed, in a tone
11286: of pleased surprise. “But,” she added, looking at Mr. Casaubon, “I can
11287: imagine what he has written to you about.”
11288: 
11289: “You can, if you please, read the letter,” said Mr. Casaubon, severely
11290: pointing to it with his pen, and not looking at her. “But I may as well
11291: say beforehand, that I must decline the proposal it contains to pay a
11292: visit here. I trust I may be excused for desiring an interval of
11293: complete freedom from such distractions as have been hitherto
11294: inevitable, and especially from guests whose desultory vivacity makes
11295: their presence a fatigue.”
11296: 
11297: There had been no clashing of temper between Dorothea and her husband
11298: since that little explosion in Rome, which had left such strong traces
11299: in her mind that it had been easier ever since to quell emotion than to
11300: incur the consequence of venting it. But this ill-tempered anticipation
11301: that she could desire visits which might be disagreeable to her
11302: husband, this gratuitous defence of himself against selfish complaint
11303: on her part, was too sharp a sting to be meditated on until after it
11304: had been resented. Dorothea had thought that she could have been
11305: patient with John Milton, but she had never imagined him behaving in
11306: this way; and for a moment Mr. Casaubon seemed to be stupidly
11307: undiscerning and odiously unjust. Pity, that “new-born babe” which was
11308: by-and-by to rule many a storm within her, did not “stride the blast”
11309: on this occasion. With her first words, uttered in a tone that shook
11310: him, she startled Mr. Casaubon into looking at her, and meeting the
11311: flash of her eyes.
11312: 
11313: “Why do you attribute to me a wish for anything that would annoy you?
11314: You speak to me as if I were something you had to contend against. Wait
11315: at least till I appear to consult my own pleasure apart from yours.”
11316: 
11317: “Dorothea, you are hasty,” answered Mr. Casaubon, nervously.
11318: 
11319: Decidedly, this woman was too young to be on the formidable level of
11320: wifehood—unless she had been pale and featureless and taken everything
11321: for granted.
11322: 
11323: “I think it was you who were first hasty in your false suppositions
11324: about my feeling,” said Dorothea, in the same tone. The fire was not
11325: dissipated yet, and she thought it was ignoble in her husband not to
11326: apologize to her.
11327: 
11328: “We will, if you please, say no more on this subject, Dorothea. I have
11329: neither leisure nor energy for this kind of debate.”
11330: 
11331: Here Mr. Casaubon dipped his pen and made as if he would return to his
11332: writing, though his hand trembled so much that the words seemed to be
11333: written in an unknown character. There are answers which, in turning
11334: away wrath, only send it to the other end of the room, and to have a
11335: discussion coolly waived when you feel that justice is all on your own
11336: side is even more exasperating in marriage than in philosophy.
11337: 
11338: Dorothea left Ladislaw’s two letters unread on her husband’s
11339: writing-table and went to her own place, the scorn and indignation
11340: within her rejecting the reading of these letters, just as we hurl away
11341: any trash towards which we seem to have been suspected of mean
11342: cupidity. She did not in the least divine the subtle sources of her
11343: husband’s bad temper about these letters: she only knew that they had
11344: caused him to offend her. She began to work at once, and her hand did
11345: not tremble; on the contrary, in writing out the quotations which had
11346: been given to her the day before, she felt that she was forming her
11347: letters beautifully, and it seemed to her that she saw the construction
11348: of the Latin she was copying, and which she was beginning to
11349: understand, more clearly than usual. In her indignation there was a
11350: sense of superiority, but it went out for the present in firmness of
11351: stroke, and did not compress itself into an inward articulate voice
11352: pronouncing the once “affable archangel” a poor creature.
11353: 
11354: There had been this apparent quiet for half an hour, and Dorothea had
11355: not looked away from her own table, when she heard the loud bang of a
11356: book on the floor, and turning quickly saw Mr. Casaubon on the library
11357: steps clinging forward as if he were in some bodily distress. She
11358: started up and bounded towards him in an instant: he was evidently in
11359: great straits for breath. Jumping on a stool she got close to his elbow
11360: and said with her whole soul melted into tender alarm—
11361: 
11362: “Can you lean on me, dear?”
11363: 
11364: He was still for two or three minutes, which seemed endless to her,
11365: unable to speak or move, gasping for breath. When at last he descended
11366: the three steps and fell backward in the large chair which Dorothea had
11367: drawn close to the foot of the ladder, he no longer gasped but seemed
11368: helpless and about to faint. Dorothea rang the bell violently, and
11369: presently Mr. Casaubon was helped to the couch: he did not faint, and
11370: was gradually reviving, when Sir James Chettam came in, having been met
11371: in the hall with the news that Mr. Casaubon had “had a fit in the
11372: library.”
11373: 
11374: “Good God! this is just what might have been expected,” was his
11375: immediate thought. If his prophetic soul had been urged to
11376: particularize, it seemed to him that “fits” would have been the
11377: definite expression alighted upon. He asked his informant, the butler,
11378: whether the doctor had been sent for. The butler never knew his master
11379: to want the doctor before; but would it not be right to send for a
11380: physician?
11381: 
11382: When Sir James entered the library, however, Mr. Casaubon could make
11383: some signs of his usual politeness, and Dorothea, who in the reaction
11384: from her first terror had been kneeling and sobbing by his side now
11385: rose and herself proposed that some one should ride off for a medical
11386: man.
11387: 
11388: “I recommend you to send for Lydgate,” said Sir James. “My mother has
11389: called him in, and she has found him uncommonly clever. She has had a
11390: poor opinion of the physicians since my father’s death.”
11391: 
11392: Dorothea appealed to her husband, and he made a silent sign of
11393: approval. So Mr. Lydgate was sent for and he came wonderfully soon, for
11394: the messenger, who was Sir James Chettam’s man and knew Mr. Lydgate,
11395: met him leading his horse along the Lowick road and giving his arm to
11396: Miss Vincy.
11397: 
11398: Celia, in the drawing-room, had known nothing of the trouble till Sir
11399: James told her of it. After Dorothea’s account, he no longer considered
11400: the illness a fit, but still something “of that nature.”
11401: 
11402: “Poor dear Dodo—how dreadful!” said Celia, feeling as much grieved as
11403: her own perfect happiness would allow. Her little hands were clasped,
11404: and enclosed by Sir James’s as a bud is enfolded by a liberal calyx.
11405: “It is very shocking that Mr. Casaubon should be ill; but I never did
11406: like him. And I think he is not half fond enough of Dorothea; and he
11407: ought to be, for I am sure no one else would have had him—do you think
11408: they would?”
11409: 
11410: “I always thought it a horrible sacrifice of your sister,” said Sir
11411: James.
11412: 
11413: “Yes. But poor Dodo never did do what other people do, and I think she
11414: never will.”
11415: 
11416: “She is a noble creature,” said the loyal-hearted Sir James. He had
11417: just had a fresh impression of this kind, as he had seen Dorothea
11418: stretching her tender arm under her husband’s neck and looking at him
11419: with unspeakable sorrow. He did not know how much penitence there was
11420: in the sorrow.
11421: 
11422: “Yes,” said Celia, thinking it was very well for Sir James to say so,
11423: but _he_ would not have been comfortable with Dodo. “Shall I go to her?
11424: Could I help her, do you think?”
11425: 
11426: “I think it would be well for you just to go and see her before Lydgate
11427: comes,” said Sir James, magnanimously. “Only don’t stay long.”
11428: 
11429: While Celia was gone he walked up and down remembering what he had
11430: originally felt about Dorothea’s engagement, and feeling a revival of
11431: his disgust at Mr. Brooke’s indifference. If Cadwallader—if every one
11432: else had regarded the affair as he, Sir James, had done, the marriage
11433: might have been hindered. It was wicked to let a young girl blindly
11434: decide her fate in that way, without any effort to save her. Sir James
11435: had long ceased to have any regrets on his own account: his heart was
11436: satisfied with his engagement to Celia. But he had a chivalrous nature
11437: (was not the disinterested service of woman among the ideal glories of
11438: old chivalry?): his disregarded love had not turned to bitterness; its
11439: death had made sweet odors—floating memories that clung with a
11440: consecrating effect to Dorothea. He could remain her brotherly friend,
11441: interpreting her actions with generous trustfulness.
11442: 
11443: 
11444: 
11445: 
11446: CHAPTER XXX.
11447: 
11448: Qui veut délasser hors de propos, lasse.—PASCAL.
11449: 
11450: 
11451: Mr. Casaubon had no second attack of equal severity with the first, and
11452: in a few days began to recover his usual condition. But Lydgate seemed
11453: to think the case worth a great deal of attention. He not only used his
11454: stethoscope (which had not become a matter of course in practice at
11455: that time), but sat quietly by his patient and watched him. To Mr.
11456: Casaubon’s questions about himself, he replied that the source of the
11457: illness was the common error of intellectual men—a too eager and
11458: monotonous application: the remedy was, to be satisfied with moderate
11459: work, and to seek variety of relaxation. Mr. Brooke, who sat by on one
11460: occasion, suggested that Mr. Casaubon should go fishing, as Cadwallader
11461: did, and have a turning-room, make toys, table-legs, and that kind of
11462: thing.
11463: 
11464: “In short, you recommend me to anticipate the arrival of my second
11465: childhood,” said poor Mr. Casaubon, with some bitterness. “These
11466: things,” he added, looking at Lydgate, “would be to me such relaxation
11467: as tow-picking is to prisoners in a house of correction.”
11468: 
11469: “I confess,” said Lydgate, smiling, “amusement is rather an
11470: unsatisfactory prescription. It is something like telling people to
11471: keep up their spirits. Perhaps I had better say, that you must submit
11472: to be mildly bored rather than to go on working.”
11473: 
11474: “Yes, yes,” said Mr. Brooke. “Get Dorothea to play backgammon with you
11475: in the evenings. And shuttlecock, now—I don’t know a finer game than
11476: shuttlecock for the daytime. I remember it all the fashion. To be sure,
11477: your eyes might not stand that, Casaubon. But you must unbend, you
11478: know. Why, you might take to some light study: conchology, now: I
11479: always think that must be a light study. Or get Dorothea to read you
11480: light things, Smollett—‘Roderick Random,’ ‘Humphrey Clinker:’ they are
11481: a little broad, but she may read anything now she’s married, you know.
11482: I remember they made me laugh uncommonly—there’s a droll bit about a
11483: postilion’s breeches. We have no such humor now. I have gone through
11484: all these things, but they might be rather new to you.”
11485: 
11486: “As new as eating thistles,” would have been an answer to represent Mr.
11487: Casaubon’s feelings. But he only bowed resignedly, with due respect to
11488: his wife’s uncle, and observed that doubtless the works he mentioned
11489: had “served as a resource to a certain order of minds.”
11490: 
11491: “You see,” said the able magistrate to Lydgate, when they were outside
11492: the door, “Casaubon has been a little narrow: it leaves him rather at a
11493: loss when you forbid him his particular work, which I believe is
11494: something very deep indeed—in the line of research, you know. I would
11495: never give way to that; I was always versatile. But a clergyman is tied
11496: a little tight. If they would make him a bishop, now!—he did a very
11497: good pamphlet for Peel. He would have more movement then, more show; he
11498: might get a little flesh. But I recommend you to talk to Mrs. Casaubon.
11499: She is clever enough for anything, is my niece. Tell her, her husband
11500: wants liveliness, diversion: put her on amusing tactics.”
11501: 
11502: Without Mr. Brooke’s advice, Lydgate had determined on speaking to
11503: Dorothea. She had not been present while her uncle was throwing out his
11504: pleasant suggestions as to the mode in which life at Lowick might be
11505: enlivened, but she was usually by her husband’s side, and the
11506: unaffected signs of intense anxiety in her face and voice about
11507: whatever touched his mind or health, made a drama which Lydgate was
11508: inclined to watch. He said to himself that he was only doing right in
11509: telling her the truth about her husband’s probable future, but he
11510: certainly thought also that it would be interesting to talk
11511: confidentially with her. A medical man likes to make psychological
11512: observations, and sometimes in the pursuit of such studies is too
11513: easily tempted into momentous prophecy which life and death easily set
11514: at nought. Lydgate had often been satirical on this gratuitous
11515: prediction, and he meant now to be guarded.
11516: 
11517: He asked for Mrs. Casaubon, but being told that she was out walking, he
11518: was going away, when Dorothea and Celia appeared, both glowing from
11519: their struggle with the March wind. When Lydgate begged to speak with
11520: her alone, Dorothea opened the library door which happened to be the
11521: nearest, thinking of nothing at the moment but what he might have to
11522: say about Mr. Casaubon. It was the first time she had entered this room
11523: since her husband had been taken ill, and the servant had chosen not to
11524: open the shutters. But there was light enough to read by from the
11525: narrow upper panes of the windows.
11526: 
11527: “You will not mind this sombre light,” said Dorothea, standing in the
11528: middle of the room. “Since you forbade books, the library has been out
11529: of the question. But Mr. Casaubon will soon be here again, I hope. Is
11530: he not making progress?”
11531: 
11532: “Yes, much more rapid progress than I at first expected. Indeed, he is
11533: already nearly in his usual state of health.”
11534: 
11535: “You do not fear that the illness will return?” said Dorothea, whose
11536: quick ear had detected some significance in Lydgate’s tone.
11537: 
11538: “Such cases are peculiarly difficult to pronounce upon,” said Lydgate.
11539: “The only point on which I can be confident is that it will be
11540: desirable to be very watchful on Mr. Casaubon’s account, lest he should
11541: in any way strain his nervous power.”
11542: 
11543: “I beseech you to speak quite plainly,” said Dorothea, in an imploring
11544: tone. “I cannot bear to think that there might be something which I did
11545: not know, and which, if I had known it, would have made me act
11546: differently.” The words came out like a cry: it was evident that they
11547: were the voice of some mental experience which lay not very far off.
11548: 
11549: “Sit down,” she added, placing herself on the nearest chair, and
11550: throwing off her bonnet and gloves, with an instinctive discarding of
11551: formality where a great question of destiny was concerned.
11552: 
11553: “What you say now justifies my own view,” said Lydgate. “I think it is
11554: one’s function as a medical man to hinder regrets of that sort as far
11555: as possible. But I beg you to observe that Mr. Casaubon’s case is
11556: precisely of the kind in which the issue is most difficult to pronounce
11557: upon. He may possibly live for fifteen years or more, without much
11558: worse health than he has had hitherto.”
11559: 
11560: Dorothea had turned very pale, and when Lydgate paused she said in a
11561: low voice, “You mean if we are very careful.”
11562: 
11563: “Yes—careful against mental agitation of all kinds, and against
11564: excessive application.”
11565: 
11566: “He would be miserable, if he had to give up his work,” said Dorothea,
11567: with a quick prevision of that wretchedness.
11568: 
11569: “I am aware of that. The only course is to try by all means, direct and
11570: indirect, to moderate and vary his occupations. With a happy
11571: concurrence of circumstances, there is, as I said, no immediate danger
11572: from that affection of the heart, which I believe to have been the
11573: cause of his late attack. On the other hand, it is possible that the
11574: disease may develop itself more rapidly: it is one of those cases in
11575: which death is sometimes sudden. Nothing should be neglected which
11576: might be affected by such an issue.”
11577: 
11578: There was silence for a few moments, while Dorothea sat as if she had
11579: been turned to marble, though the life within her was so intense that
11580: her mind had never before swept in brief time over an equal range of
11581: scenes and motives.
11582: 
11583: “Help me, pray,” she said, at last, in the same low voice as before.
11584: “Tell me what I can do.”
11585: 
11586: “What do you think of foreign travel? You have been lately in Rome, I
11587: think.”
11588: 
11589: The memories which made this resource utterly hopeless were a new
11590: current that shook Dorothea out of her pallid immobility.
11591: 
11592: “Oh, that would not do—that would be worse than anything,” she said
11593: with a more childlike despondency, while the tears rolled down.
11594: “Nothing will be of any use that he does not enjoy.”
11595: 
11596: “I wish that I could have spared you this pain,” said Lydgate, deeply
11597: touched, yet wondering about her marriage. Women just like Dorothea had
11598: not entered into his traditions.
11599: 
11600: “It was right of you to tell me. I thank you for telling me the truth.”
11601: 
11602: “I wish you to understand that I shall not say anything to enlighten
11603: Mr. Casaubon himself. I think it desirable for him to know nothing more
11604: than that he must not overwork himself, and must observe certain rules.
11605: Anxiety of any kind would be precisely the most unfavorable condition
11606: for him.”
11607: 
11608: Lydgate rose, and Dorothea mechanically rose at the same time,
11609: unclasping her cloak and throwing it off as if it stifled her. He was
11610: bowing and quitting her, when an impulse which if she had been alone
11611: would have turned into a prayer, made her say with a sob in her voice—
11612: 
11613: “Oh, you are a wise man, are you not? You know all about life and
11614: death. Advise me. Think what I can do. He has been laboring all his
11615: life and looking forward. He minds about nothing else.— And I mind
11616: about nothing else—”
11617: 
11618: For years after Lydgate remembered the impression produced in him by
11619: this involuntary appeal—this cry from soul to soul, without other
11620: consciousness than their moving with kindred natures in the same
11621: embroiled medium, the same troublous fitfully illuminated life. But
11622: what could he say now except that he should see Mr. Casaubon again
11623: to-morrow?
11624: 
11625: When he was gone, Dorothea’s tears gushed forth, and relieved her
11626: stifling oppression. Then she dried her eyes, reminded that her
11627: distress must not be betrayed to her husband; and looked round the room
11628: thinking that she must order the servant to attend to it as usual,
11629: since Mr. Casaubon might now at any moment wish to enter. On his
11630: writing-table there were letters which had lain untouched since the
11631: morning when he was taken ill, and among them, as Dorothea well
11632: remembered, there were young Ladislaw’s letters, the one addressed to
11633: her still unopened. The associations of these letters had been made the
11634: more painful by that sudden attack of illness which she felt that the
11635: agitation caused by her anger might have helped to bring on: it would
11636: be time enough to read them when they were again thrust upon her, and
11637: she had had no inclination to fetch them from the library. But now it
11638: occurred to her that they should be put out of her husband’s sight:
11639: whatever might have been the sources of his annoyance about them, he
11640: must, if possible, not be annoyed again; and she ran her eyes first
11641: over the letter addressed to him to assure herself whether or not it
11642: would be necessary to write in order to hinder the offensive visit.
11643: 
11644: Will wrote from Rome, and began by saying that his obligations to Mr.
11645: Casaubon were too deep for all thanks not to seem impertinent. It was
11646: plain that if he were not grateful, he must be the poorest-spirited
11647: rascal who had ever found a generous friend. To expand in wordy thanks
11648: would be like saying, “I am honest.” But Will had come to perceive that
11649: his defects—defects which Mr. Casaubon had himself often pointed
11650: to—needed for their correction that more strenuous position which his
11651: relative’s generosity had hitherto prevented from being inevitable. He
11652: trusted that he should make the best return, if return were possible,
11653: by showing the effectiveness of the education for which he was
11654: indebted, and by ceasing in future to need any diversion towards
11655: himself of funds on which others might have a better claim. He was
11656: coming to England, to try his fortune, as many other young men were
11657: obliged to do whose only capital was in their brains. His friend
11658: Naumann had desired him to take charge of the “Dispute”—the picture
11659: painted for Mr. Casaubon, with whose permission, and Mrs. Casaubon’s,
11660: Will would convey it to Lowick in person. A letter addressed to the
11661: Poste Restante in Paris within the fortnight would hinder him, if
11662: necessary, from arriving at an inconvenient moment. He enclosed a
11663: letter to Mrs. Casaubon in which he continued a discussion about art,
11664: begun with her in Rome.
11665: 
11666: Opening her own letter Dorothea saw that it was a lively continuation
11667: of his remonstrance with her fanatical sympathy and her want of sturdy
11668: neutral delight in things as they were—an outpouring of his young
11669: vivacity which it was impossible to read just now. She had immediately
11670: to consider what was to be done about the other letter: there was still
11671: time perhaps to prevent Will from coming to Lowick. Dorothea ended by
11672: giving the letter to her uncle, who was still in the house, and begging
11673: him to let Will know that Mr. Casaubon had been ill, and that his
11674: health would not allow the reception of any visitors.
11675: 
11676: No one more ready than Mr. Brooke to write a letter: his only
11677: difficulty was to write a short one, and his ideas in this case
11678: expanded over the three large pages and the inward foldings. He had
11679: simply said to Dorothea—
11680: 
11681: “To be sure, I will write, my dear. He’s a very clever young
11682: fellow—this young Ladislaw—I dare say will be a rising young man. It’s
11683: a good letter—marks his sense of things, you know. However, I will tell
11684: him about Casaubon.”
11685: 
11686: But the end of Mr. Brooke’s pen was a thinking organ, evolving
11687: sentences, especially of a benevolent kind, before the rest of his mind
11688: could well overtake them. It expressed regrets and proposed remedies,
11689: which, when Mr. Brooke read them, seemed felicitously
11690: worded—surprisingly the right thing, and determined a sequel which he
11691: had never before thought of. In this case, his pen found it such a pity
11692: young Ladislaw should not have come into the neighborhood just at that
11693: time, in order that Mr. Brooke might make his acquaintance more fully,
11694: and that they might go over the long-neglected Italian drawings
11695: together—it also felt such an interest in a young man who was starting
11696: in life with a stock of ideas—that by the end of the second page it had
11697: persuaded Mr. Brooke to invite young Ladislaw, since he could not be
11698: received at Lowick, to come to Tipton Grange. Why not? They could find
11699: a great many things to do together, and this was a period of peculiar
11700: growth—the political horizon was expanding, and—in short, Mr. Brooke’s
11701: pen went off into a little speech which it had lately reported for that
11702: imperfectly edited organ the “Middlemarch Pioneer.” While Mr. Brooke
11703: was sealing this letter, he felt elated with an influx of dim
11704: projects:—a young man capable of putting ideas into form, the “Pioneer”
11705: purchased to clear the pathway for a new candidate, documents
11706: utilized—who knew what might come of it all? Since Celia was going to
11707: marry immediately, it would be very pleasant to have a young fellow at
11708: table with him, at least for a time.
11709: 
11710: But he went away without telling Dorothea what he had put into the
11711: letter, for she was engaged with her husband, and—in fact, these things
11712: were of no importance to her.
11713: 
11714: 
11715: 
11716: 
11717: CHAPTER XXXI.
11718: 
11719: How will you know the pitch of that great bell
11720: Too large for you to stir? Let but a flute
11721: Play ’neath the fine-mixed metal: listen close
11722: Till the right note flows forth, a silvery rill:
11723: Then shall the huge bell tremble—then the mass
11724: With myriad waves concurrent shall respond
11725: In low soft unison.
11726: 
11727: 
11728: Lydgate that evening spoke to Miss Vincy of Mrs. Casaubon, and laid
11729: some emphasis on the strong feeling she appeared to have for that
11730: formal studious man thirty years older than herself.
11731: 
11732: “Of course she is devoted to her husband,” said Rosamond, implying a
11733: notion of necessary sequence which the scientific man regarded as the
11734: prettiest possible for a woman; but she was thinking at the same time
11735: that it was not so very melancholy to be mistress of Lowick Manor with
11736: a husband likely to die soon. “Do you think her very handsome?”
11737: 
11738: “She certainly is handsome, but I have not thought about it,” said
11739: Lydgate.
11740: 
11741: “I suppose it would be unprofessional,” said Rosamond, dimpling. “But
11742: how your practice is spreading! You were called in before to the
11743: Chettams, I think; and now, the Casaubons.”
11744: 
11745: “Yes,” said Lydgate, in a tone of compulsory admission. “But I don’t
11746: really like attending such people so well as the poor. The cases are
11747: more monotonous, and one has to go through more fuss and listen more
11748: deferentially to nonsense.”
11749: 
11750: “Not more than in Middlemarch,” said Rosamond. “And at least you go
11751: through wide corridors and have the scent of rose-leaves everywhere.”
11752: 
11753: “That is true, Mademoiselle de Montmorenci,” said Lydgate, just bending
11754: his head to the table and lifting with his fourth finger her delicate
11755: handkerchief which lay at the mouth of her reticule, as if to enjoy its
11756: scent, while he looked at her with a smile.
11757: 
11758: But this agreeable holiday freedom with which Lydgate hovered about the
11759: flower of Middlemarch, could not continue indefinitely. It was not more
11760: possible to find social isolation in that town than elsewhere, and two
11761: people persistently flirting could by no means escape from “the various
11762: entanglements, weights, blows, clashings, motions, by which things
11763: severally go on.” Whatever Miss Vincy did must be remarked, and she was
11764: perhaps the more conspicuous to admirers and critics because just now
11765: Mrs. Vincy, after some struggle, had gone with Fred to stay a little
11766: while at Stone Court, there being no other way of at once gratifying
11767: old Featherstone and keeping watch against Mary Garth, who appeared a
11768: less tolerable daughter-in-law in proportion as Fred’s illness
11769: disappeared.
11770: 
11771: Aunt Bulstrode, for example, came a little oftener into Lowick Gate to
11772: see Rosamond, now she was alone. For Mrs. Bulstrode had a true sisterly
11773: feeling for her brother; always thinking that he might have married
11774: better, but wishing well to the children. Now Mrs. Bulstrode had a
11775: long-standing intimacy with Mrs. Plymdale. They had nearly the same
11776: preferences in silks, patterns for underclothing, china-ware, and
11777: clergymen; they confided their little troubles of health and household
11778: management to each other, and various little points of superiority on
11779: Mrs. Bulstrode’s side, namely, more decided seriousness, more
11780: admiration for mind, and a house outside the town, sometimes served to
11781: give color to their conversation without dividing them—well-meaning
11782: women both, knowing very little of their own motives.
11783: 
11784: Mrs. Bulstrode, paying a morning visit to Mrs. Plymdale, happened to
11785: say that she could not stay longer, because she was going to see poor
11786: Rosamond.
11787: 
11788: “Why do you say ‘poor Rosamond’?” said Mrs. Plymdale, a round-eyed
11789: sharp little woman, like a tamed falcon.
11790: 
11791: “She is so pretty, and has been brought up in such thoughtlessness. The
11792: mother, you know, had always that levity about her, which makes me
11793: anxious for the children.”
11794: 
11795: “Well, Harriet, if I am to speak my mind,” said Mrs. Plymdale, with
11796: emphasis, “I must say, anybody would suppose you and Mr. Bulstrode
11797: would be delighted with what has happened, for you have done everything
11798: to put Mr. Lydgate forward.”
11799: 
11800: “Selina, what do you mean?” said Mrs. Bulstrode, in genuine surprise.
11801: 
11802: “Not but what I am truly thankful for Ned’s sake,” said Mrs. Plymdale.
11803: “He could certainly better afford to keep such a wife than some people
11804: can; but I should wish him to look elsewhere. Still a mother has
11805: anxieties, and some young men would take to a bad life in consequence.
11806: Besides, if I was obliged to speak, I should say I was not fond of
11807: strangers coming into a town.”
11808: 
11809: “I don’t know, Selina,” said Mrs. Bulstrode, with a little emphasis in
11810: her turn. “Mr. Bulstrode was a stranger here at one time. Abraham and
11811: Moses were strangers in the land, and we are told to entertain
11812: strangers. And especially,” she added, after a slight pause, “when they
11813: are unexceptionable.”
11814: 
11815: “I was not speaking in a religious sense, Harriet. I spoke as a
11816: mother.”
11817: 
11818: “Selina, I am sure you have never heard me say anything against a niece
11819: of mine marrying your son.”
11820: 
11821: “Oh, it is pride in Miss Vincy—I am sure it is nothing else,” said Mrs.
11822: Plymdale, who had never before given all her confidence to “Harriet” on
11823: this subject. “No young man in Middlemarch was good enough for her: I
11824: have heard her mother say as much. That is not a Christian spirit, I
11825: think. But now, from all I hear, she has found a man as proud as
11826: herself.”
11827: 
11828: “You don’t mean that there is anything between Rosamond and Mr.
11829: Lydgate?” said Mrs. Bulstrode, rather mortified at finding out her own
11830: ignorance.
11831: 
11832: “Is it possible you don’t know, Harriet?”
11833: 
11834: “Oh, I go about so little; and I am not fond of gossip; I really never
11835: hear any. You see so many people that I don’t see. Your circle is
11836: rather different from ours.”
11837: 
11838: “Well, but your own niece and Mr. Bulstrode’s great favorite—and yours
11839: too, I am sure, Harriet! I thought, at one time, you meant him for
11840: Kate, when she is a little older.”
11841: 
11842: “I don’t believe there can be anything serious at present,” said Mrs.
11843: Bulstrode. “My brother would certainly have told me.”
11844: 
11845: “Well, people have different ways, but I understand that nobody can see
11846: Miss Vincy and Mr. Lydgate together without taking them to be engaged.
11847: However, it is not my business. Shall I put up the pattern of mittens?”
11848: 
11849: After this Mrs. Bulstrode drove to her niece with a mind newly
11850: weighted. She was herself handsomely dressed, but she noticed with a
11851: little more regret than usual that Rosamond, who was just come in and
11852: met her in walking-dress, was almost as expensively equipped. Mrs.
11853: Bulstrode was a feminine smaller edition of her brother, and had none
11854: of her husband’s low-toned pallor. She had a good honest glance and
11855: used no circumlocution.
11856: 
11857: “You are alone, I see, my dear,” she said, as they entered the
11858: drawing-room together, looking round gravely. Rosamond felt sure that
11859: her aunt had something particular to say, and they sat down near each
11860: other. Nevertheless, the quilling inside Rosamond’s bonnet was so
11861: charming that it was impossible not to desire the same kind of thing
11862: for Kate, and Mrs. Bulstrode’s eyes, which were rather fine, rolled
11863: round that ample quilled circuit, while she spoke.
11864: 
11865: “I have just heard something about you that has surprised me very much,
11866: Rosamond.”
11867: 
11868: “What is that, aunt?” Rosamond’s eyes also were roaming over her aunt’s
11869: large embroidered collar.
11870: 
11871: “I can hardly believe it—that you should be engaged without my knowing
11872: it—without your father’s telling me.” Here Mrs. Bulstrode’s eyes
11873: finally rested on Rosamond’s, who blushed deeply, and said—
11874: 
11875: “I am not engaged, aunt.”
11876: 
11877: “How is it that every one says so, then—that it is the town’s talk?”
11878: 
11879: “The town’s talk is of very little consequence, I think,” said
11880: Rosamond, inwardly gratified.
11881: 
11882: “Oh, my dear, be more thoughtful; don’t despise your neighbors so.
11883: Remember you are turned twenty-two now, and you will have no fortune:
11884: your father, I am sure, will not be able to spare you anything. Mr.
11885: Lydgate is very intellectual and clever; I know there is an attraction
11886: in that. I like talking to such men myself; and your uncle finds him
11887: very useful. But the profession is a poor one here. To be sure, this
11888: life is not everything; but it is seldom a medical man has true
11889: religious views—there is too much pride of intellect. And you are not
11890: fit to marry a poor man.
11891: 
11892: “Mr. Lydgate is not a poor man, aunt. He has very high connections.”
11893: 
11894: “He told me himself he was poor.”
11895: 
11896: “That is because he is used to people who have a high style of living.”
11897: 
11898: “My dear Rosamond, _you_ must not think of living in high style.”
11899: 
11900: Rosamond looked down and played with her reticule. She was not a fiery
11901: young lady and had no sharp answers, but she meant to live as she
11902: pleased.
11903: 
11904: “Then it is really true?” said Mrs. Bulstrode, looking very earnestly
11905: at her niece. “You are thinking of Mr. Lydgate—there is some
11906: understanding between you, though your father doesn’t know. Be open, my
11907: dear Rosamond: Mr. Lydgate has really made you an offer?”
11908: 
11909: Poor Rosamond’s feelings were very unpleasant. She had been quite easy
11910: as to Lydgate’s feeling and intention, but now when her aunt put this
11911: question she did not like being unable to say Yes. Her pride was hurt,
11912: but her habitual control of manner helped her.
11913: 
11914: “Pray excuse me, aunt. I would rather not speak on the subject.”
11915: 
11916: “You would not give your heart to a man without a decided prospect, I
11917: trust, my dear. And think of the two excellent offers I know of that
11918: you have refused!—and one still within your reach, if you will not
11919: throw it away. I knew a very great beauty who married badly at last, by
11920: doing so. Mr. Ned Plymdale is a nice young man—some might think
11921: good-looking; and an only son; and a large business of that kind is
11922: better than a profession. Not that marrying is everything. I would have
11923: you seek first the kingdom of God. But a girl should keep her heart
11924: within her own power.”
11925: 
11926: “I should never give it to Mr. Ned Plymdale, if it were. I have already
11927: refused him. If I loved, I should love at once and without change,”
11928: said Rosamond, with a great sense of being a romantic heroine, and
11929: playing the part prettily.
11930: 
11931: “I see how it is, my dear,” said Mrs. Bulstrode, in a melancholy voice,
11932: rising to go. “You have allowed your affections to be engaged without
11933: return.”
11934: 
11935: “No, indeed, aunt,” said Rosamond, with emphasis.
11936: 
11937: “Then you are quite confident that Mr. Lydgate has a serious attachment
11938: to you?”
11939: 
11940: Rosamond’s cheeks by this time were persistently burning, and she felt
11941: much mortification. She chose to be silent, and her aunt went away all
11942: the more convinced.
11943: 
11944: Mr. Bulstrode in things worldly and indifferent was disposed to do what
11945: his wife bade him, and she now, without telling her reasons, desired
11946: him on the next opportunity to find out in conversation with Mr.
11947: Lydgate whether he had any intention of marrying soon. The result was a
11948: decided negative. Mr. Bulstrode, on being cross-questioned, showed that
11949: Lydgate had spoken as no man would who had any attachment that could
11950: issue in matrimony. Mrs. Bulstrode now felt that she had a serious duty
11951: before her, and she soon managed to arrange a _tête-à-tête_ with
11952: Lydgate, in which she passed from inquiries about Fred Vincy’s health,
11953: and expressions of her sincere anxiety for her brother’s large family,
11954: to general remarks on the dangers which lay before young people with
11955: regard to their settlement in life. Young men were often wild and
11956: disappointing, making little return for the money spent on them, and a
11957: girl was exposed to many circumstances which might interfere with her
11958: prospects.
11959: 
11960: “Especially when she has great attractions, and her parents see much
11961: company,” said Mrs. Bulstrode. “Gentlemen pay her attention, and
11962: engross her all to themselves, for the mere pleasure of the moment, and
11963: that drives off others. I think it is a heavy responsibility, Mr.
11964: Lydgate, to interfere with the prospects of any girl.” Here Mrs.
11965: Bulstrode fixed her eyes on him, with an unmistakable purpose of
11966: warning, if not of rebuke.
11967: 
11968: “Clearly,” said Lydgate, looking at her—perhaps even staring a little
11969: in return. “On the other hand, a man must be a great coxcomb to go
11970: about with a notion that he must not pay attention to a young lady lest
11971: she should fall in love with him, or lest others should think she
11972: must.”
11973: 
11974: “Oh, Mr. Lydgate, you know well what your advantages are. You know that
11975: our young men here cannot cope with you. Where you frequent a house it
11976: may militate very much against a girl’s making a desirable settlement
11977: in life, and prevent her from accepting offers even if they are made.”
11978: 
11979: Lydgate was less flattered by his advantage over the Middlemarch
11980: Orlandos than he was annoyed by the perception of Mrs. Bulstrode’s
11981: meaning. She felt that she had spoken as impressively as it was
11982: necessary to do, and that in using the superior word “militate” she had
11983: thrown a noble drapery over a mass of particulars which were still
11984: evident enough.
11985: 
11986: Lydgate was fuming a little, pushed his hair back with one hand, felt
11987: curiously in his waistcoat-pocket with the other, and then stooped to
11988: beckon the tiny black spaniel, which had the insight to decline his
11989: hollow caresses. It would not have been decent to go away, because he
11990: had been dining with other guests, and had just taken tea. But Mrs.
11991: Bulstrode, having no doubt that she had been understood, turned the
11992: conversation.
11993: 
11994: Solomon’s Proverbs, I think, have omitted to say, that as the sore
11995: palate findeth grit, so an uneasy consciousness heareth innuendoes. The
11996: next day Mr. Farebrother, parting from Lydgate in the street, supposed
11997: that they should meet at Vincy’s in the evening. Lydgate answered
11998: curtly, no—he had work to do—he must give up going out in the evening.
11999: 
12000: “What! you are going to get lashed to the mast, eh, and are stopping
12001: your ears?” said the Vicar. “Well, if you don’t mean to be won by the
12002: sirens, you are right to take precautions in time.”
12003: 
12004: A few days before, Lydgate would have taken no notice of these words as
12005: anything more than the Vicar’s usual way of putting things. They seemed
12006: now to convey an innuendo which confirmed the impression that he had
12007: been making a fool of himself and behaving so as to be misunderstood:
12008: not, he believed, by Rosamond herself; she, he felt sure, took
12009: everything as lightly as he intended it. She had an exquisite tact and
12010: insight in relation to all points of manners; but the people she lived
12011: among were blunderers and busybodies. However, the mistake should go no
12012: farther. He resolved—and kept his resolution—that he would not go to
12013: Mr. Vincy’s except on business.
12014: 
12015: Rosamond became very unhappy. The uneasiness first stirred by her
12016: aunt’s questions grew and grew till at the end of ten days that she had
12017: not seen Lydgate, it grew into terror at the blank that might possibly
12018: come—into foreboding of that ready, fatal sponge which so cheaply wipes
12019: out the hopes of mortals. The world would have a new dreariness for
12020: her, as a wilderness that a magician’s spells had turned for a little
12021: while into a garden. She felt that she was beginning to know the pang
12022: of disappointed love, and that no other man could be the occasion of
12023: such delightful aerial building as she had been enjoying for the last
12024: six months. Poor Rosamond lost her appetite and felt as forlorn as
12025: Ariadne—as a charming stage Ariadne left behind with all her boxes full
12026: of costumes and no hope of a coach.
12027: 
12028: There are many wonderful mixtures in the world which are all alike
12029: called love, and claim the privileges of a sublime rage which is an
12030: apology for everything (in literature and the drama). Happily Rosamond
12031: did not think of committing any desperate act: she plaited her fair
12032: hair as beautifully as usual, and kept herself proudly calm. Her most
12033: cheerful supposition was that her aunt Bulstrode had interfered in some
12034: way to hinder Lydgate’s visits: everything was better than a
12035: spontaneous indifference in him. Any one who imagines ten days too
12036: short a time—not for falling into leanness, lightness, or other
12037: measurable effects of passion, but—for the whole spiritual circuit of
12038: alarmed conjecture and disappointment, is ignorant of what can go on in
12039: the elegant leisure of a young lady’s mind.
12040: 
12041: On the eleventh day, however, Lydgate when leaving Stone Court was
12042: requested by Mrs. Vincy to let her husband know that there was a marked
12043: change in Mr. Featherstone’s health, and that she wished him to come to
12044: Stone Court on that day. Now Lydgate might have called at the
12045: warehouse, or might have written a message on a leaf of his pocket-book
12046: and left it at the door. Yet these simple devices apparently did not
12047: occur to him, from which we may conclude that he had no strong
12048: objection to calling at the house at an hour when Mr. Vincy was not at
12049: home, and leaving the message with Miss Vincy. A man may, from various
12050: motives, decline to give his company, but perhaps not even a sage would
12051: be gratified that nobody missed him. It would be a graceful, easy way
12052: of piecing on the new habits to the old, to have a few playful words
12053: with Rosamond about his resistance to dissipation, and his firm resolve
12054: to take long fasts even from sweet sounds. It must be confessed, also,
12055: that momentary speculations as to all the possible grounds for Mrs.
12056: Bulstrode’s hints had managed to get woven like slight clinging hairs
12057: into the more substantial web of his thoughts.
12058: 
12059: Miss Vincy was alone, and blushed so deeply when Lydgate came in that
12060: he felt a corresponding embarrassment, and instead of any playfulness,
12061: he began at once to speak of his reason for calling, and to beg her,
12062: almost formally, to deliver the message to her father. Rosamond, who at
12063: the first moment felt as if her happiness were returning, was keenly
12064: hurt by Lydgate’s manner; her blush had departed, and she assented
12065: coldly, without adding an unnecessary word, some trivial chain-work
12066: which she had in her hands enabling her to avoid looking at Lydgate
12067: higher than his chin. In all failures, the beginning is certainly the
12068: half of the whole. After sitting two long moments while he moved his
12069: whip and could say nothing, Lydgate rose to go, and Rosamond, made
12070: nervous by her struggle between mortification and the wish not to
12071: betray it, dropped her chain as if startled, and rose too,
12072: mechanically. Lydgate instantaneously stooped to pick up the chain.
12073: When he rose he was very near to a lovely little face set on a fair
12074: long neck which he had been used to see turning about under the most
12075: perfect management of self-contented grace. But as he raised his eyes
12076: now he saw a certain helpless quivering which touched him quite newly,
12077: and made him look at Rosamond with a questioning flash. At this moment
12078: she was as natural as she had ever been when she was five years old:
12079: she felt that her tears had risen, and it was no use to try to do
12080: anything else than let them stay like water on a blue flower or let
12081: them fall over her cheeks, even as they would.
12082: 
12083: That moment of naturalness was the crystallizing feather-touch: it
12084: shook flirtation into love. Remember that the ambitious man who was
12085: looking at those Forget-me-nots under the water was very warm-hearted
12086: and rash. He did not know where the chain went; an idea had thrilled
12087: through the recesses within him which had a miraculous effect in
12088: raising the power of passionate love lying buried there in no sealed
12089: sepulchre, but under the lightest, easily pierced mould. His words were
12090: quite abrupt and awkward; but the tone made them sound like an ardent,
12091: appealing avowal.
12092: 
12093: “What is the matter? you are distressed. Tell me, pray.”
12094: 
12095: Rosamond had never been spoken to in such tones before. I am not sure
12096: that she knew what the words were: but she looked at Lydgate and the
12097: tears fell over her cheeks. There could have been no more complete
12098: answer than that silence, and Lydgate, forgetting everything else,
12099: completely mastered by the outrush of tenderness at the sudden belief
12100: that this sweet young creature depended on him for her joy, actually
12101: put his arms round her, folding her gently and protectingly—he was used
12102: to being gentle with the weak and suffering—and kissed each of the two
12103: large tears. This was a strange way of arriving at an understanding,
12104: but it was a short way. Rosamond was not angry, but she moved backward
12105: a little in timid happiness, and Lydgate could now sit near her and
12106: speak less incompletely. Rosamond had to make her little confession,
12107: and he poured out words of gratitude and tenderness with impulsive
12108: lavishment. In half an hour he left the house an engaged man, whose
12109: soul was not his own, but the woman’s to whom he had bound himself.
12110: 
12111: He came again in the evening to speak with Mr. Vincy, who, just
12112: returned from Stone Court, was feeling sure that it would not be long
12113: before he heard of Mr. Featherstone’s demise. The felicitous word
12114: “demise,” which had seasonably occurred to him, had raised his spirits
12115: even above their usual evening pitch. The right word is always a power,
12116: and communicates its definiteness to our action. Considered as a
12117: demise, old Featherstone’s death assumed a merely legal aspect, so that
12118: Mr. Vincy could tap his snuff-box over it and be jovial, without even
12119: an intermittent affectation of solemnity; and Mr. Vincy hated both
12120: solemnity and affectation. Who was ever awe struck about a testator, or
12121: sang a hymn on the title to real property? Mr. Vincy was inclined to
12122: take a jovial view of all things that evening: he even observed to
12123: Lydgate that Fred had got the family constitution after all, and would
12124: soon be as fine a fellow as ever again; and when his approbation of
12125: Rosamond’s engagement was asked for, he gave it with astonishing
12126: facility, passing at once to general remarks on the desirableness of
12127: matrimony for young men and maidens, and apparently deducing from the
12128: whole the appropriateness of a little more punch.

12133: CHAPTER XXXII.
12134: 
12135: They’ll take suggestion as a cat laps milk.
12136: —SHAKESPEARE: _Tempest_.
12137: 
12138: 
12139: The triumphant confidence of the Mayor founded on Mr. Featherstone’s
12140: insistent demand that Fred and his mother should not leave him, was a
12141: feeble emotion compared with all that was agitating the breasts of the
12142: old man’s blood-relations, who naturally manifested more their sense of
12143: the family tie and were more visibly numerous now that he had become
12144: bedridden. Naturally: for when “poor Peter” had occupied his arm-chair
12145: in the wainscoted parlor, no assiduous beetles for whom the cook
12146: prepares boiling water could have been less welcome on a hearth which
12147: they had reasons for preferring, than those persons whose Featherstone
12148: blood was ill-nourished, not from penuriousness on their part, but from
12149: poverty. Brother Solomon and Sister Jane were rich, and the family
12150: candor and total abstinence from false politeness with which they were
12151: always received seemed to them no argument that their brother in the
12152: solemn act of making his will would overlook the superior claims of
12153: wealth. Themselves at least he had never been unnatural enough to
12154: banish from his house, and it seemed hardly eccentric that he should
12155: have kept away Brother Jonah, Sister Martha, and the rest, who had no
12156: shadow of such claims. They knew Peter’s maxim, that money was a good
12157: egg, and should be laid in a warm nest.
12158: 
12159: But Brother Jonah, Sister Martha, and all the needy exiles, held a
12160: different point of view. Probabilities are as various as the faces to
12161: be seen at will in fretwork or paper-hangings: every form is there,
12162: from Jupiter to Judy, if you only look with creative inclination. To
12163: the poorer and least favored it seemed likely that since Peter had done
12164: nothing for them in his life, he would remember them at the last. Jonah
12165: argued that men liked to make a surprise of their wills, while Martha
12166: said that nobody need be surprised if he left the best part of his
12167: money to those who least expected it. Also it was not to be thought but
12168: that an own brother “lying there” with dropsy in his legs must come to
12169: feel that blood was thicker than water, and if he didn’t alter his
12170: will, he might have money by him. At any rate some blood-relations
12171: should be on the premises and on the watch against those who were
12172: hardly relations at all. Such things had been known as forged wills and
12173: disputed wills, which seemed to have the golden-hazy advantage of
12174: somehow enabling non-legatees to live out of them. Again, those who
12175: were no blood-relations might be caught making away with things—and
12176: poor Peter “lying there” helpless! Somebody should be on the watch. But
12177: in this conclusion they were at one with Solomon and Jane; also, some
12178: nephews, nieces, and cousins, arguing with still greater subtilty as to
12179: what might be done by a man able to “will away” his property and give
12180: himself large treats of oddity, felt in a handsome sort of way that
12181: there was a family interest to be attended to, and thought of Stone
12182: Court as a place which it would be nothing but right for them to visit.
12183: Sister Martha, otherwise Mrs. Cranch, living with some wheeziness in
12184: the Chalky Flats, could not undertake the journey; but her son, as
12185: being poor Peter’s own nephew, could represent her advantageously, and
12186: watch lest his uncle Jonah should make an unfair use of the improbable
12187: things which seemed likely to happen. In fact there was a general sense
12188: running in the Featherstone blood that everybody must watch everybody
12189: else, and that it would be well for everybody else to reflect that the
12190: Almighty was watching him.
12191: 
12192: Thus Stone Court continually saw one or other blood-relation alighting
12193: or departing, and Mary Garth had the unpleasant task of carrying their
12194: messages to Mr. Featherstone, who would see none of them, and sent her
12195: down with the still more unpleasant task of telling them so. As manager
12196: of the household she felt bound to ask them in good provincial fashion
12197: to stay and eat; but she chose to consult Mrs. Vincy on the point of
12198: extra down-stairs consumption now that Mr. Featherstone was laid up.
12199: 
12200: “Oh, my dear, you must do things handsomely where there’s last illness
12201: and a property. God knows, I don’t grudge them every ham in the
12202: house—only, save the best for the funeral. Have some stuffed veal
12203: always, and a fine cheese in cut. You must expect to keep open house in
12204: these last illnesses,” said liberal Mrs. Vincy, once more of cheerful
12205: note and bright plumage.
12206: 
12207: But some of the visitors alighted and did not depart after the handsome
12208: treating to veal and ham. Brother Jonah, for example (there are such
12209: unpleasant people in most families; perhaps even in the highest
12210: aristocracy there are Brobdingnag specimens, gigantically in debt and
12211: bloated at greater expense)—Brother Jonah, I say, having come down in
12212: the world, was mainly supported by a calling which he was modest enough
12213: not to boast of, though it was much better than swindling either on
12214: exchange or turf, but which did not require his presence at Brassing so
12215: long as he had a good corner to sit in and a supply of food. He chose
12216: the kitchen-corner, partly because he liked it best, and partly because
12217: he did not want to sit with Solomon, concerning whom he had a strong
12218: brotherly opinion. Seated in a famous arm-chair and in his best suit,
12219: constantly within sight of good cheer, he had a comfortable
12220: consciousness of being on the premises, mingled with fleeting
12221: suggestions of Sunday and the bar at the Green Man; and he informed
12222: Mary Garth that he should not go out of reach of his brother Peter
12223: while that poor fellow was above ground. The troublesome ones in a
12224: family are usually either the wits or the idiots. Jonah was the wit
12225: among the Featherstones, and joked with the maid-servants when they
12226: came about the hearth, but seemed to consider Miss Garth a suspicious
12227: character, and followed her with cold eyes.
12228: 
12229: Mary would have borne this one pair of eyes with comparative ease, but
12230: unfortunately there was young Cranch, who, having come all the way from
12231: the Chalky Flats to represent his mother and watch his uncle Jonah,
12232: also felt it his duty to stay and to sit chiefly in the kitchen to give
12233: his uncle company. Young Cranch was not exactly the balancing point
12234: between the wit and the idiot,—verging slightly towards the latter
12235: type, and squinting so as to leave everything in doubt about his
12236: sentiments except that they were not of a forcible character. When Mary
12237: Garth entered the kitchen and Mr. Jonah Featherstone began to follow
12238: her with his cold detective eyes, young Cranch turning his head in the
12239: same direction seemed to insist on it that she should remark how he was
12240: squinting, as if he did it with design, like the gypsies when Borrow
12241: read the New Testament to them. This was rather too much for poor Mary;
12242: sometimes it made her bilious, sometimes it upset her gravity. One day
12243: that she had an opportunity she could not resist describing the kitchen
12244: scene to Fred, who would not be hindered from immediately going to see
12245: it, affecting simply to pass through. But no sooner did he face the
12246: four eyes than he had to rush through the nearest door which happened
12247: to lead to the dairy, and there under the high roof and among the pans
12248: he gave way to laughter which made a hollow resonance perfectly audible
12249: in the kitchen. He fled by another doorway, but Mr. Jonah, who had not
12250: before seen Fred’s white complexion, long legs, and pinched delicacy of
12251: face, prepared many sarcasms in which these points of appearance were
12252: wittily combined with the lowest moral attributes.
12253: 
12254: “Why, Tom, _you_ don’t wear such gentlemanly trousers—you haven’t got
12255: half such fine long legs,” said Jonah to his nephew, winking at the
12256: same time, to imply that there was something more in these statements
12257: than their undeniableness. Tom looked at his legs, but left it
12258: uncertain whether he preferred his moral advantages to a more vicious
12259: length of limb and reprehensible gentility of trouser.
12260: 
12261: In the large wainscoted parlor too there were constantly pairs of eyes
12262: on the watch, and own relatives eager to be “sitters-up.” Many came,
12263: lunched, and departed, but Brother Solomon and the lady who had been
12264: Jane Featherstone for twenty-five years before she was Mrs. Waule found
12265: it good to be there every day for hours, without other calculable
12266: occupation than that of observing the cunning Mary Garth (who was so
12267: deep that she could be found out in nothing) and giving occasional dry
12268: wrinkly indications of crying—as if capable of torrents in a wetter
12269: season—at the thought that they were not allowed to go into Mr.
12270: Featherstone’s room. For the old man’s dislike of his own family seemed
12271: to get stronger as he got less able to amuse himself by saying biting
12272: things to them. Too languid to sting, he had the more venom refluent in
12273: his blood.
12274: 
12275: Not fully believing the message sent through Mary Garth, they had
12276: presented themselves together within the door of the bedroom, both in
12277: black—Mrs. Waule having a white handkerchief partially unfolded in her
12278: hand—and both with faces in a sort of half-mourning purple; while Mrs.
12279: Vincy with her pink cheeks and pink ribbons flying was actually
12280: administering a cordial to their own brother, and the
12281: light-complexioned Fred, his short hair curling as might be expected in
12282: a gambler’s, was lolling at his ease in a large chair.
12283: 
12284: Old Featherstone no sooner caught sight of these funereal figures
12285: appearing in spite of his orders than rage came to strengthen him more
12286: successfully than the cordial. He was propped up on a bed-rest, and
12287: always had his gold-headed stick lying by him. He seized it now and
12288: swept it backwards and forwards in as large an area as he could,
12289: apparently to ban these ugly spectres, crying in a hoarse sort of
12290: screech—
12291: 
12292: “Back, back, Mrs. Waule! Back, Solomon!”
12293: 
12294: “Oh, Brother. Peter,” Mrs. Waule began—but Solomon put his hand before
12295: her repressingly. He was a large-cheeked man, nearly seventy, with
12296: small furtive eyes, and was not only of much blander temper but thought
12297: himself much deeper than his brother Peter; indeed not likely to be
12298: deceived in any of his fellow-men, inasmuch as they could not well be
12299: more greedy and deceitful than he suspected them of being. Even the
12300: invisible powers, he thought, were likely to be soothed by a bland
12301: parenthesis here and there—coming from a man of property, who might
12302: have been as impious as others.
12303: 
12304: “Brother Peter,” he said, in a wheedling yet gravely official tone,
12305: “It’s nothing but right I should speak to you about the Three Crofts
12306: and the Manganese. The Almighty knows what I’ve got on my mind—”
12307: 
12308: “Then he knows more than I want to know,” said Peter, laying down his
12309: stick with a show of truce which had a threat in it too, for he
12310: reversed the stick so as to make the gold handle a club in case of
12311: closer fighting, and looked hard at Solomon’s bald head.
12312: 
12313: “There’s things you might repent of, Brother, for want of speaking to
12314: me,” said Solomon, not advancing, however. “I could sit up with you
12315: to-night, and Jane with me, willingly, and you might take your own time
12316: to speak, or let me speak.”
12317: 
12318: “Yes, I shall take my own time—you needn’t offer me yours,” said Peter.
12319: 
12320: “But you can’t take your own time to die in, Brother,” began Mrs.
12321: Waule, with her usual woolly tone. “And when you lie speechless you may
12322: be tired of having strangers about you, and you may think of me and my
12323: children”—but here her voice broke under the touching thought which she
12324: was attributing to her speechless brother; the mention of ourselves
12325: being naturally affecting.
12326: 
12327: “No, I shan’t,” said old Featherstone, contradictiously. “I shan’t
12328: think of any of you. I’ve made my will, I tell you, I’ve made my will.”
12329: Here he turned his head towards Mrs. Vincy, and swallowed some more of
12330: his cordial.
12331: 
12332: “Some people would be ashamed to fill up a place belonging by rights to
12333: others,” said Mrs. Waule, turning her narrow eyes in the same
12334: direction.
12335: 
12336: “Oh, sister,” said Solomon, with ironical softness, “you and me are not
12337: fine, and handsome, and clever enough: we must be humble and let smart
12338: people push themselves before us.”
12339: 
12340: Fred’s spirit could not bear this: rising and looking at Mr.
12341: Featherstone, he said, “Shall my mother and I leave the room, sir, that
12342: you may be alone with your friends?”
12343: 
12344: “Sit down, I tell you,” said old Featherstone, snappishly. “Stop where
12345: you are. Good-by, Solomon,” he added, trying to wield his stick again,
12346: but failing now that he had reversed the handle. “Good-by, Mrs. Waule.
12347: Don’t you come again.”
12348: 
12349: “I shall be down-stairs, Brother, whether or no,” said Solomon. “I
12350: shall do my duty, and it remains to be seen what the Almighty will
12351: allow.”
12352: 
12353: “Yes, in property going out of families,” said Mrs. Waule, in
12354: continuation,—“and where there’s steady young men to carry on. But I
12355: pity them who are not such, and I pity their mothers. Good-by, Brother
12356: Peter.”
12357: 
12358: “Remember, I’m the eldest after you, Brother, and prospered from the
12359: first, just as you did, and have got land already by the name of
12360: Featherstone,” said Solomon, relying much on that reflection, as one
12361: which might be suggested in the watches of the night. “But I bid you
12362: good-by for the present.”
12363: 
12364: Their exit was hastened by their seeing old Mr. Featherstone pull his
12365: wig on each side and shut his eyes with his mouth-widening grimace, as
12366: if he were determined to be deaf and blind.
12367: 
12368: None the less they came to Stone Court daily and sat below at the post
12369: of duty, sometimes carrying on a slow dialogue in an undertone in which
12370: the observation and response were so far apart, that any one hearing
12371: them might have imagined himself listening to speaking automata, in
12372: some doubt whether the ingenious mechanism would really work, or wind
12373: itself up for a long time in order to stick and be silent. Solomon and
12374: Jane would have been sorry to be quick: what that led to might be seen
12375: on the other side of the wall in the person of Brother Jonah.
12376: 
12377: But their watch in the wainscoted parlor was sometimes varied by the
12378: presence of other guests from far or near. Now that Peter Featherstone
12379: was up-stairs, his property could be discussed with all that local
12380: enlightenment to be found on the spot: some rural and Middlemarch
12381: neighbors expressed much agreement with the family and sympathy with
12382: their interest against the Vincys, and feminine visitors were even
12383: moved to tears, in conversation with Mrs. Waule, when they recalled the
12384: fact that they themselves had been disappointed in times past by
12385: codicils and marriages for spite on the part of ungrateful elderly
12386: gentlemen, who, it might have been supposed, had been spared for
12387: something better. Such conversation paused suddenly, like an organ when
12388: the bellows are let drop, if Mary Garth came into the room; and all
12389: eyes were turned on her as a possible legatee, or one who might get
12390: access to iron chests.
12391: 
12392: But the younger men who were relatives or connections of the family,
12393: were disposed to admire her in this problematic light, as a girl who
12394: showed much conduct, and who among all the chances that were flying
12395: might turn out to be at least a moderate prize. Hence she had her share
12396: of compliments and polite attentions.
12397: 
12398: Especially from Mr. Borthrop Trumbull, a distinguished bachelor and
12399: auctioneer of those parts, much concerned in the sale of land and
12400: cattle: a public character, indeed, whose name was seen on widely
12401: distributed placards, and who might reasonably be sorry for those who
12402: did not know of him. He was second cousin to Peter Featherstone, and
12403: had been treated by him with more amenity than any other relative,
12404: being useful in matters of business; and in that programme of his
12405: funeral which the old man had himself dictated, he had been named as a
12406: Bearer. There was no odious cupidity in Mr. Borthrop Trumbull—nothing
12407: more than a sincere sense of his own merit, which, he was aware, in
12408: case of rivalry might tell against competitors; so that if Peter
12409: Featherstone, who so far as he, Trumbull, was concerned, had behaved
12410: like as good a soul as ever breathed, should have done anything
12411: handsome by him, all he could say was, that he had never fished and
12412: fawned, but had advised him to the best of his experience, which now
12413: extended over twenty years from the time of his apprenticeship at
12414: fifteen, and was likely to yield a knowledge of no surreptitious kind.
12415: His admiration was far from being confined to himself, but was
12416: accustomed professionally as well as privately to delight in estimating
12417: things at a high rate. He was an amateur of superior phrases, and never
12418: used poor language without immediately correcting himself—which was
12419: fortunate, as he was rather loud, and given to predominate, standing or
12420: walking about frequently, pulling down his waistcoat with the air of a
12421: man who is very much of his own opinion, trimming himself rapidly with
12422: his fore-finger, and marking each new series in these movements by a
12423: busy play with his large seals. There was occasionally a little
12424: fierceness in his demeanor, but it was directed chiefly against false
12425: opinion, of which there is so much to correct in the world that a man
12426: of some reading and experience necessarily has his patience tried. He
12427: felt that the Featherstone family generally was of limited
12428: understanding, but being a man of the world and a public character,
12429: took everything as a matter of course, and even went to converse with
12430: Mr. Jonah and young Cranch in the kitchen, not doubting that he had
12431: impressed the latter greatly by his leading questions concerning the
12432: Chalky Flats. If anybody had observed that Mr. Borthrop Trumbull, being
12433: an auctioneer, was bound to know the nature of everything, he would
12434: have smiled and trimmed himself silently with the sense that he came
12435: pretty near that. On the whole, in an auctioneering way, he was an
12436: honorable man, not ashamed of his business, and feeling that “the
12437: celebrated Peel, now Sir Robert,” if introduced to him, would not fail
12438: to recognize his importance.
12439: 
12440: “I don’t mind if I have a slice of that ham, and a glass of that ale,
12441: Miss Garth, if you will allow me,” he said, coming into the parlor at
12442: half-past eleven, after having had the exceptional privilege of seeing
12443: old Featherstone, and standing with his back to the fire between Mrs.
12444: Waule and Solomon.
12445: 
12446: “It’s not necessary for you to go out;—let me ring the bell.”
12447: 
12448: “Thank you,” said Mary, “I have an errand.”
12449: 
12450: “Well, Mr. Trumbull, you’re highly favored,” said Mrs. Waule.
12451: 
12452: “What! seeing the old man?” said the auctioneer, playing with his seals
12453: dispassionately. “Ah, you see he has relied on me considerably.” Here
12454: he pressed his lips together, and frowned meditatively.
12455: 
12456: “Might anybody ask what their brother has been saying?” said Solomon,
12457: in a soft tone of humility, in which he had a sense of luxurious
12458: cunning, he being a rich man and not in need of it.
12459: 
12460: “Oh yes, anybody may ask,” said Mr. Trumbull, with loud and
12461: good-humored though cutting sarcasm. “Anybody may interrogate. Any one
12462: may give their remarks an interrogative turn,” he continued, his
12463: sonorousness rising with his style. “This is constantly done by good
12464: speakers, even when they anticipate no answer. It is what we call a
12465: figure of speech—speech at a high figure, as one may say.” The eloquent
12466: auctioneer smiled at his own ingenuity.
12467: 
12468: “I shouldn’t be sorry to hear he’d remembered you, Mr. Trumbull,” said
12469: Solomon. “I never was against the deserving. It’s the undeserving I’m
12470: against.”
12471: 
12472: “Ah, there it is, you see, there it is,” said Mr. Trumbull,
12473: significantly. “It can’t be denied that undeserving people have been
12474: legatees, and even residuary legatees. It is so, with testamentary
12475: dispositions.” Again he pursed up his lips and frowned a little.
12476: 
12477: “Do you mean to say for certain, Mr. Trumbull, that my brother has left
12478: his land away from our family?” said Mrs. Waule, on whom, as an
12479: unhopeful woman, those long words had a depressing effect.
12480: 
12481: “A man might as well turn his land into charity land at once as leave
12482: it to some people,” observed Solomon, his sister’s question having
12483: drawn no answer.
12484: 
12485: “What, Blue-Coat land?” said Mrs. Waule, again. “Oh, Mr. Trumbull, you
12486: never can mean to say that. It would be flying in the face of the
12487: Almighty that’s prospered him.”
12488: 
12489: While Mrs. Waule was speaking, Mr. Borthrop Trumbull walked away from
12490: the fireplace towards the window, patrolling with his fore-finger round
12491: the inside of his stock, then along his whiskers and the curves of his
12492: hair. He now walked to Miss Garth’s work-table, opened a book which lay
12493: there and read the title aloud with pompous emphasis as if he were
12494: offering it for sale:
12495: 
12496: “‘Anne of Geierstein’ (pronounced Jeersteen) or the ‘Maiden of the
12497: Mist, by the author of Waverley.’” Then turning the page, he began
12498: sonorously—“The course of four centuries has well-nigh elapsed since
12499: the series of events which are related in the following chapters took
12500: place on the Continent.” He pronounced the last truly admirable word
12501: with the accent on the last syllable, not as unaware of vulgar usage,
12502: but feeling that this novel delivery enhanced the sonorous beauty which
12503: his reading had given to the whole.
12504: 
12505: And now the servant came in with the tray, so that the moments for
12506: answering Mrs. Waule’s question had gone by safely, while she and
12507: Solomon, watching Mr. Trumbull’s movements, were thinking that high
12508: learning interfered sadly with serious affairs. Mr. Borthrop Trumbull
12509: really knew nothing about old Featherstone’s will; but he could hardly
12510: have been brought to declare any ignorance unless he had been arrested
12511: for misprision of treason.
12512: 
12513: “I shall take a mere mouthful of ham and a glass of ale,” he said,
12514: reassuringly. “As a man with public business, I take a snack when I
12515: can. I will back this ham,” he added, after swallowing some morsels
12516: with alarming haste, “against any ham in the three kingdoms. In my
12517: opinion it is better than the hams at Freshitt Hall—and I think I am a
12518: tolerable judge.”
12519: 
12520: “Some don’t like so much sugar in their hams,” said Mrs. Waule. “But my
12521: poor brother would always have sugar.”
12522: 
12523: “If any person demands better, he is at liberty to do so; but, God
12524: bless me, what an aroma! I should be glad to buy in that quality, I
12525: know. There is some gratification to a gentleman”—here Mr. Trumbull’s
12526: voice conveyed an emotional remonstrance—“in having this kind of ham
12527: set on his table.”
12528: 
12529: He pushed aside his plate, poured out his glass of ale and drew his
12530: chair a little forward, profiting by the occasion to look at the inner
12531: side of his legs, which he stroked approvingly—Mr. Trumbull having all
12532: those less frivolous airs and gestures which distinguish the
12533: predominant races of the north.
12534: 
12535: “You have an interesting work there, I see, Miss Garth,” he observed,
12536: when Mary re-entered. “It is by the author of ‘Waverley’: that is Sir
12537: Walter Scott. I have bought one of his works myself—a very nice thing,
12538: a very superior publication, entitled ‘Ivanhoe.’ You will not get any
12539: writer to beat him in a hurry, I think—he will not, in my opinion, be
12540: speedily surpassed. I have just been reading a portion at the
12541: commencement of ‘Anne of Jeersteen.’ It commences well.” (Things never
12542: began with Mr. Borthrop Trumbull: they always commenced, both in
12543: private life and on his handbills.) “You are a reader, I see. Do you
12544: subscribe to our Middlemarch library?”
12545: 
12546: “No,” said Mary. “Mr. Fred Vincy brought this book.”
12547: 
12548: “I am a great bookman myself,” returned Mr. Trumbull. “I have no less
12549: than two hundred volumes in calf, and I flatter myself they are well
12550: selected. Also pictures by Murillo, Rubens, Teniers, Titian, Vandyck,
12551: and others. I shall be happy to lend you any work you like to mention,
12552: Miss Garth.”
12553: 
12554: “I am much obliged,” said Mary, hastening away again, “but I have
12555: little time for reading.”
12556: 
12557: “I should say my brother has done something for _her_ in his will,”
12558: said Mr. Solomon, in a very low undertone, when she had shut the door
12559: behind her, pointing with his head towards the absent Mary.
12560: 
12561: “His first wife was a poor match for him, though,” said Mrs. Waule.
12562: “She brought him nothing: and this young woman is only her niece,—and
12563: very proud. And my brother has always paid her wage.”
12564: 
12565: “A sensible girl though, in my opinion,” said Mr. Trumbull, finishing
12566: his ale and starting up with an emphatic adjustment of his waistcoat.
12567: “I have observed her when she has been mixing medicine in drops. She
12568: minds what she is doing, sir. That is a great point in a woman, and a
12569: great point for our friend up-stairs, poor dear old soul. A man whose
12570: life is of any value should think of his wife as a nurse: that is what
12571: I should do, if I married; and I believe I have lived single long
12572: enough not to make a mistake in that line. Some men must marry to
12573: elevate themselves a little, but when I am in need of that, I hope some
12574: one will tell me so—I hope some individual will apprise me of the fact.
12575: I wish you good morning, Mrs. Waule. Good morning, Mr. Solomon. I trust
12576: we shall meet under less melancholy auspices.”
12577: 
12578: When Mr. Trumbull had departed with a fine bow, Solomon, leaning
12579: forward, observed to his sister, “You may depend, Jane, my brother has
12580: left that girl a lumping sum.”
12581: 
12582: “Anybody would think so, from the way Mr. Trumbull talks,” said Jane.
12583: Then, after a pause, “He talks as if my daughters wasn’t to be trusted
12584: to give drops.”
12585: 
12586: “Auctioneers talk wild,” said Solomon. “Not but what Trumbull has made
12587: money.”
12588: 
12589: 
12590: 
12591: 
12592: CHAPTER XXXIII.
12593: 
12594: “Close up his eyes and draw the curtain close;
12595: And let us all to meditation.”
12596: —2 _Henry VI_.
12597: 
12598: 
12599: That night after twelve o’clock Mary Garth relieved the watch in Mr.
12600: Featherstone’s room, and sat there alone through the small hours. She
12601: often chose this task, in which she found some pleasure,
12602: notwithstanding the old man’s testiness whenever he demanded her
12603: attentions. There were intervals in which she could sit perfectly
12604: still, enjoying the outer stillness and the subdued light. The red fire
12605: with its gently audible movement seemed like a solemn existence calmly
12606: independent of the petty passions, the imbecile desires, the straining
12607: after worthless uncertainties, which were daily moving her contempt.
12608: Mary was fond of her own thoughts, and could amuse herself well sitting
12609: in twilight with her hands in her lap; for, having early had strong
12610: reason to believe that things were not likely to be arranged for her
12611: peculiar satisfaction, she wasted no time in astonishment and annoyance
12612: at that fact. And she had already come to take life very much as a
12613: comedy in which she had a proud, nay, a generous resolution not to act
12614: the mean or treacherous part. Mary might have become cynical if she had
12615: not had parents whom she honored, and a well of affectionate gratitude
12616: within her, which was all the fuller because she had learned to make no
12617: unreasonable claims.
12618: 
12619: She sat to-night revolving, as she was wont, the scenes of the day, her
12620: lips often curling with amusement at the oddities to which her fancy
12621: added fresh drollery: people were so ridiculous with their illusions,
12622: carrying their fool’s caps unawares, thinking their own lies opaque
12623: while everybody else’s were transparent, making themselves exceptions
12624: to everything, as if when all the world looked yellow under a lamp they
12625: alone were rosy. Yet there were some illusions under Mary’s eyes which
12626: were not quite comic to her. She was secretly convinced, though she had
12627: no other grounds than her close observation of old Featherstone’s
12628: nature, that in spite of his fondness for having the Vincys about him,
12629: they were as likely to be disappointed as any of the relations whom he
12630: kept at a distance. She had a good deal of disdain for Mrs. Vincy’s
12631: evident alarm lest she and Fred should be alone together, but it did
12632: not hinder her from thinking anxiously of the way in which Fred would
12633: be affected, if it should turn out that his uncle had left him as poor
12634: as ever. She could make a butt of Fred when he was present, but she did
12635: not enjoy his follies when he was absent.
12636: 
12637: Yet she liked her thoughts: a vigorous young mind not overbalanced by
12638: passion, finds a good in making acquaintance with life, and watches its
12639: own powers with interest. Mary had plenty of merriment within.
12640: 
12641: Her thought was not veined by any solemnity or pathos about the old man
12642: on the bed: such sentiments are easier to affect than to feel about an
12643: aged creature whose life is not visibly anything but a remnant of
12644: vices. She had always seen the most disagreeable side of Mr.
12645: Featherstone: he was not proud of her, and she was only useful to him.
12646: To be anxious about a soul that is always snapping at you must be left
12647: to the saints of the earth; and Mary was not one of them. She had never
12648: returned him a harsh word, and had waited on him faithfully: that was
12649: her utmost. Old Featherstone himself was not in the least anxious about
12650: his soul, and had declined to see Mr. Tucker on the subject.
12651: 
12652: To-night he had not snapped, and for the first hour or two he lay
12653: remarkably still, until at last Mary heard him rattling his bunch of
12654: keys against the tin box which he always kept in the bed beside him.
12655: About three o’clock he said, with remarkable distinctness, “Missy, come
12656: here!”
12657: 
12658: Mary obeyed, and found that he had already drawn the tin box from under
12659: the clothes, though he usually asked to have this done for him; and he
12660: had selected the key. He now unlocked the box, and, drawing from it
12661: another key, looked straight at her with eyes that seemed to have
12662: recovered all their sharpness and said, “How many of ’em are in the
12663: house?”
12664: 
12665: “You mean of your own relations, sir,” said Mary, well used to the old
12666: man’s way of speech. He nodded slightly and she went on.
12667: 
12668: “Mr. Jonah Featherstone and young Cranch are sleeping here.”
12669: 
12670: “Oh ay, they stick, do they? and the rest—they come every day, I’ll
12671: warrant—Solomon and Jane, and all the young uns? They come peeping, and
12672: counting and casting up?”
12673: 
12674: “Not all of them every day. Mr. Solomon and Mrs. Waule are here every
12675: day, and the others come often.”
12676: 
12677: The old man listened with a grimace while she spoke, and then said,
12678: relaxing his face, “The more fools they. You hearken, missy. It’s three
12679: o’clock in the morning, and I’ve got all my faculties as well as ever I
12680: had in my life. I know all my property, and where the money’s put out,
12681: and everything. And I’ve made everything ready to change my mind, and
12682: do as I like at the last. Do you hear, missy? I’ve got my faculties.”
12683: 
12684: “Well, sir?” said Mary, quietly.
12685: 
12686: He now lowered his tone with an air of deeper cunning. “I’ve made two
12687: wills, and I’m going to burn one. Now you do as I tell you. This is the
12688: key of my iron chest, in the closet there. You push well at the side of
12689: the brass plate at the top, till it goes like a bolt: then you can put
12690: the key in the front lock and turn it. See and do that; and take out
12691: the topmost paper—Last Will and Testament—big printed.”
12692: 
12693: “No, sir,” said Mary, in a firm voice, “I cannot do that.”
12694: 
12695: “Not do it? I tell you, you must,” said the old man, his voice
12696: beginning to shake under the shock of this resistance.
12697: 
12698: “I cannot touch your iron chest or your will. I must refuse to do
12699: anything that might lay me open to suspicion.”
12700: 
12701: “I tell you, I’m in my right mind. Shan’t I do as I like at the last? I
12702: made two wills on purpose. Take the key, I say.”
12703: 
12704: “No, sir, I will not,” said Mary, more resolutely still. Her repulsion
12705: was getting stronger.
12706: 
12707: “I tell you, there’s no time to lose.”
12708: 
12709: “I cannot help that, sir. I will not let the close of your life soil
12710: the beginning of mine. I will not touch your iron chest or your will.”
12711: She moved to a little distance from the bedside.
12712: 
12713: The old man paused with a blank stare for a little while, holding the
12714: one key erect on the ring; then with an agitated jerk he began to work
12715: with his bony left hand at emptying the tin box before him.
12716: 
12717: “Missy,” he began to say, hurriedly, “look here! take the money—the
12718: notes and gold—look here—take it—you shall have it all—do as I tell
12719: you.”
12720: 
12721: He made an effort to stretch out the key towards her as far as
12722: possible, and Mary again retreated.
12723: 
12724: “I will not touch your key or your money, sir. Pray don’t ask me to do
12725: it again. If you do, I must go and call your brother.”
12726: 
12727: He let his hand fall, and for the first time in her life Mary saw old
12728: Peter Featherstone begin to cry childishly. She said, in as gentle a
12729: tone as she could command, “Pray put up your money, sir;” and then went
12730: away to her seat by the fire, hoping this would help to convince him
12731: that it was useless to say more. Presently he rallied and said eagerly—
12732: 
12733: “Look here, then. Call the young chap. Call Fred Vincy.”
12734: 
12735: Mary’s heart began to beat more quickly. Various ideas rushed through
12736: her mind as to what the burning of a second will might imply. She had
12737: to make a difficult decision in a hurry.
12738: 
12739: “I will call him, if you will let me call Mr. Jonah and others with
12740: him.”
12741: 
12742: “Nobody else, I say. The young chap. I shall do as I like.”
12743: 
12744: “Wait till broad daylight, sir, when every one is stirring. Or let me
12745: call Simmons now, to go and fetch the lawyer? He can be here in less
12746: than two hours.”
12747: 
12748: “Lawyer? What do I want with the lawyer? Nobody shall know—I say,
12749: nobody shall know. I shall do as I like.”
12750: 
12751: “Let me call some one else, sir,” said Mary, persuasively. She did not
12752: like her position—alone with the old man, who seemed to show a strange
12753: flaring of nervous energy which enabled him to speak again and again
12754: without falling into his usual cough; yet she desired not to push
12755: unnecessarily the contradiction which agitated him. “Let me, pray, call
12756: some one else.”
12757: 
12758: “You let me alone, I say. Look here, missy. Take the money. You’ll
12759: never have the chance again. It’s pretty nigh two hundred—there’s more
12760: in the box, and nobody knows how much there was. Take it and do as I
12761: tell you.”
12762: 
12763: Mary, standing by the fire, saw its red light falling on the old man,
12764: propped up on his pillows and bed-rest, with his bony hand holding out
12765: the key, and the money lying on the quilt before him. She never forgot
12766: that vision of a man wanting to do as he liked at the last. But the way
12767: in which he had put the offer of the money urged her to speak with
12768: harder resolution than ever.
12769: 
12770: “It is of no use, sir. I will not do it. Put up your money. I will not
12771: touch your money. I will do anything else I can to comfort you; but I
12772: will not touch your keys or your money.”
12773: 
12774: “Anything else—anything else!” said old Featherstone, with hoarse rage,
12775: which, as if in a nightmare, tried to be loud, and yet was only just
12776: audible. “I want nothing else. You come here—you come here.”
12777: 
12778: Mary approached him cautiously, knowing him too well. She saw him
12779: dropping his keys and trying to grasp his stick, while he looked at her
12780: like an aged hyena, the muscles of his face getting distorted with the
12781: effort of his hand. She paused at a safe distance.
12782: 
12783: “Let me give you some cordial,” she said, quietly, “and try to compose
12784: yourself. You will perhaps go to sleep. And to-morrow by daylight you
12785: can do as you like.”
12786: 
12787: He lifted the stick, in spite of her being beyond his reach, and threw
12788: it with a hard effort which was but impotence. It fell, slipping over
12789: the foot of the bed. Mary let it lie, and retreated to her chair by the
12790: fire. By-and-by she would go to him with the cordial. Fatigue would
12791: make him passive. It was getting towards the chillest moment of the
12792: morning, the fire had got low, and she could see through the chink
12793: between the moreen window-curtains the light whitened by the blind.
12794: Having put some wood on the fire and thrown a shawl over her, she sat
12795: down, hoping that Mr. Featherstone might now fall asleep. If she went
12796: near him the irritation might be kept up. He had said nothing after
12797: throwing the stick, but she had seen him taking his keys again and
12798: laying his right hand on the money. He did not put it up, however, and
12799: she thought that he was dropping off to sleep.
12800: 
12801: But Mary herself began to be more agitated by the remembrance of what
12802: she had gone through, than she had been by the reality—questioning
12803: those acts of hers which had come imperatively and excluded all
12804: question in the critical moment.
12805: 
12806: Presently the dry wood sent out a flame which illuminated every
12807: crevice, and Mary saw that the old man was lying quietly with his head
12808: turned a little on one side. She went towards him with inaudible steps,
12809: and thought that his face looked strangely motionless; but the next
12810: moment the movement of the flame communicating itself to all objects
12811: made her uncertain. The violent beating of her heart rendered her
12812: perceptions so doubtful that even when she touched him and listened for
12813: his breathing, she could not trust her conclusions. She went to the
12814: window and gently propped aside the curtain and blind, so that the
12815: still light of the sky fell on the bed.
12816: 
12817: The next moment she ran to the bell and rang it energetically. In a
12818: very little while there was no longer any doubt that Peter Featherstone
12819: was dead, with his right hand clasping the keys, and his left hand
12820: lying on the heap of notes and gold.

12831: CHAPTER XXXIV.
12832: 
12833: “1_st Gent_. Such men as this are feathers, chips, and straws,
12834:     Carry no weight, no force.
12835: 
12836: 2_d Gent_. But levity
12837:     Is causal too, and makes the sum of weight.
12838:     For power finds its place in lack of power;
12839:     Advance is cession, and the driven ship
12840:     May run aground because the helmsman’s thought
12841:     Lacked force to balance opposites.”
12842: 
12843: 
12844: It was on a morning of May that Peter Featherstone was buried. In the
12845: prosaic neighborhood of Middlemarch, May was not always warm and sunny,
12846: and on this particular morning a chill wind was blowing the blossoms
12847: from the surrounding gardens on to the green mounds of Lowick
12848: churchyard. Swiftly moving clouds only now and then allowed a gleam to
12849: light up any object, whether ugly or beautiful, that happened to stand
12850: within its golden shower. In the churchyard the objects were remarkably
12851: various, for there was a little country crowd waiting to see the
12852: funeral. The news had spread that it was to be a “big burying;” the old
12853: gentleman had left written directions about everything and meant to
12854: have a funeral “beyond his betters.” This was true; for old
12855: Featherstone had not been a Harpagon whose passions had all been
12856: devoured by the ever-lean and ever-hungry passion of saving, and who
12857: would drive a bargain with his undertaker beforehand. He loved money,
12858: but he also loved to spend it in gratifying his peculiar tastes, and
12859: perhaps he loved it best of all as a means of making others feel his
12860: power more or less uncomfortably. If any one will here contend that
12861: there must have been traits of goodness in old Featherstone, I will not
12862: presume to deny this; but I must observe that goodness is of a modest
12863: nature, easily discouraged, and when much privacy, elbowed in early
12864: life by unabashed vices, is apt to retire into extreme privacy, so that
12865: it is more easily believed in by those who construct a selfish old
12866: gentleman theoretically, than by those who form the narrower judgments
12867: based on his personal acquaintance. In any case, he had been bent on
12868: having a handsome funeral, and on having persons “bid” to it who would
12869: rather have stayed at home. He had even desired that female relatives
12870: should follow him to the grave, and poor sister Martha had taken a
12871: difficult journey for this purpose from the Chalky Flats. She and Jane
12872: would have been altogether cheered (in a tearful manner) by this sign
12873: that a brother who disliked seeing them while he was living had been
12874: prospectively fond of their presence when he should have become a
12875: testator, if the sign had not been made equivocal by being extended to
12876: Mrs. Vincy, whose expense in handsome crape seemed to imply the most
12877: presumptuous hopes, aggravated by a bloom of complexion which told
12878: pretty plainly that she was not a blood-relation, but of that generally
12879: objectionable class called wife’s kin.
12880: 
12881: We are all of us imaginative in some form or other, for images are the
12882: brood of desire; and poor old Featherstone, who laughed much at the way
12883: in which others cajoled themselves, did not escape the fellowship of
12884: illusion. In writing the programme for his burial he certainly did not
12885: make clear to himself that his pleasure in the little drama of which it
12886: formed a part was confined to anticipation. In chuckling over the
12887: vexations he could inflict by the rigid clutch of his dead hand, he
12888: inevitably mingled his consciousness with that livid stagnant presence,
12889: and so far as he was preoccupied with a future life, it was with one of
12890: gratification inside his coffin. Thus old Featherstone was imaginative,
12891: after his fashion.
12892: 
12893: However, the three mourning-coaches were filled according to the
12894: written orders of the deceased. There were pall-bearers on horseback,
12895: with the richest scarfs and hatbands, and even the under-bearers had
12896: trappings of woe which were of a good well-priced quality. The black
12897: procession, when dismounted, looked the larger for the smallness of the
12898: churchyard; the heavy human faces and the black draperies shivering in
12899: the wind seemed to tell of a world strangely incongruous with the
12900: lightly dropping blossoms and the gleams of sunshine on the daisies.
12901: The clergyman who met the procession was Mr. Cadwallader—also according
12902: to the request of Peter Featherstone, prompted as usual by peculiar
12903: reasons. Having a contempt for curates, whom he always called
12904: understrappers, he was resolved to be buried by a beneficed clergyman.
12905: Mr. Casaubon was out of the question, not merely because he declined
12906: duty of this sort, but because Featherstone had an especial dislike to
12907: him as the rector of his own parish, who had a lien on the land in the
12908: shape of tithe, also as the deliverer of morning sermons, which the old
12909: man, being in his pew and not at all sleepy, had been obliged to sit
12910: through with an inward snarl. He had an objection to a parson stuck up
12911: above his head preaching to him. But his relations with Mr. Cadwallader
12912: had been of a different kind: the trout-stream which ran through Mr.
12913: Casaubon’s land took its course through Featherstone’s also, so that
12914: Mr. Cadwallader was a parson who had had to ask a favor instead of
12915: preaching. Moreover, he was one of the high gentry living four miles
12916: away from Lowick, and was thus exalted to an equal sky with the sheriff
12917: of the county and other dignities vaguely regarded as necessary to the
12918: system of things. There would be a satisfaction in being buried by Mr.
12919: Cadwallader, whose very name offered a fine opportunity for pronouncing
12920: wrongly if you liked.
12921: 
12922: This distinction conferred on the Rector of Tipton and Freshitt was the
12923: reason why Mrs. Cadwallader made one of the group that watched old
12924: Featherstone’s funeral from an upper window of the manor. She was not
12925: fond of visiting that house, but she liked, as she said, to see
12926: collections of strange animals such as there would be at this funeral;
12927: and she had persuaded Sir James and the young Lady Chettam to drive the
12928: Rector and herself to Lowick in order that the visit might be
12929: altogether pleasant.
12930: 
12931: “I will go anywhere with you, Mrs. Cadwallader,” Celia had said; “but I
12932: don’t like funerals.”
12933: 
12934: “Oh, my dear, when you have a clergyman in your family you must
12935: accommodate your tastes: I did that very early. When I married Humphrey
12936: I made up my mind to like sermons, and I set out by liking the end very
12937: much. That soon spread to the middle and the beginning, because I
12938: couldn’t have the end without them.”
12939: 
12940: “No, to be sure not,” said the Dowager Lady Chettam, with stately
12941: emphasis.
12942: 
12943: The upper window from which the funeral could be well seen was in the
12944: room occupied by Mr. Casaubon when he had been forbidden to work; but
12945: he had resumed nearly his habitual style of life now in spite of
12946: warnings and prescriptions, and after politely welcoming Mrs.
12947: Cadwallader had slipped again into the library to chew a cud of erudite
12948: mistake about Cush and Mizraim.
12949: 
12950: But for her visitors Dorothea too might have been shut up in the
12951: library, and would not have witnessed this scene of old Featherstone’s
12952: funeral, which, aloof as it seemed to be from the tenor of her life,
12953: always afterwards came back to her at the touch of certain sensitive
12954: points in memory, just as the vision of St. Peter’s at Rome was inwoven
12955: with moods of despondency. Scenes which make vital changes in our
12956: neighbors’ lot are but the background of our own, yet, like a
12957: particular aspect of the fields and trees, they become associated for
12958: us with the epochs of our own history, and make a part of that unity
12959: which lies in the selection of our keenest consciousness.
12960: 
12961: The dream-like association of something alien and ill-understood with
12962: the deepest secrets of her experience seemed to mirror that sense of
12963: loneliness which was due to the very ardor of Dorothea’s nature. The
12964: country gentry of old time lived in a rarefied social air: dotted apart
12965: on their stations up the mountain they looked down with imperfect
12966: discrimination on the belts of thicker life below. And Dorothea was not
12967: at ease in the perspective and chilliness of that height.
12968: 
12969: “I shall not look any more,” said Celia, after the train had entered
12970: the church, placing herself a little behind her husband’s elbow so that
12971: she could slyly touch his coat with her cheek. “I dare say Dodo likes
12972: it: she is fond of melancholy things and ugly people.”
12973: 
12974: “I am fond of knowing something about the people I live among,” said
12975: Dorothea, who had been watching everything with the interest of a monk
12976: on his holiday tour. “It seems to me we know nothing of our neighbors,
12977: unless they are cottagers. One is constantly wondering what sort of
12978: lives other people lead, and how they take things. I am quite obliged
12979: to Mrs. Cadwallader for coming and calling me out of the library.”
12980: 
12981: “Quite right to feel obliged to me,” said Mrs. Cadwallader. “Your rich
12982: Lowick farmers are as curious as any buffaloes or bisons, and I dare
12983: say you don’t half see them at church. They are quite different from
12984: your uncle’s tenants or Sir James’s—monsters—farmers without
12985: landlords—one can’t tell how to class them.”
12986: 
12987: “Most of these followers are not Lowick people,” said Sir James; “I
12988: suppose they are legatees from a distance, or from Middlemarch.
12989: Lovegood tells me the old fellow has left a good deal of money as well
12990: as land.”
12991: 
12992: “Think of that now! when so many younger sons can’t dine at their own
12993: expense,” said Mrs. Cadwallader. “Ah,” turning round at the sound of
12994: the opening door, “here is Mr. Brooke. I felt that we were incomplete
12995: before, and here is the explanation. You are come to see this odd
12996: funeral, of course?”
12997: 
12998: “No, I came to look after Casaubon—to see how he goes on, you know. And
12999: to bring a little news—a little news, my dear,” said Mr. Brooke,
13000: nodding at Dorothea as she came towards him. “I looked into the
13001: library, and I saw Casaubon over his books. I told him it wouldn’t do:
13002: I said, ‘This will never do, you know: think of your wife, Casaubon.’
13003: And he promised me to come up. I didn’t tell him my news: I said, he
13004: must come up.”
13005: 
13006: “Ah, now they are coming out of church,” Mrs. Cadwallader exclaimed.
13007: “Dear me, what a wonderfully mixed set! Mr. Lydgate as doctor, I
13008: suppose. But that is really a good looking woman, and the fair young
13009: man must be her son. Who are they, Sir James, do you know?”
13010: 
13011: “I see Vincy, the Mayor of Middlemarch; they are probably his wife and
13012: son,” said Sir James, looking interrogatively at Mr. Brooke, who nodded
13013: and said—
13014: 
13015: “Yes, a very decent family—a very good fellow is Vincy; a credit to the
13016: manufacturing interest. You have seen him at my house, you know.”
13017: 
13018: “Ah, yes: one of your secret committee,” said Mrs. Cadwallader,
13019: provokingly.
13020: 
13021: “A coursing fellow, though,” said Sir James, with a fox-hunter’s
13022: disgust.
13023: 
13024: “And one of those who suck the life out of the wretched handloom
13025: weavers in Tipton and Freshitt. That is how his family look so fair and
13026: sleek,” said Mrs. Cadwallader. “Those dark, purple-faced people are an
13027: excellent foil. Dear me, they are like a set of jugs! Do look at
13028: Humphrey: one might fancy him an ugly archangel towering above them in
13029: his white surplice.”
13030: 
13031: “It’s a solemn thing, though, a funeral,” said Mr. Brooke, “if you take
13032: it in that light, you know.”
13033: 
13034: “But I am not taking it in that light. I can’t wear my solemnity too
13035: often, else it will go to rags. It was time the old man died, and none
13036: of these people are sorry.”
13037: 
13038: “How piteous!” said Dorothea. “This funeral seems to me the most dismal
13039: thing I ever saw. It is a blot on the morning. I cannot bear to think
13040: that any one should die and leave no love behind.”
13041: 
13042: She was going to say more, but she saw her husband enter and seat
13043: himself a little in the background. The difference his presence made to
13044: her was not always a happy one: she felt that he often inwardly
13045: objected to her speech.
13046: 
13047: “Positively,” exclaimed Mrs. Cadwallader, “there is a new face come out
13048: from behind that broad man queerer than any of them: a little round
13049: head with bulging eyes—a sort of frog-face—do look. He must be of
13050: another blood, I think.”
13051: 
13052: “Let me see!” said Celia, with awakened curiosity, standing behind Mrs.
13053: Cadwallader and leaning forward over her head. “Oh, what an odd face!”
13054: Then with a quick change to another sort of surprised expression, she
13055: added, “Why, Dodo, you never told me that Mr. Ladislaw was come again!”
13056: 
13057: Dorothea felt a shock of alarm: every one noticed her sudden paleness
13058: as she looked up immediately at her uncle, while Mr. Casaubon looked at
13059: her.
13060: 
13061: “He came with me, you know; he is my guest—puts up with me at the
13062: Grange,” said Mr. Brooke, in his easiest tone, nodding at Dorothea, as
13063: if the announcement were just what she might have expected. “And we
13064: have brought the picture at the top of the carriage. I knew you would
13065: be pleased with the surprise, Casaubon. There you are to the very
13066: life—as Aquinas, you know. Quite the right sort of thing. And you will
13067: hear young Ladislaw talk about it. He talks uncommonly well—points out
13068: this, that, and the other—knows art and everything of that
13069: kind—companionable, you know—is up with you in any track—what I’ve been
13070: wanting a long while.”
13071: 
13072: Mr. Casaubon bowed with cold politeness, mastering his irritation, but
13073: only so far as to be silent. He remembered Will’s letter quite as well
13074: as Dorothea did; he had noticed that it was not among the letters which
13075: had been reserved for him on his recovery, and secretly concluding that
13076: Dorothea had sent word to Will not to come to Lowick, he had shrunk
13077: with proud sensitiveness from ever recurring to the subject. He now
13078: inferred that she had asked her uncle to invite Will to the Grange; and
13079: she felt it impossible at that moment to enter into any explanation.
13080: 
13081: Mrs. Cadwallader’s eyes, diverted from the churchyard, saw a good deal
13082: of dumb show which was not so intelligible to her as she could have
13083: desired, and could not repress the question, “Who is Mr. Ladislaw?”
13084: 
13085: “A young relative of Mr. Casaubon’s,” said Sir James, promptly. His
13086: good-nature often made him quick and clear-seeing in personal matters,
13087: and he had divined from Dorothea’s glance at her husband that there was
13088: some alarm in her mind.
13089: 
13090: “A very nice young fellow—Casaubon has done everything for him,”
13091: explained Mr. Brooke. “He repays your expense in him, Casaubon,” he
13092: went on, nodding encouragingly. “I hope he will stay with me a long
13093: while and we shall make something of my documents. I have plenty of
13094: ideas and facts, you know, and I can see he is just the man to put them
13095: into shape—remembers what the right quotations are, _omne tulit
13096: punctum_, and that sort of thing—gives subjects a kind of turn. I
13097: invited him some time ago when you were ill, Casaubon; Dorothea said
13098: you couldn’t have anybody in the house, you know, and she asked me to
13099: write.”
13100: 
13101: Poor Dorothea felt that every word of her uncle’s was about as pleasant
13102: as a grain of sand in the eye to Mr. Casaubon. It would be altogether
13103: unfitting now to explain that she had not wished her uncle to invite
13104: Will Ladislaw. She could not in the least make clear to herself the
13105: reasons for her husband’s dislike to his presence—a dislike painfully
13106: impressed on her by the scene in the library; but she felt the
13107: unbecomingness of saying anything that might convey a notion of it to
13108: others. Mr. Casaubon, indeed, had not thoroughly represented those
13109: mixed reasons to himself; irritated feeling with him, as with all of
13110: us, seeking rather for justification than for self-knowledge. But he
13111: wished to repress outward signs, and only Dorothea could discern the
13112: changes in her husband’s face before he observed with more of dignified
13113: bending and sing-song than usual—
13114: 
13115: “You are exceedingly hospitable, my dear sir; and I owe you
13116: acknowledgments for exercising your hospitality towards a relative of
13117: mine.”
13118: 
13119: The funeral was ended now, and the churchyard was being cleared.
13120: 
13121: “Now you can see him, Mrs. Cadwallader,” said Celia. “He is just like a
13122: miniature of Mr. Casaubon’s aunt that hangs in Dorothea’s boudoir—quite
13123: nice-looking.”
13124: 
13125: “A very pretty sprig,” said Mrs. Cadwallader, dryly. “What is your
13126: nephew to be, Mr. Casaubon?”
13127: 
13128: “Pardon me, he is not my nephew. He is my cousin.”
13129: 
13130: “Well, you know,” interposed Mr. Brooke, “he is trying his wings. He is
13131: just the sort of young fellow to rise. I should be glad to give him an
13132: opportunity. He would make a good secretary, now, like Hobbes, Milton,
13133: Swift—that sort of man.”
13134: 
13135: “I understand,” said Mrs. Cadwallader. “One who can write speeches.”
13136: 
13137: “I’ll fetch him in now, eh, Casaubon?” said Mr. Brooke. “He wouldn’t
13138: come in till I had announced him, you know. And we’ll go down and look
13139: at the picture. There you are to the life: a deep subtle sort of
13140: thinker with his fore-finger on the page, while Saint Bonaventure or
13141: somebody else, rather fat and florid, is looking up at the Trinity.
13142: Everything is symbolical, you know—the higher style of art: I like that
13143: up to a certain point, but not too far—it’s rather straining to keep up
13144: with, you know. But you are at home in that, Casaubon. And your
13145: painter’s flesh is good—solidity, transparency, everything of that
13146: sort. I went into that a great deal at one time. However, I’ll go and
13147: fetch Ladislaw.”
13148: 
13149: 
13150: 
13151: 
13152: CHAPTER XXXV.
13153: 
13154: “Non, je ne comprends pas de plus charmant plaisir
13155: Que de voir d’héritiers une troupe affligée
13156: Le maintien interdit, et la mine allongée,
13157: Lire un long testament où pales, étonnés
13158: On leur laisse un bonsoir avec un pied de nez.
13159: Pour voir au naturel leur tristesse profonde
13160: Je reviendrais, je crois, exprès de l’autre monde.”
13161: —REGNARD: _Le Légataire Universel_.
13162: 
13163: 
13164: When the animals entered the Ark in pairs, one may imagine that allied
13165: species made much private remark on each other, and were tempted to
13166: think that so many forms feeding on the same store of fodder were
13167: eminently superfluous, as tending to diminish the rations. (I fear the
13168: part played by the vultures on that occasion would be too painful for
13169: art to represent, those birds being disadvantageously naked about the
13170: gullet, and apparently without rites and ceremonies.)
13171: 
13172: The same sort of temptation befell the Christian Carnivora who formed
13173: Peter Featherstone’s funeral procession; most of them having their
13174: minds bent on a limited store which each would have liked to get the
13175: most of. The long-recognized blood-relations and connections by
13176: marriage made already a goodly number, which, multiplied by
13177: possibilities, presented a fine range for jealous conjecture and
13178: pathetic hopefulness. Jealousy of the Vincys had created a fellowship
13179: in hostility among all persons of the Featherstone blood, so that in
13180: the absence of any decided indication that one of themselves was to
13181: have more than the rest, the dread lest that long-legged Fred Vincy
13182: should have the land was necessarily dominant, though it left abundant
13183: feeling and leisure for vaguer jealousies, such as were entertained
13184: towards Mary Garth. Solomon found time to reflect that Jonah was
13185: undeserving, and Jonah to abuse Solomon as greedy; Jane, the elder
13186: sister, held that Martha’s children ought not to expect so much as the
13187: young Waules; and Martha, more lax on the subject of primogeniture, was
13188: sorry to think that Jane was so “having.” These nearest of kin were
13189: naturally impressed with the unreasonableness of expectations in
13190: cousins and second cousins, and used their arithmetic in reckoning the
13191: large sums that small legacies might mount to, if there were too many
13192: of them. Two cousins were present to hear the will, and a second cousin
13193: besides Mr. Trumbull. This second cousin was a Middlemarch mercer of
13194: polite manners and superfluous aspirates. The two cousins were elderly
13195: men from Brassing, one of them conscious of claims on the score of
13196: inconvenient expense sustained by him in presents of oysters and other
13197: eatables to his rich cousin Peter; the other entirely saturnine,
13198: leaning his hands and chin on a stick, and conscious of claims based on
13199: no narrow performance but on merit generally: both blameless citizens
13200: of Brassing, who wished that Jonah Featherstone did not live there. The
13201: wit of a family is usually best received among strangers.
13202: 
13203: “Why, Trumbull himself is pretty sure of five hundred—_that_ you may
13204: depend,—I shouldn’t wonder if my brother promised him,” said Solomon,
13205: musing aloud with his sisters, the evening before the funeral.
13206: 
13207: “Dear, dear!” said poor sister Martha, whose imagination of hundreds
13208: had been habitually narrowed to the amount of her unpaid rent.
13209: 
13210: But in the morning all the ordinary currents of conjecture were
13211: disturbed by the presence of a strange mourner who had plashed among
13212: them as if from the moon. This was the stranger described by Mrs.
13213: Cadwallader as frog-faced: a man perhaps about two or three and thirty,
13214: whose prominent eyes, thin-lipped, downward-curved mouth, and hair
13215: sleekly brushed away from a forehead that sank suddenly above the ridge
13216: of the eyebrows, certainly gave his face a batrachian unchangeableness
13217: of expression. Here, clearly, was a new legatee; else why was he bidden
13218: as a mourner? Here were new possibilities, raising a new uncertainty,
13219: which almost checked remark in the mourning-coaches. We are all
13220: humiliated by the sudden discovery of a fact which has existed very
13221: comfortably and perhaps been staring at us in private while we have
13222: been making up our world entirely without it. No one had seen this
13223: questionable stranger before except Mary Garth, and she knew nothing
13224: more of him than that he had twice been to Stone Court when Mr.
13225: Featherstone was down-stairs, and had sat alone with him for several
13226: hours. She had found an opportunity of mentioning this to her father,
13227: and perhaps Caleb’s were the only eyes, except the lawyer’s, which
13228: examined the stranger with more of inquiry than of disgust or
13229: suspicion. Caleb Garth, having little expectation and less cupidity,
13230: was interested in the verification of his own guesses, and the calmness
13231: with which he half smilingly rubbed his chin and shot intelligent
13232: glances much as if he were valuing a tree, made a fine contrast with
13233: the alarm or scorn visible in other faces when the unknown mourner,
13234: whose name was understood to be Rigg, entered the wainscoted parlor and
13235: took his seat near the door to make part of the audience when the will
13236: should be read. Just then Mr. Solomon and Mr. Jonah were gone up-stairs
13237: with the lawyer to search for the will; and Mrs. Waule, seeing two
13238: vacant seats between herself and Mr. Borthrop Trumbull, had the spirit
13239: to move next to that great authority, who was handling his watch-seals
13240: and trimming his outlines with a determination not to show anything so
13241: compromising to a man of ability as wonder or surprise.
13242: 
13243: “I suppose you know everything about what my poor brother’s done, Mr.
13244: Trumbull,” said Mrs. Waule, in the lowest of her woolly tones, while
13245: she turned her crape-shadowed bonnet towards Mr. Trumbull’s ear.
13246: 
13247: “My good lady, whatever was told me was told in confidence,” said the
13248: auctioneer, putting his hand up to screen that secret.
13249: 
13250: “Them who’ve made sure of their good-luck may be disappointed yet,”
13251: Mrs. Waule continued, finding some relief in this communication.
13252: 
13253: “Hopes are often delusive,” said Mr. Trumbull, still in confidence.
13254: 
13255: “Ah!” said Mrs. Waule, looking across at the Vincys, and then moving
13256: back to the side of her sister Martha.
13257: 
13258: “It’s wonderful how close poor Peter was,” she said, in the same
13259: undertones. “We none of us know what he might have had on his mind. I
13260: only hope and trust he wasn’t a worse liver than we think of, Martha.”
13261: 
13262: Poor Mrs. Cranch was bulky, and, breathing asthmatically, had the
13263: additional motive for making her remarks unexceptionable and giving
13264: them a general bearing, that even her whispers were loud and liable to
13265: sudden bursts like those of a deranged barrel-organ.
13266: 
13267: “I never _was_ covetous, Jane,” she replied; “but I have six children
13268: and have buried three, and I didn’t marry into money. The eldest, that
13269: sits there, is but nineteen—so I leave you to guess. And stock always
13270: short, and land most awkward. But if ever I’ve begged and prayed; it’s
13271: been to God above; though where there’s one brother a bachelor and the
13272: other childless after twice marrying—anybody might think!”
13273: 
13274: Meanwhile, Mr. Vincy had glanced at the passive face of Mr. Rigg, and
13275: had taken out his snuff-box and tapped it, but had put it again
13276: unopened as an indulgence which, however clarifying to the judgment,
13277: was unsuited to the occasion. “I shouldn’t wonder if Featherstone had
13278: better feelings than any of us gave him credit for,” he observed, in
13279: the ear of his wife. “This funeral shows a thought about everybody: it
13280: looks well when a man wants to be followed by his friends, and if they
13281: are humble, not to be ashamed of them. I should be all the better
13282: pleased if he’d left lots of small legacies. They may be uncommonly
13283: useful to fellows in a small way.”
13284: 
13285: “Everything is as handsome as could be, crape and silk and everything,”
13286: said Mrs. Vincy, contentedly.
13287: 
13288: But I am sorry to say that Fred was under some difficulty in repressing
13289: a laugh, which would have been more unsuitable than his father’s
13290: snuff-box. Fred had overheard Mr. Jonah suggesting something about a
13291: “love-child,” and with this thought in his mind, the stranger’s face,
13292: which happened to be opposite him, affected him too ludicrously. Mary
13293: Garth, discerning his distress in the twitchings of his mouth, and his
13294: recourse to a cough, came cleverly to his rescue by asking him to
13295: change seats with her, so that he got into a shadowy corner. Fred was
13296: feeling as good-naturedly as possible towards everybody, including
13297: Rigg; and having some relenting towards all these people who were less
13298: lucky than he was aware of being himself, he would not for the world
13299: have behaved amiss; still, it was particularly easy to laugh.
13300: 
13301: But the entrance of the lawyer and the two brothers drew every one’s
13302: attention. The lawyer was Mr. Standish, and he had come to Stone Court
13303: this morning believing that he knew thoroughly well who would be
13304: pleased and who disappointed before the day was over. The will he
13305: expected to read was the last of three which he had drawn up for Mr.
13306: Featherstone. Mr. Standish was not a man who varied his manners: he
13307: behaved with the same deep-voiced, off-hand civility to everybody, as
13308: if he saw no difference in them, and talked chiefly of the hay-crop,
13309: which would be “very fine, by God!” of the last bulletins concerning
13310: the King, and of the Duke of Clarence, who was a sailor every inch of
13311: him, and just the man to rule over an island like Britain.
13312: 
13313: Old Featherstone had often reflected as he sat looking at the fire that
13314: Standish would be surprised some day: it is true that if he had done as
13315: he liked at the last, and burnt the will drawn up by another lawyer, he
13316: would not have secured that minor end; still he had had his pleasure in
13317: ruminating on it. And certainly Mr. Standish was surprised, but not at
13318: all sorry; on the contrary, he rather enjoyed the zest of a little
13319: curiosity in his own mind, which the discovery of a second will added
13320: to the prospective amazement on the part of the Featherstone family.
13321: 
13322: As to the sentiments of Solomon and Jonah, they were held in utter
13323: suspense: it seemed to them that the old will would have a certain
13324: validity, and that there might be such an interlacement of poor Peter’s
13325: former and latter intentions as to create endless “lawing” before
13326: anybody came by their own—an inconvenience which would have at least
13327: the advantage of going all round. Hence the brothers showed a
13328: thoroughly neutral gravity as they re-entered with Mr. Standish; but
13329: Solomon took out his white handkerchief again with a sense that in any
13330: case there would be affecting passages, and crying at funerals, however
13331: dry, was customarily served up in lawn.
13332: 
13333: Perhaps the person who felt the most throbbing excitement at this
13334: moment was Mary Garth, in the consciousness that it was she who had
13335: virtually determined the production of this second will, which might
13336: have momentous effects on the lot of some persons present. No soul
13337: except herself knew what had passed on that final night.
13338: 
13339: “The will I hold in my hand,” said Mr. Standish, who, seated at the
13340: table in the middle of the room, took his time about everything,
13341: including the coughs with which he showed a disposition to clear his
13342: voice, “was drawn up by myself and executed by our deceased friend on
13343: the 9th of August, 1825. But I find that there is a subsequent
13344: instrument hitherto unknown to me, bearing date the 20th of July, 1826,
13345: hardly a year later than the previous one. And there is farther, I
13346: see”—Mr. Standish was cautiously travelling over the document with his
13347: spectacles—“a codicil to this latter will, bearing date March 1, 1828.”
13348: 
13349: “Dear, dear!” said sister Martha, not meaning to be audible, but driven
13350: to some articulation under this pressure of dates.
13351: 
13352: “I shall begin by reading the earlier will,” continued Mr. Standish,
13353: “since such, as appears by his not having destroyed the document, was
13354: the intention of deceased.”
13355: 
13356: The preamble was felt to be rather long, and several besides Solomon
13357: shook their heads pathetically, looking on the ground: all eyes avoided
13358: meeting other eyes, and were chiefly fixed either on the spots in the
13359: table-cloth or on Mr. Standish’s bald head; excepting Mary Garth’s.
13360: When all the rest were trying to look nowhere in particular, it was
13361: safe for her to look at them. And at the sound of the first “give and
13362: bequeath” she could see all complexions changing subtly, as if some
13363: faint vibration were passing through them, save that of Mr. Rigg. He
13364: sat in unaltered calm, and, in fact, the company, preoccupied with more
13365: important problems, and with the complication of listening to bequests
13366: which might or might not be revoked, had ceased to think of him. Fred
13367: blushed, and Mr. Vincy found it impossible to do without his snuff-box
13368: in his hand, though he kept it closed.
13369: 
13370: The small bequests came first, and even the recollection that there was
13371: another will and that poor Peter might have thought better of it, could
13372: not quell the rising disgust and indignation. One likes to be done well
13373: by in every tense, past, present, and future. And here was Peter
13374: capable five years ago of leaving only two hundred apiece to his own
13375: brothers and sisters, and only a hundred apiece to his own nephews and
13376: nieces: the Garths were not mentioned, but Mrs. Vincy and Rosamond were
13377: each to have a hundred. Mr. Trumbull was to have the gold-headed cane
13378: and fifty pounds; the other second cousins and the cousins present were
13379: each to have the like handsome sum, which, as the saturnine cousin
13380: observed, was a sort of legacy that left a man nowhere; and there was
13381: much more of such offensive dribbling in favor of persons not
13382: present—problematical, and, it was to be feared, low connections.
13383: Altogether, reckoning hastily, here were about three thousand disposed
13384: of. Where then had Peter meant the rest of the money to go—and where
13385: the land? and what was revoked and what not revoked—and was the
13386: revocation for better or for worse? All emotion must be conditional,
13387: and might turn out to be the wrong thing. The men were strong enough to
13388: bear up and keep quiet under this confused suspense; some letting their
13389: lower lip fall, others pursing it up, according to the habit of their
13390: muscles. But Jane and Martha sank under the rush of questions, and
13391: began to cry; poor Mrs. Cranch being half moved with the consolation of
13392: getting any hundreds at all without working for them, and half aware
13393: that her share was scanty; whereas Mrs. Waule’s mind was entirely
13394: flooded with the sense of being an own sister and getting little, while
13395: somebody else was to have much. The general expectation now was that
13396: the “much” would fall to Fred Vincy, but the Vincys themselves were
13397: surprised when ten thousand pounds in specified investments were
13398: declared to be bequeathed to him:—was the land coming too? Fred bit his
13399: lips: it was difficult to help smiling, and Mrs. Vincy felt herself the
13400: happiest of women—possible revocation shrinking out of sight in this
13401: dazzling vision.
13402: 
13403: There was still a residue of personal property as well as the land, but
13404: the whole was left to one person, and that person was—O possibilities!
13405: O expectations founded on the favor of “close” old gentlemen! O endless
13406: vocatives that would still leave expression slipping helpless from the
13407: measurement of mortal folly!—that residuary legatee was Joshua Rigg,
13408: who was also sole executor, and who was to take thenceforth the name of
13409: Featherstone.
13410: 
13411: There was a rustling which seemed like a shudder running round the
13412: room. Every one stared afresh at Mr. Rigg, who apparently experienced
13413: no surprise.
13414: 
13415: “A most singular testamentary disposition!” exclaimed Mr. Trumbull,
13416: preferring for once that he should be considered ignorant in the past.
13417: “But there is a second will—there is a further document. We have not
13418: yet heard the final wishes of the deceased.”
13419: 
13420: Mary Garth was feeling that what they had yet to hear were not the
13421: final wishes. The second will revoked everything except the legacies to
13422: the low persons before mentioned (some alterations in these being the
13423: occasion of the codicil), and the bequest of all the land lying in
13424: Lowick parish with all the stock and household furniture, to Joshua
13425: Rigg. The residue of the property was to be devoted to the erection and
13426: endowment of almshouses for old men, to be called Featherstone’s
13427: Alms-Houses, and to be built on a piece of land near Middlemarch
13428: already bought for the purpose by the testator, he wishing—so the
13429: document declared—to please God Almighty. Nobody present had a
13430: farthing; but Mr. Trumbull had the gold-headed cane. It took some time
13431: for the company to recover the power of expression. Mary dared not look
13432: at Fred.
13433: 
13434: Mr. Vincy was the first to speak—after using his snuff-box
13435: energetically—and he spoke with loud indignation. “The most
13436: unaccountable will I ever heard! I should say he was not in his right
13437: mind when he made it. I should say this last will was void,” added Mr.
13438: Vincy, feeling that this expression put the thing in the true light.
13439: “Eh Standish?”
13440: 
13441: “Our deceased friend always knew what he was about, I think,” said Mr.
13442: Standish. “Everything is quite regular. Here is a letter from Clemmens
13443: of Brassing tied with the will. He drew it up. A very respectable
13444: solicitor.”
13445: 
13446: “I never noticed any alienation of mind—any aberration of intellect in
13447: the late Mr. Featherstone,” said Borthrop Trumbull, “but I call this
13448: will eccentric. I was always willingly of service to the old soul; and
13449: he intimated pretty plainly a sense of obligation which would show
13450: itself in his will. The gold-headed cane is farcical considered as an
13451: acknowledgment to me; but happily I am above mercenary considerations.”
13452: 
13453: “There’s nothing very surprising in the matter that I can see,” said
13454: Caleb Garth. “Anybody might have had more reason for wondering if the
13455: will had been what you might expect from an open-minded straightforward
13456: man. For my part, I wish there was no such thing as a will.”
13457: 
13458: “That’s a strange sentiment to come from a Christian man, by God!” said
13459: the lawyer. “I should like to know how you will back that up, Garth!”
13460: 
13461: “Oh,” said Caleb, leaning forward, adjusting his finger-tips with
13462: nicety and looking meditatively on the ground. It always seemed to him
13463: that words were the hardest part of “business.”
13464: 
13465: But here Mr. Jonah Featherstone made himself heard. “Well, he always
13466: was a fine hypocrite, was my brother Peter. But this will cuts out
13467: everything. If I’d known, a wagon and six horses shouldn’t have drawn
13468: me from Brassing. I’ll put a white hat and drab coat on to-morrow.”
13469: 
13470: “Dear, dear,” wept Mrs. Cranch, “and we’ve been at the expense of
13471: travelling, and that poor lad sitting idle here so long! It’s the first
13472: time I ever heard my brother Peter was so wishful to please God
13473: Almighty; but if I was to be struck helpless I must say it’s hard—I can
13474: think no other.”
13475: 
13476: “It’ll do him no good where he’s gone, that’s my belief,” said Solomon,
13477: with a bitterness which was remarkably genuine, though his tone could
13478: not help being sly. “Peter was a bad liver, and almshouses won’t cover
13479: it, when he’s had the impudence to show it at the last.”
13480: 
13481: “And all the while had got his own lawful family—brothers and sisters
13482: and nephews and nieces—and has sat in church with ’em whenever he
13483: thought well to come,” said Mrs. Waule. “And might have left his
13484: property so respectable, to them that’s never been used to extravagance
13485: or unsteadiness in no manner of way—and not so poor but what they could
13486: have saved every penny and made more of it. And me—the trouble I’ve
13487: been at, times and times, to come here and be sisterly—and him with
13488: things on his mind all the while that might make anybody’s flesh creep.
13489: But if the Almighty’s allowed it, he means to punish him for it.
13490: Brother Solomon, I shall be going, if you’ll drive me.”
13491: 
13492: “I’ve no desire to put my foot on the premises again,” said Solomon.
13493: “I’ve got land of my own and property of my own to will away.”
13494: 
13495: “It’s a poor tale how luck goes in the world,” said Jonah. “It never
13496: answers to have a bit of spirit in you. You’d better be a dog in the
13497: manger. But those above ground might learn a lesson. One fool’s will is
13498: enough in a family.”
13499: 
13500: “There’s more ways than one of being a fool,” said Solomon. “I shan’t
13501: leave my money to be poured down the sink, and I shan’t leave it to
13502: foundlings from Africay. I like Featherstones that were brewed such,
13503: and not turned Featherstones with sticking the name on ’em.”
13504: 
13505: Solomon addressed these remarks in a loud aside to Mrs. Waule as he
13506: rose to accompany her. Brother Jonah felt himself capable of much more
13507: stinging wit than this, but he reflected that there was no use in
13508: offending the new proprietor of Stone Court, until you were certain
13509: that he was quite without intentions of hospitality towards witty men
13510: whose name he was about to bear.
13511: 
13512: Mr. Joshua Rigg, in fact, appeared to trouble himself little about any
13513: innuendoes, but showed a notable change of manner, walking coolly up to
13514: Mr. Standish and putting business questions with much coolness. He had
13515: a high chirping voice and a vile accent. Fred, whom he no longer moved
13516: to laughter, thought him the lowest monster he had ever seen. But Fred
13517: was feeling rather sick. The Middlemarch mercer waited for an
13518: opportunity of engaging Mr. Rigg in conversation: there was no knowing
13519: how many pairs of legs the new proprietor might require hose for, and
13520: profits were more to be relied on than legacies. Also, the mercer, as a
13521: second cousin, was dispassionate enough to feel curiosity.
13522: 
13523: Mr. Vincy, after his one outburst, had remained proudly silent, though
13524: too much preoccupied with unpleasant feelings to think of moving, till
13525: he observed that his wife had gone to Fred’s side and was crying
13526: silently while she held her darling’s hand. He rose immediately, and
13527: turning his back on the company while he said to her in an
13528: undertone,—“Don’t give way, Lucy; don’t make a fool of yourself, my
13529: dear, before these people,” he added in his usual loud voice—“Go and
13530: order the phaeton, Fred; I have no time to waste.”
13531: 
13532: Mary Garth had before this been getting ready to go home with her
13533: father. She met Fred in the hall, and now for the first time had the
13534: courage to look at him. He had that withered sort of paleness which
13535: will sometimes come on young faces, and his hand was very cold when she
13536: shook it. Mary too was agitated; she was conscious that fatally,
13537: without will of her own, she had perhaps made a great difference to
13538: Fred’s lot.
13539: 
13540: “Good-by,” she said, with affectionate sadness. “Be brave, Fred. I do
13541: believe you are better without the money. What was the good of it to
13542: Mr. Featherstone?”
13543: 
13544: “That’s all very fine,” said Fred, pettishly. “What is a fellow to do?
13545: I must go into the Church now.” (He knew that this would vex Mary: very
13546: well; then she must tell him what else he could do.) “And I thought I
13547: should be able to pay your father at once and make everything right.
13548: And you have not even a hundred pounds left you. What shall you do now,
13549: Mary?”
13550: 
13551: “Take another situation, of course, as soon as I can get one. My father
13552: has enough to do to keep the rest, without me. Good-by.”
13553: 
13554: In a very short time Stone Court was cleared of well-brewed
13555: Featherstones and other long-accustomed visitors. Another stranger had
13556: been brought to settle in the neighborhood of Middlemarch, but in the
13557: case of Mr. Rigg Featherstone there was more discontent with immediate
13558: visible consequences than speculation as to the effect which his
13559: presence might have in the future. No soul was prophetic enough to have
13560: any foreboding as to what might appear on the trial of Joshua Rigg.
13561: 
13562: And here I am naturally led to reflect on the means of elevating a low
13563: subject. Historical parallels are remarkably efficient in this way. The
13564: chief objection to them is, that the diligent narrator may lack space,
13565: or (what is often the same thing) may not be able to think of them with
13566: any degree of particularity, though he may have a philosophical
13567: confidence that if known they would be illustrative. It seems an easier
13568: and shorter way to dignity, to observe that—since there never was a
13569: true story which could not be told in parables, where you might put a
13570: monkey for a margrave, and vice versa—whatever has been or is to be
13571: narrated by me about low people, may be ennobled by being considered a
13572: parable; so that if any bad habits and ugly consequences are brought
13573: into view, the reader may have the relief of regarding them as not more
13574: than figuratively ungenteel, and may feel himself virtually in company
13575: with persons of some style. Thus while I tell the truth about loobies,
13576: my reader’s imagination need not be entirely excluded from an
13577: occupation with lords; and the petty sums which any bankrupt of high
13578: standing would be sorry to retire upon, may be lifted to the level of
13579: high commercial transactions by the inexpensive addition of
13580: proportional ciphers.
13581: 
13582: As to any provincial history in which the agents are all of high moral
13583: rank, that must be of a date long posterior to the first Reform Bill,
13584: and Peter Featherstone, you perceive, was dead and buried some months
13585: before Lord Grey came into office.
13586: 
13587: 
13588: 
13589: 
13590: CHAPTER XXXVI.
13591: 
13592: ’T is strange to see the humors of these men,
13593: These great aspiring spirits, that should be wise:
13594: . . . . . . . .
13595: For being the nature of great spirits to love
13596: To be where they may be most eminent;
13597: They, rating of themselves so farre above
13598: Us in conceit, with whom they do frequent,
13599: Imagine how we wonder and esteeme
13600: All that they do or say; which makes them strive
13601: To make our admiration more extreme,
13602: Which they suppose they cannot, ’less they give
13603: Notice of their extreme and highest thoughts.
13604: —DANIEL: _Tragedy of Philotas_.
13605: 
13606: 
13607: Mr. Vincy went home from the reading of the will with his point of view
13608: considerably changed in relation to many subjects. He was an
13609: open-minded man, but given to indirect modes of expressing himself:
13610: when he was disappointed in a market for his silk braids, he swore at
13611: the groom; when his brother-in-law Bulstrode had vexed him, he made
13612: cutting remarks on Methodism; and it was now apparent that he regarded
13613: Fred’s idleness with a sudden increase of severity, by his throwing an
13614: embroidered cap out of the smoking-room on to the hall-floor.
13615: 
13616: “Well, sir,” he observed, when that young gentleman was moving off to
13617: bed, “I hope you’ve made up your mind now to go up next term and pass
13618: your examination. I’ve taken my resolution, so I advise you to lose no
13619: time in taking yours.”
13620: 
13621: Fred made no answer: he was too utterly depressed. Twenty-four hours
13622: ago he had thought that instead of needing to know what he should do,
13623: he should by this time know that he needed to do nothing: that he
13624: should hunt in pink, have a first-rate hunter, ride to cover on a fine
13625: hack, and be generally respected for doing so; moreover, that he should
13626: be able at once to pay Mr. Garth, and that Mary could no longer have
13627: any reason for not marrying him. And all this was to have come without
13628: study or other inconvenience, purely by the favor of providence in the
13629: shape of an old gentleman’s caprice. But now, at the end of the
13630: twenty-four hours, all those firm expectations were upset. It was
13631: “rather hard lines” that while he was smarting under this
13632: disappointment he should be treated as if he could have helped it. But
13633: he went away silently and his mother pleaded for him.
13634: 
13635: “Don’t be hard on the poor boy, Vincy. He’ll turn out well yet, though
13636: that wicked man has deceived him. I feel as sure as I sit here, Fred
13637: will turn out well—else why was he brought back from the brink of the
13638: grave? And I call it a robbery: it was like giving him the land, to
13639: promise it; and what is promising, if making everybody believe is not
13640: promising? And you see he did leave him ten thousand pounds, and then
13641: took it away again.”
13642: 
13643: “Took it away again!” said Mr. Vincy, pettishly. “I tell you the lad’s
13644: an unlucky lad, Lucy. And you’ve always spoiled him.”
13645: 
13646: “Well, Vincy, he was my first, and you made a fine fuss with him when
13647: he came. You were as proud as proud,” said Mrs. Vincy, easily
13648: recovering her cheerful smile.
13649: 
13650: “Who knows what babies will turn to? I was fool enough, I dare say,”
13651: said the husband—more mildly, however.
13652: 
13653: “But who has handsomer, better children than ours? Fred is far beyond
13654: other people’s sons: you may hear it in his speech, that he has kept
13655: college company. And Rosamond—where is there a girl like her? She might
13656: stand beside any lady in the land, and only look the better for it. You
13657: see—Mr. Lydgate has kept the highest company and been everywhere, and
13658: he fell in love with her at once. Not but what I could have wished
13659: Rosamond had not engaged herself. She might have met somebody on a
13660: visit who would have been a far better match; I mean at her
13661: schoolfellow Miss Willoughby’s. There are relations in that family
13662: quite as high as Mr. Lydgate’s.”
13663: 
13664: “Damn relations!” said Mr. Vincy; “I’ve had enough of them. I don’t
13665: want a son-in-law who has got nothing but his relations to recommend
13666: him.”
13667: 
13668: “Why, my dear,” said Mrs. Vincy, “you seemed as pleased as could be
13669: about it. It’s true, I wasn’t at home; but Rosamond told me you hadn’t
13670: a word to say against the engagement. And she has begun to buy in the
13671: best linen and cambric for her underclothing.”
13672: 
13673: “Not by my will,” said Mr. Vincy. “I shall have enough to do this year,
13674: with an idle scamp of a son, without paying for wedding-clothes. The
13675: times are as tight as can be; everybody is being ruined; and I don’t
13676: believe Lydgate has got a farthing. I shan’t give my consent to their
13677: marrying. Let ’em wait, as their elders have done before ’em.”
13678: 
13679: “Rosamond will take it hard, Vincy, and you know you never could bear
13680: to cross her.”
13681: 
13682: “Yes, I could. The sooner the engagement’s off, the better. I don’t
13683: believe he’ll ever make an income, the way he goes on. He makes
13684: enemies; that’s all I hear of his making.”
13685: 
13686: “But he stands very high with Mr. Bulstrode, my dear. The marriage
13687: would please _him_, I should think.”
13688: 
13689: “Please the deuce!” said Mr. Vincy. “Bulstrode won’t pay for their
13690: keep. And if Lydgate thinks I’m going to give money for them to set up
13691: housekeeping, he’s mistaken, that’s all. I expect I shall have to put
13692: down my horses soon. You’d better tell Rosy what I say.”
13693: 
13694: This was a not infrequent procedure with Mr. Vincy—to be rash in jovial
13695: assent, and on becoming subsequently conscious that he had been rash,
13696: to employ others in making the offensive retractation. However, Mrs.
13697: Vincy, who never willingly opposed her husband, lost no time the next
13698: morning in letting Rosamond know what he had said. Rosamond, examining
13699: some muslin-work, listened in silence, and at the end gave a certain
13700: turn of her graceful neck, of which only long experience could teach
13701: you that it meant perfect obstinacy.
13702: 
13703: “What do you say, my dear?” said her mother, with affectionate
13704: deference.
13705: 
13706: “Papa does not mean anything of the kind,” said Rosamond, quite calmly.
13707: “He has always said that he wished me to marry the man I loved. And I
13708: shall marry Mr. Lydgate. It is seven weeks now since papa gave his
13709: consent. And I hope we shall have Mrs. Bretton’s house.”
13710: 
13711: “Well, my dear, I shall leave you to manage your papa. You always do
13712: manage everybody. But if we ever do go and get damask, Sadler’s is the
13713: place—far better than Hopkins’s. Mrs. Bretton’s is very large, though:
13714: I should love you to have such a house; but it will take a great deal
13715: of furniture—carpeting and everything, besides plate and glass. And you
13716: hear, your papa says he will give no money. Do you think Mr. Lydgate
13717: expects it?”
13718: 
13719: “You cannot imagine that I should ask him, mamma. Of course he
13720: understands his own affairs.”
13721: 
13722: “But he may have been looking for money, my dear, and we all thought of
13723: your having a pretty legacy as well as Fred;—and now everything is so
13724: dreadful—there’s no pleasure in thinking of anything, with that poor
13725: boy disappointed as he is.”
13726: 
13727: “That has nothing to do with my marriage, mamma. Fred must leave off
13728: being idle. I am going up-stairs to take this work to Miss Morgan: she
13729: does the open hemming very well. Mary Garth might do some work for me
13730: now, I should think. Her sewing is exquisite; it is the nicest thing I
13731: know about Mary. I should so like to have all my cambric frilling
13732: double-hemmed. And it takes a long time.”
13733: 
13734: Mrs. Vincy’s belief that Rosamond could manage her papa was well
13735: founded. Apart from his dinners and his coursing, Mr. Vincy, blustering
13736: as he was, had as little of his own way as if he had been a prime
13737: minister: the force of circumstances was easily too much for him, as it
13738: is for most pleasure-loving florid men; and the circumstance called
13739: Rosamond was particularly forcible by means of that mild persistence
13740: which, as we know, enables a white soft living substance to make its
13741: way in spite of opposing rock. Papa was not a rock: he had no other
13742: fixity than that fixity of alternating impulses sometimes called habit,
13743: and this was altogether unfavorable to his taking the only decisive
13744: line of conduct in relation to his daughter’s engagement—namely, to
13745: inquire thoroughly into Lydgate’s circumstances, declare his own
13746: inability to furnish money, and forbid alike either a speedy marriage
13747: or an engagement which must be too lengthy. That seems very simple and
13748: easy in the statement; but a disagreeable resolve formed in the chill
13749: hours of the morning had as many conditions against it as the early
13750: frost, and rarely persisted under the warming influences of the day.
13751: The indirect though emphatic expression of opinion to which Mr. Vincy
13752: was prone suffered much restraint in this case: Lydgate was a proud man
13753: towards whom innuendoes were obviously unsafe, and throwing his hat on
13754: the floor was out of the question. Mr. Vincy was a little in awe of
13755: him, a little vain that he wanted to marry Rosamond, a little
13756: indisposed to raise a question of money in which his own position was
13757: not advantageous, a little afraid of being worsted in dialogue with a
13758: man better educated and more highly bred than himself, and a little
13759: afraid of doing what his daughter would not like. The part Mr. Vincy
13760: preferred playing was that of the generous host whom nobody criticises.
13761: In the earlier half of the day there was business to hinder any formal
13762: communication of an adverse resolve; in the later there was dinner,
13763: wine, whist, and general satisfaction. And in the mean while the hours
13764: were each leaving their little deposit and gradually forming the final
13765: reason for inaction, namely, that action was too late. The accepted
13766: lover spent most of his evenings in Lowick Gate, and a love-making not
13767: at all dependent on money-advances from fathers-in-law, or prospective
13768: income from a profession, went on flourishingly under Mr. Vincy’s own
13769: eyes. Young love-making—that gossamer web! Even the points it clings
13770: to—the things whence its subtle interlacings are swung—are scarcely
13771: perceptible: momentary touches of fingertips, meetings of rays from
13772: blue and dark orbs, unfinished phrases, lightest changes of cheek and
13773: lip, faintest tremors. The web itself is made of spontaneous beliefs
13774: and indefinable joys, yearnings of one life towards another, visions of
13775: completeness, indefinite trust. And Lydgate fell to spinning that web
13776: from his inward self with wonderful rapidity, in spite of experience
13777: supposed to be finished off with the drama of Laure—in spite too of
13778: medicine and biology; for the inspection of macerated muscle or of eyes
13779: presented in a dish (like Santa Lucia’s), and other incidents of
13780: scientific inquiry, are observed to be less incompatible with poetic
13781: love than a native dulness or a lively addiction to the lowest prose.
13782: As for Rosamond, she was in the water-lily’s expanding wonderment at
13783: its own fuller life, and she too was spinning industriously at the
13784: mutual web. All this went on in the corner of the drawing-room where
13785: the piano stood, and subtle as it was, the light made it a sort of
13786: rainbow visible to many observers besides Mr. Farebrother. The
13787: certainty that Miss Vincy and Mr. Lydgate were engaged became general
13788: in Middlemarch without the aid of formal announcement.
13789: 
13790: Aunt Bulstrode was again stirred to anxiety; but this time she
13791: addressed herself to her brother, going to the warehouse expressly to
13792: avoid Mrs. Vincy’s volatility. His replies were not satisfactory.
13793: 
13794: “Walter, you never mean to tell me that you have allowed all this to go
13795: on without inquiry into Mr. Lydgate’s prospects?” said Mrs. Bulstrode,
13796: opening her eyes with wider gravity at her brother, who was in his
13797: peevish warehouse humor. “Think of this girl brought up in luxury—in
13798: too worldly a way, I am sorry to say—what will she do on a small
13799: income?”
13800: 
13801: “Oh, confound it, Harriet! What can I do when men come into the town
13802: without any asking of mine? Did you shut your house up against Lydgate?
13803: Bulstrode has pushed him forward more than anybody. I never made any
13804: fuss about the young fellow. You should go and talk to your husband
13805: about it, not me.”
13806: 
13807: “Well, really, Walter, how can Mr. Bulstrode be to blame? I am sure he
13808: did not wish for the engagement.”
13809: 
13810: “Oh, if Bulstrode had not taken him by the hand, I should never have
13811: invited him.”
13812: 
13813: “But you called him in to attend on Fred, and I am sure that was a
13814: mercy,” said Mrs. Bulstrode, losing her clew in the intricacies of the
13815: subject.
13816: 
13817: “I don’t know about mercy,” said Mr. Vincy, testily. “I know I am
13818: worried more than I like with my family. I was a good brother to you,
13819: Harriet, before you married Bulstrode, and I must say he doesn’t always
13820: show that friendly spirit towards your family that might have been
13821: expected of him.” Mr. Vincy was very little like a Jesuit, but no
13822: accomplished Jesuit could have turned a question more adroitly. Harriet
13823: had to defend her husband instead of blaming her brother, and the
13824: conversation ended at a point as far from the beginning as some recent
13825: sparring between the brothers-in-law at a vestry meeting.
13826: 
13827: Mrs. Bulstrode did not repeat her brother’s complaints to her husband,
13828: but in the evening she spoke to him of Lydgate and Rosamond. He did not
13829: share her warm interest, however; and only spoke with resignation of
13830: the risks attendant on the beginning of medical practice and the
13831: desirability of prudence.
13832: 
13833: “I am sure we are bound to pray for that thoughtless girl—brought up as
13834: she has been,” said Mrs. Bulstrode, wishing to rouse her husband’s
13835: feelings.
13836: 
13837: “Truly, my dear,” said Mr. Bulstrode, assentingly. “Those who are not
13838: of this world can do little else to arrest the errors of the
13839: obstinately worldly. That is what we must accustom ourselves to
13840: recognize with regard to your brother’s family. I could have wished
13841: that Mr. Lydgate had not entered into such a union; but my relations
13842: with him are limited to that use of his gifts for God’s purposes which
13843: is taught us by the divine government under each dispensation.”
13844: 
13845: Mrs. Bulstrode said no more, attributing some dissatisfaction which she
13846: felt to her own want of spirituality. She believed that her husband was
13847: one of those men whose memoirs should be written when they died.
13848: 
13849: As to Lydgate himself, having been accepted, he was prepared to accept
13850: all the consequences which he believed himself to foresee with perfect
13851: clearness. Of course he must be married in a year—perhaps even in half
13852: a year. This was not what he had intended; but other schemes would not
13853: be hindered: they would simply adjust themselves anew. Marriage, of
13854: course, must be prepared for in the usual way. A house must be taken
13855: instead of the rooms he at present occupied; and Lydgate, having heard
13856: Rosamond speak with admiration of old Mrs. Bretton’s house (situated in
13857: Lowick Gate), took notice when it fell vacant after the old lady’s
13858: death, and immediately entered into treaty for it.
13859: 
13860: He did this in an episodic way, very much as he gave orders to his
13861: tailor for every requisite of perfect dress, without any notion of
13862: being extravagant. On the contrary, he would have despised any
13863: ostentation of expense; his profession had familiarized him with all
13864: grades of poverty, and he cared much for those who suffered hardships.
13865: He would have behaved perfectly at a table where the sauce was served
13866: in a jug with the handle off, and he would have remembered nothing
13867: about a grand dinner except that a man was there who talked well. But
13868: it had never occurred to him that he should live in any other than what
13869: he would have called an ordinary way, with green glasses for hock, and
13870: excellent waiting at table. In warming himself at French social
13871: theories he had brought away no smell of scorching. We may handle even
13872: extreme opinions with impunity while our furniture, our dinner-giving,
13873: and preference for armorial bearings in our own case, link us
13874: indissolubly with the established order. And Lydgate’s tendency was not
13875: towards extreme opinions: he would have liked no barefooted doctrines,
13876: being particular about his boots: he was no radical in relation to
13877: anything but medical reform and the prosecution of discovery. In the
13878: rest of practical life he walked by hereditary habit; half from that
13879: personal pride and unreflecting egoism which I have already called
13880: commonness, and half from that naivete which belonged to preoccupation
13881: with favorite ideas.
13882: 
13883: Any inward debate Lydgate had as to the consequences of this engagement
13884: which had stolen upon him, turned on the paucity of time rather than of
13885: money. Certainly, being in love and being expected continually by some
13886: one who always turned out to be prettier than memory could represent
13887: her to be, did interfere with the diligent use of spare hours which
13888: might serve some “plodding fellow of a German” to make the great,
13889: imminent discovery. This was really an argument for not deferring the
13890: marriage too long, as he implied to Mr. Farebrother, one day that the
13891: Vicar came to his room with some pond-products which he wanted to
13892: examine under a better microscope than his own, and, finding Lydgate’s
13893: tableful of apparatus and specimens in confusion, said sarcastically—
13894: 
13895: “Eros has degenerated; he began by introducing order and harmony, and
13896: now he brings back chaos.”
13897: 
13898: “Yes, at some stages,” said Lydgate, lifting his brows and smiling,
13899: while he began to arrange his microscope. “But a better order will
13900: begin after.”
13901: 
13902: “Soon?” said the Vicar.
13903: 
13904: “I hope so, really. This unsettled state of affairs uses up the time,
13905: and when one has notions in science, every moment is an opportunity. I
13906: feel sure that marriage must be the best thing for a man who wants to
13907: work steadily. He has everything at home then—no teasing with personal
13908: speculations—he can get calmness and freedom.”
13909: 
13910: “You are an enviable dog,” said the Vicar, “to have such a
13911: prospect—Rosamond, calmness and freedom, all to your share. Here am I
13912: with nothing but my pipe and pond-animalcules. Now, are you ready?”
13913: 
13914: Lydgate did not mention to the Vicar another reason he had for wishing
13915: to shorten the period of courtship. It was rather irritating to him,
13916: even with the wine of love in his veins, to be obliged to mingle so
13917: often with the family party at the Vincys’, and to enter so much into
13918: Middlemarch gossip, protracted good cheer, whist-playing, and general
13919: futility. He had to be deferential when Mr. Vincy decided questions
13920: with trenchant ignorance, especially as to those liquors which were the
13921: best inward pickle, preserving you from the effects of bad air. Mrs.
13922: Vincy’s openness and simplicity were quite unstreaked with suspicion as
13923: to the subtle offence she might give to the taste of her intended
13924: son-in-law; and altogether Lydgate had to confess to himself that he
13925: was descending a little in relation to Rosamond’s family. But that
13926: exquisite creature herself suffered in the same sort of way:—it was at
13927: least one delightful thought that in marrying her, he could give her a
13928: much-needed transplantation.
13929: 
13930: “Dear!” he said to her one evening, in his gentlest tone, as he sat
13931: down by her and looked closely at her face—
13932: 
13933: But I must first say that he had found her alone in the drawing-room,
13934: where the great old-fashioned window, almost as large as the side of
13935: the room, was opened to the summer scents of the garden at the back of
13936: the house. Her father and mother were gone to a party, and the rest
13937: were all out with the butterflies.
13938: 
13939: “Dear! your eyelids are red.”
13940: 
13941: “Are they?” said Rosamond. “I wonder why.” It was not in her nature to
13942: pour forth wishes or grievances. They only came forth gracefully on
13943: solicitation.
13944: 
13945: “As if you could hide it from me!” said Lydgate, laying his hand
13946: tenderly on both of hers. “Don’t I see a tiny drop on one of the
13947: lashes? Things trouble you, and you don’t tell me. That is unloving.”
13948: 
13949: “Why should I tell you what you cannot alter? They are every-day
13950: things:—perhaps they have been a little worse lately.”
13951: 
13952: “Family annoyances. Don’t fear speaking. I guess them.”
13953: 
13954: “Papa has been more irritable lately. Fred makes him angry, and this
13955: morning there was a fresh quarrel because Fred threatens to throw his
13956: whole education away, and do something quite beneath him. And besides—”
13957: 
13958: Rosamond hesitated, and her cheeks were gathering a slight flush.
13959: Lydgate had never seen her in trouble since the morning of their
13960: engagement, and he had never felt so passionately towards her as at
13961: this moment. He kissed the hesitating lips gently, as if to encourage
13962: them.
13963: 
13964: “I feel that papa is not quite pleased about our engagement,” Rosamond
13965: continued, almost in a whisper; “and he said last night that he should
13966: certainly speak to you and say it must be given up.”
13967: 
13968: “Will you give it up?” said Lydgate, with quick energy—almost angrily.
13969: 
13970: “I never give up anything that I choose to do,” said Rosamond,
13971: recovering her calmness at the touching of this chord.
13972: 
13973: “God bless you!” said Lydgate, kissing her again. This constancy of
13974: purpose in the right place was adorable. He went on:—
13975: 
13976: “It is too late now for your father to say that our engagement must be
13977: given up. You are of age, and I claim you as mine. If anything is done
13978: to make you unhappy,—that is a reason for hastening our marriage.”
13979: 
13980: An unmistakable delight shone forth from the blue eyes that met his,
13981: and the radiance seemed to light up all his future with mild sunshine.
13982: Ideal happiness (of the kind known in the Arabian Nights, in which you
13983: are invited to step from the labor and discord of the street into a
13984: paradise where everything is given to you and nothing claimed) seemed
13985: to be an affair of a few weeks’ waiting, more or less.
13986: 
13987: “Why should we defer it?” he said, with ardent insistence. “I have
13988: taken the house now: everything else can soon be got ready—can it not?
13989: You will not mind about new clothes. Those can be bought afterwards.”
13990: 
13991: “What original notions you clever men have!” said Rosamond, dimpling
13992: with more thorough laughter than usual at this humorous incongruity.
13993: “This is the first time I ever heard of wedding-clothes being bought
13994: after marriage.”
13995: 
13996: “But you don’t mean to say you would insist on my waiting months for
13997: the sake of clothes?” said Lydgate, half thinking that Rosamond was
13998: tormenting him prettily, and half fearing that she really shrank from
13999: speedy marriage. “Remember, we are looking forward to a better sort of
14000: happiness even than this—being continually together, independent of
14001: others, and ordering our lives as we will. Come, dear, tell me how soon
14002: you can be altogether mine.”
14003: 
14004: There was a serious pleading in Lydgate’s tone, as if he felt that she
14005: would be injuring him by any fantastic delays. Rosamond became serious
14006: too, and slightly meditative; in fact, she was going through many
14007: intricacies of lace-edging and hosiery and petticoat-tucking, in order
14008: to give an answer that would at least be approximative.
14009: 
14010: “Six weeks would be ample—say so, Rosamond,” insisted Lydgate,
14011: releasing her hands to put his arm gently round her.
14012: 
14013: One little hand immediately went to pat her hair, while she gave her
14014: neck a meditative turn, and then said seriously—
14015: 
14016: “There would be the house-linen and the furniture to be prepared.
14017: Still, mamma could see to those while we were away.”
14018: 
14019: “Yes, to be sure. We must be away a week or so.”
14020: 
14021: “Oh, more than that!” said Rosamond, earnestly. She was thinking of her
14022: evening dresses for the visit to Sir Godwin Lydgate’s, which she had
14023: long been secretly hoping for as a delightful employment of at least
14024: one quarter of the honeymoon, even if she deferred her introduction to
14025: the uncle who was a doctor of divinity (also a pleasing though sober
14026: kind of rank, when sustained by blood). She looked at her lover with
14027: some wondering remonstrance as she spoke, and he readily understood
14028: that she might wish to lengthen the sweet time of double solitude.
14029: 
14030: “Whatever you wish, my darling, when the day is fixed. But let us take
14031: a decided course, and put an end to any discomfort you may be
14032: suffering. Six weeks!—I am sure they would be ample.”
14033: 
14034: “I could certainly hasten the work,” said Rosamond. “Will you, then,
14035: mention it to papa?—I think it would be better to write to him.” She
14036: blushed and looked at him as the garden flowers look at us when we walk
14037: forth happily among them in the transcendent evening light: is there
14038: not a soul beyond utterance, half nymph, half child, in those delicate
14039: petals which glow and breathe about the centres of deep color?
14040: 
14041: He touched her ear and a little bit of neck under it with his lips, and
14042: they sat quite still for many minutes which flowed by them like a small
14043: gurgling brook with the kisses of the sun upon it. Rosamond thought
14044: that no one could be more in love than she was; and Lydgate thought
14045: that after all his wild mistakes and absurd credulity, he had found
14046: perfect womanhood—felt as if already breathed upon by exquisite wedded
14047: affection such as would be bestowed by an accomplished creature who
14048: venerated his high musings and momentous labors and would never
14049: interfere with them; who would create order in the home and accounts
14050: with still magic, yet keep her fingers ready to touch the lute and
14051: transform life into romance at any moment; who was instructed to the
14052: true womanly limit and not a hair’s-breadth beyond—docile, therefore,
14053: and ready to carry out behests which came from that limit. It was
14054: plainer now than ever that his notion of remaining much longer a
14055: bachelor had been a mistake: marriage would not be an obstruction but a
14056: furtherance. And happening the next day to accompany a patient to
14057: Brassing, he saw a dinner-service there which struck him as so exactly
14058: the right thing that he bought it at once. It saved time to do these
14059: things just when you thought of them, and Lydgate hated ugly crockery.
14060: The dinner-service in question was expensive, but that might be in the
14061: nature of dinner-services. Furnishing was necessarily expensive; but
14062: then it had to be done only once.
14063: 
14064: “It must be lovely,” said Mrs. Vincy, when Lydgate mentioned his
14065: purchase with some descriptive touches. “Just what Rosy ought to have.
14066: I trust in heaven it won’t be broken!”
14067: 
14068: “One must hire servants who will not break things,” said Lydgate.
14069: (Certainly, this was reasoning with an imperfect vision of sequences.
14070: But at that period there was no sort of reasoning which was not more or
14071: less sanctioned by men of science.)
14072: 
14073: Of course it was unnecessary to defer the mention of anything to mamma,
14074: who did not readily take views that were not cheerful, and being a
14075: happy wife herself, had hardly any feeling but pride in her daughter’s
14076: marriage. But Rosamond had good reasons for suggesting to Lydgate that
14077: papa should be appealed to in writing. She prepared for the arrival of
14078: the letter by walking with her papa to the warehouse the next morning,
14079: and telling him on the way that Mr. Lydgate wished to be married soon.
14080: 
14081: “Nonsense, my dear!” said Mr. Vincy. “What has he got to marry on?
14082: You’d much better give up the engagement. I’ve told you so pretty
14083: plainly before this. What have you had such an education for, if you
14084: are to go and marry a poor man? It’s a cruel thing for a father to
14085: see.”
14086: 
14087: “Mr. Lydgate is not poor, papa. He bought Mr. Peacock’s practice,
14088: which, they say, is worth eight or nine hundred a-year.”
14089: 
14090: “Stuff and nonsense! What’s buying a practice? He might as well buy
14091: next year’s swallows. It’ll all slip through his fingers.”
14092: 
14093: “On the contrary, papa, he will increase the practice. See how he has
14094: been called in by the Chettams and Casaubons.”
14095: 
14096: “I hope he knows I shan’t give anything—with this disappointment about
14097: Fred, and Parliament going to be dissolved, and machine-breaking
14098: everywhere, and an election coming on—”
14099: 
14100: “Dear papa! what can that have to do with my marriage?”
14101: 
14102: “A pretty deal to do with it! We may all be ruined for what I know—the
14103: country’s in that state! Some say it’s the end of the world, and be
14104: hanged if I don’t think it looks like it! Anyhow, it’s not a time for
14105: me to be drawing money out of my business, and I should wish Lydgate to
14106: know that.”
14107: 
14108: “I am sure he expects nothing, papa. And he has such very high
14109: connections: he is sure to rise in one way or another. He is engaged in
14110: making scientific discoveries.”
14111: 
14112: Mr. Vincy was silent.
14113: 
14114: “I cannot give up my only prospect of happiness, papa. Mr. Lydgate is a
14115: gentleman. I could never love any one who was not a perfect gentleman.
14116: You would not like me to go into a consumption, as Arabella Hawley did.
14117: And you know that I never change my mind.”
14118: 
14119: Again papa was silent.
14120: 
14121: “Promise me, papa, that you will consent to what we wish. We shall
14122: never give each other up; and you know that you have always objected to
14123: long courtships and late marriages.”
14124: 
14125: There was a little more urgency of this kind, till Mr. Vincy said,
14126: “Well, well, child, he must write to me first before I can answer
14127: him,”—and Rosamond was certain that she had gained her point.
14128: 
14129: Mr. Vincy’s answer consisted chiefly in a demand that Lydgate should
14130: insure his life—a demand immediately conceded. This was a delightfully
14131: reassuring idea supposing that Lydgate died, but in the mean time not a
14132: self-supporting idea. However, it seemed to make everything comfortable
14133: about Rosamond’s marriage; and the necessary purchases went on with
14134: much spirit. Not without prudential considerations, however. A bride
14135: (who is going to visit at a baronet’s) must have a few first-rate
14136: pocket-handkerchiefs; but beyond the absolutely necessary half-dozen,
14137: Rosamond contented herself without the very highest style of embroidery
14138: and Valenciennes. Lydgate also, finding that his sum of eight hundred
14139: pounds had been considerably reduced since he had come to Middlemarch,
14140: restrained his inclination for some plate of an old pattern which was
14141: shown to him when he went into Kibble’s establishment at Brassing to
14142: buy forks and spoons. He was too proud to act as if he presupposed that
14143: Mr. Vincy would advance money to provide furniture; and though, since
14144: it would not be necessary to pay for everything at once, some bills
14145: would be left standing over, he did not waste time in conjecturing how
14146: much his father-in-law would give in the form of dowry, to make payment
14147: easy. He was not going to do anything extravagant, but the requisite
14148: things must be bought, and it would be bad economy to buy them of a
14149: poor quality. All these matters were by the bye. Lydgate foresaw that
14150: science and his profession were the objects he should alone pursue
14151: enthusiastically; but he could not imagine himself pursuing them in
14152: such a home as Wrench had—the doors all open, the oil-cloth worn, the
14153: children in soiled pinafores, and lunch lingering in the form of bones,
14154: black-handled knives, and willow-pattern. But Wrench had a wretched
14155: lymphatic wife who made a mummy of herself indoors in a large shawl;
14156: and he must have altogether begun with an ill-chosen domestic
14157: apparatus.
14158: 
14159: Rosamond, however, was on her side much occupied with conjectures,
14160: though her quick imitative perception warned her against betraying them
14161: too crudely.
14162: 
14163: “I shall like so much to know your family,” she said one day, when the
14164: wedding journey was being discussed. “We might perhaps take a direction
14165: that would allow us to see them as we returned. Which of your uncles do
14166: you like best?”
14167: 
14168: “Oh,—my uncle Godwin, I think. He is a good-natured old fellow.”
14169: 
14170: “You were constantly at his house at Quallingham, when you were a boy,
14171: were you not? I should so like to see the old spot and everything you
14172: were used to. Does he know you are going to be married?”
14173: 
14174: “No,” said Lydgate, carelessly, turning in his chair and rubbing his
14175: hair up.
14176: 
14177: “Do send him word of it, you naughty undutiful nephew. He will perhaps
14178: ask you to take me to Quallingham; and then you could show me about the
14179: grounds, and I could imagine you there when you were a boy. Remember,
14180: you see me in my home, just as it has been since I was a child. It is
14181: not fair that I should be so ignorant of yours. But perhaps you would
14182: be a little ashamed of me. I forgot that.”
14183: 
14184: Lydgate smiled at her tenderly, and really accepted the suggestion that
14185: the proud pleasure of showing so charming a bride was worth some
14186: trouble. And now he came to think of it, he would like to see the old
14187: spots with Rosamond.
14188: 
14189: “I will write to him, then. But my cousins are bores.”
14190: 
14191: It seemed magnificent to Rosamond to be able to speak so slightingly of
14192: a baronet’s family, and she felt much contentment in the prospect of
14193: being able to estimate them contemptuously on her own account.
14194: 
14195: But mamma was near spoiling all, a day or two later, by saying—
14196: 
14197: “I hope your uncle Sir Godwin will not look down on Rosy, Mr. Lydgate.
14198: I should think he would do something handsome. A thousand or two can be
14199: nothing to a baronet.”
14200: 
14201: “Mamma!” said Rosamond, blushing deeply; and Lydgate pitied her so much
14202: that he remained silent and went to the other end of the room to
14203: examine a print curiously, as if he had been absent-minded. Mamma had a
14204: little filial lecture afterwards, and was docile as usual. But Rosamond
14205: reflected that if any of those high-bred cousins who were bores, should
14206: be induced to visit Middlemarch, they would see many things in her own
14207: family which might shock them. Hence it seemed desirable that Lydgate
14208: should by-and-by get some first-rate position elsewhere than in
14209: Middlemarch; and this could hardly be difficult in the case of a man
14210: who had a titled uncle and could make discoveries. Lydgate, you
14211: perceive, had talked fervidly to Rosamond of his hopes as to the
14212: highest uses of his life, and had found it delightful to be listened to
14213: by a creature who would bring him the sweet furtherance of satisfying
14214: affection—beauty—repose—such help as our thoughts get from the summer
14215: sky and the flower-fringed meadows.
14216: 
14217: Lydgate relied much on the psychological difference between what for
14218: the sake of variety I will call goose and gander: especially on the
14219: innate submissiveness of the goose as beautifully corresponding to the
14220: strength of the gander.

14224: 
14225: CHAPTER XXXVII.
14226: 
14227: Thrice happy she that is so well assured
14228: Unto herself and settled so in heart
14229: That neither will for better be allured
14230: Ne fears to worse with any chance to start,
14231: But like a steddy ship doth strongly part
14232: The raging waves and keeps her course aright;
14233: Ne aught for tempest doth from it depart,
14234: Ne aught for fairer weather’s false delight.
14235: Such self-assurance need not fear the spight
14236: Of grudging foes; ne favour seek of friends;
14237: But in the stay of her own stedfast might
14238: Neither to one herself nor other bends.
14239:     Most happy she that most assured doth rest,
14240:     But he most happy who such one loves best.
14241: —SPENSER.
14242: 
14243: 
14244: The doubt hinted by Mr. Vincy whether it were only the general election
14245: or the end of the world that was coming on, now that George the Fourth
14246: was dead, Parliament dissolved, Wellington and Peel generally
14247: depreciated and the new King apologetic, was a feeble type of the
14248: uncertainties in provincial opinion at that time. With the glow-worm
14249: lights of country places, how could men see which were their own
14250: thoughts in the confusion of a Tory Ministry passing Liberal measures,
14251: of Tory nobles and electors being anxious to return Liberals rather
14252: than friends of the recreant Ministers, and of outcries for remedies
14253: which seemed to have a mysteriously remote bearing on private interest,
14254: and were made suspicious by the advocacy of disagreeable neighbors?
14255: Buyers of the Middlemarch newspapers found themselves in an anomalous
14256: position: during the agitation on the Catholic Question many had given
14257: up the “Pioneer”—which had a motto from Charles James Fox and was in
14258: the van of progress—because it had taken Peel’s side about the Papists,
14259: and had thus blotted its Liberalism with a toleration of Jesuitry and
14260: Baal; but they were ill-satisfied with the “Trumpet,” which—since its
14261: blasts against Rome, and in the general flaccidity of the public mind
14262: (nobody knowing who would support whom)—had become feeble in its
14263: blowing.
14264: 
14265: It was a time, according to a noticeable article in the “Pioneer,” when
14266: the crying needs of the country might well counteract a reluctance to
14267: public action on the part of men whose minds had from long experience
14268: acquired breadth as well as concentration, decision of judgment as well
14269: as tolerance, dispassionateness as well as energy—in fact, all those
14270: qualities which in the melancholy experience of mankind have been the
14271: least disposed to share lodgings.
14272: 
14273: Mr. Hackbutt, whose fluent speech was at that time floating more widely
14274: than usual, and leaving much uncertainty as to its ultimate channel,
14275: was heard to say in Mr. Hawley’s office that the article in question
14276: “emanated” from Brooke of Tipton, and that Brooke had secretly bought
14277: the “Pioneer” some months ago.
14278: 
14279: “That means mischief, eh?” said Mr. Hawley. “He’s got the freak of
14280: being a popular man now, after dangling about like a stray tortoise. So
14281: much the worse for him. I’ve had my eye on him for some time. He shall
14282: be prettily pumped upon. He’s a damned bad landlord. What business has
14283: an old county man to come currying favor with a low set of dark-blue
14284: freemen? As to his paper, I only hope he may do the writing himself. It
14285: would be worth our paying for.”
14286: 
14287: “I understand he has got a very brilliant young fellow to edit it, who
14288: can write the highest style of leading article, quite equal to anything
14289: in the London papers. And he means to take very high ground on Reform.”
14290: 
14291: “Let Brooke reform his rent-roll. He’s a cursed old screw, and the
14292: buildings all over his estate are going to rack. I suppose this young
14293: fellow is some loose fish from London.”
14294: 
14295: “His name is Ladislaw. He is said to be of foreign extraction.”
14296: 
14297: “I know the sort,” said Mr. Hawley; “some emissary. He’ll begin with
14298: flourishing about the Rights of Man and end with murdering a wench.
14299: That’s the style.”
14300: 
14301: “You must concede that there are abuses, Hawley,” said Mr. Hackbutt,
14302: foreseeing some political disagreement with his family lawyer. “I
14303: myself should never favor immoderate views—in fact I take my stand with
14304: Huskisson—but I cannot blind myself to the consideration that the
14305: non-representation of large towns—”
14306: 
14307: “Large towns be damned!” said Mr. Hawley, impatient of exposition. “I
14308: know a little too much about Middlemarch elections. Let ’em quash every
14309: pocket borough to-morrow, and bring in every mushroom town in the
14310: kingdom—they’ll only increase the expense of getting into Parliament. I
14311: go upon facts.”
14312: 
14313: Mr. Hawley’s disgust at the notion of the “Pioneer” being edited by an
14314: emissary, and of Brooke becoming actively political—as if a tortoise of
14315: desultory pursuits should protrude its small head ambitiously and
14316: become rampant—was hardly equal to the annoyance felt by some members
14317: of Mr. Brooke’s own family. The result had oozed forth gradually, like
14318: the discovery that your neighbor has set up an unpleasant kind of
14319: manufacture which will be permanently under your nostrils without legal
14320: remedy. The “Pioneer” had been secretly bought even before Will
14321: Ladislaw’s arrival, the expected opportunity having offered itself in
14322: the readiness of the proprietor to part with a valuable property which
14323: did not pay; and in the interval since Mr. Brooke had written his
14324: invitation, those germinal ideas of making his mind tell upon the world
14325: at large which had been present in him from his younger years, but had
14326: hitherto lain in some obstruction, had been sprouting under cover.
14327: 
14328: The development was much furthered by a delight in his guest which
14329: proved greater even than he had anticipated. For it seemed that Will
14330: was not only at home in all those artistic and literary subjects which
14331: Mr. Brooke had gone into at one time, but that he was strikingly ready
14332: at seizing the points of the political situation, and dealing with them
14333: in that large spirit which, aided by adequate memory, lends itself to
14334: quotation and general effectiveness of treatment.
14335: 
14336: “He seems to me a kind of Shelley, you know,” Mr. Brooke took an
14337: opportunity of saying, for the gratification of Mr. Casaubon. “I don’t
14338: mean as to anything objectionable—laxities or atheism, or anything of
14339: that kind, you know—Ladislaw’s sentiments in every way I am sure are
14340: good—indeed, we were talking a great deal together last night. But he
14341: has the same sort of enthusiasm for liberty, freedom, emancipation—a
14342: fine thing under guidance—under guidance, you know. I think I shall be
14343: able to put him on the right tack; and I am the more pleased because he
14344: is a relation of yours, Casaubon.”
14345: 
14346: If the right tack implied anything more precise than the rest of Mr.
14347: Brooke’s speech, Mr. Casaubon silently hoped that it referred to some
14348: occupation at a great distance from Lowick. He had disliked Will while
14349: he helped him, but he had begun to dislike him still more now that Will
14350: had declined his help. That is the way with us when we have any uneasy
14351: jealousy in our disposition: if our talents are chiefly of the
14352: burrowing kind, our honey-sipping cousin (whom we have grave reasons
14353: for objecting to) is likely to have a secret contempt for us, and any
14354: one who admires him passes an oblique criticism on ourselves. Having
14355: the scruples of rectitude in our souls, we are above the meanness of
14356: injuring him—rather we meet all his claims on us by active benefits;
14357: and the drawing of cheques for him, being a superiority which he must
14358: recognize, gives our bitterness a milder infusion. Now Mr. Casaubon had
14359: been deprived of that superiority (as anything more than a remembrance)
14360: in a sudden, capricious manner. His antipathy to Will did not spring
14361: from the common jealousy of a winter-worn husband: it was something
14362: deeper, bred by his lifelong claims and discontents; but Dorothea, now
14363: that she was present—Dorothea, as a young wife who herself had shown an
14364: offensive capability of criticism, necessarily gave concentration to
14365: the uneasiness which had before been vague.
14366: 
14367: Will Ladislaw on his side felt that his dislike was flourishing at the
14368: expense of his gratitude, and spent much inward discourse in justifying
14369: the dislike. Casaubon hated him—he knew that very well; on his first
14370: entrance he could discern a bitterness in the mouth and a venom in the
14371: glance which would almost justify declaring war in spite of past
14372: benefits. He was much obliged to Casaubon in the past, but really the
14373: act of marrying this wife was a set-off against the obligation. It was
14374: a question whether gratitude which refers to what is done for one’s
14375: self ought not to give way to indignation at what is done against
14376: another. And Casaubon had done a wrong to Dorothea in marrying her. A
14377: man was bound to know himself better than that, and if he chose to grow
14378: gray crunching bones in a cavern, he had no business to be luring a
14379: girl into his companionship. “It is the most horrible of
14380: virgin-sacrifices,” said Will; and he painted to himself what were
14381: Dorothea’s inward sorrows as if he had been writing a choric wail. But
14382: he would never lose sight of her: he would watch over her—if he gave up
14383: everything else in life he would watch over her, and she should know
14384: that she had one slave in the world. Will had—to use Sir Thomas
14385: Browne’s phrase—a “passionate prodigality” of statement both to himself
14386: and others. The simple truth was that nothing then invited him so
14387: strongly as the presence of Dorothea.
14388: 
14389: Invitations of the formal kind had been wanting, however, for Will had
14390: never been asked to go to Lowick. Mr. Brooke, indeed, confident of
14391: doing everything agreeable which Casaubon, poor fellow, was too much
14392: absorbed to think of, had arranged to bring Ladislaw to Lowick several
14393: times (not neglecting meanwhile to introduce him elsewhere on every
14394: opportunity as “a young relative of Casaubon’s”). And though Will had
14395: not seen Dorothea alone, their interviews had been enough to restore
14396: her former sense of young companionship with one who was cleverer than
14397: herself, yet seemed ready to be swayed by her. Poor Dorothea before her
14398: marriage had never found much room in other minds for what she cared
14399: most to say; and she had not, as we know, enjoyed her husband’s
14400: superior instruction so much as she had expected. If she spoke with any
14401: keenness of interest to Mr. Casaubon, he heard her with an air of
14402: patience as if she had given a quotation from the Delectus familiar to
14403: him from his tender years, and sometimes mentioned curtly what ancient
14404: sects or personages had held similar ideas, as if there were too much
14405: of that sort in stock already; at other times he would inform her that
14406: she was mistaken, and reassert what her remark had questioned.
14407: 
14408: But Will Ladislaw always seemed to see more in what she said than she
14409: herself saw. Dorothea had little vanity, but she had the ardent woman’s
14410: need to rule beneficently by making the joy of another soul. Hence the
14411: mere chance of seeing Will occasionally was like a lunette opened in
14412: the wall of her prison, giving her a glimpse of the sunny air; and this
14413: pleasure began to nullify her original alarm at what her husband might
14414: think about the introduction of Will as her uncle’s guest. On this
14415: subject Mr. Casaubon had remained dumb.
14416: 
14417: But Will wanted to talk with Dorothea alone, and was impatient of slow
14418: circumstance. However slight the terrestrial intercourse between Dante
14419: and Beatrice or Petrarch and Laura, time changes the proportion of
14420: things, and in later days it is preferable to have fewer sonnets and
14421: more conversation. Necessity excused stratagem, but stratagem was
14422: limited by the dread of offending Dorothea. He found out at last that
14423: he wanted to take a particular sketch at Lowick; and one morning when
14424: Mr. Brooke had to drive along the Lowick road on his way to the county
14425: town, Will asked to be set down with his sketch-book and camp-stool at
14426: Lowick, and without announcing himself at the Manor settled himself to
14427: sketch in a position where he must see Dorothea if she came out to
14428: walk—and he knew that she usually walked an hour in the morning.
14429: 
14430: But the stratagem was defeated by the weather. Clouds gathered with
14431: treacherous quickness, the rain came down, and Will was obliged to take
14432: shelter in the house. He intended, on the strength of relationship, to
14433: go into the drawing-room and wait there without being announced; and
14434: seeing his old acquaintance the butler in the hall, he said, “Don’t
14435: mention that I am here, Pratt; I will wait till luncheon; I know Mr.
14436: Casaubon does not like to be disturbed when he is in the library.”
14437: 
14438: “Master is out, sir; there’s only Mrs. Casaubon in the library. I’d
14439: better tell her you’re here, sir,” said Pratt, a red-cheeked man given
14440: to lively converse with Tantripp, and often agreeing with her that it
14441: must be dull for Madam.
14442: 
14443: “Oh, very well; this confounded rain has hindered me from sketching,”
14444: said Will, feeling so happy that he affected indifference with
14445: delightful ease.
14446: 
14447: In another minute he was in the library, and Dorothea was meeting him
14448: with her sweet unconstrained smile.
14449: 
14450: “Mr. Casaubon has gone to the Archdeacon’s,” she said, at once. “I
14451: don’t know whether he will be at home again long before dinner. He was
14452: uncertain how long he should be. Did you want to say anything
14453: particular to him?”
14454: 
14455: “No; I came to sketch, but the rain drove me in. Else I would not have
14456: disturbed you yet. I supposed that Mr. Casaubon was here, and I know he
14457: dislikes interruption at this hour.”
14458: 
14459: “I am indebted to the rain, then. I am so glad to see you.” Dorothea
14460: uttered these common words with the simple sincerity of an unhappy
14461: child, visited at school.
14462: 
14463: “I really came for the chance of seeing you alone,” said Will,
14464: mysteriously forced to be just as simple as she was. He could not stay
14465: to ask himself, why not? “I wanted to talk about things, as we did in
14466: Rome. It always makes a difference when other people are present.”
14467: 
14468: “Yes,” said Dorothea, in her clear full tone of assent. “Sit down.” She
14469: seated herself on a dark ottoman with the brown books behind her,
14470: looking in her plain dress of some thin woollen-white material, without
14471: a single ornament on her besides her wedding-ring, as if she were under
14472: a vow to be different from all other women; and Will sat down opposite
14473: her at two yards’ distance, the light falling on his bright curls and
14474: delicate but rather petulant profile, with its defiant curves of lip
14475: and chin. Each looked at the other as if they had been two flowers
14476: which had opened then and there. Dorothea for the moment forgot her
14477: husband’s mysterious irritation against Will: it seemed fresh water at
14478: her thirsty lips to speak without fear to the one person whom she had
14479: found receptive; for in looking backward through sadness she
14480: exaggerated a past solace.
14481: 
14482: “I have often thought that I should like to talk to you again,” she
14483: said, immediately. “It seems strange to me how many things I said to
14484: you.”
14485: 
14486: “I remember them all,” said Will, with the unspeakable content in his
14487: soul of feeling that he was in the presence of a creature worthy to be
14488: perfectly loved. I think his own feelings at that moment were perfect,
14489: for we mortals have our divine moments, when love is satisfied in the
14490: completeness of the beloved object.
14491: 
14492: “I have tried to learn a great deal since we were in Rome,” said
14493: Dorothea. “I can read Latin a little, and I am beginning to understand
14494: just a little Greek. I can help Mr. Casaubon better now. I can find out
14495: references for him and save his eyes in many ways. But it is very
14496: difficult to be learned; it seems as if people were worn out on the way
14497: to great thoughts, and can never enjoy them because they are too
14498: tired.”
14499: 
14500: “If a man has a capacity for great thoughts, he is likely to overtake
14501: them before he is decrepit,” said Will, with irrepressible quickness.
14502: But through certain sensibilities Dorothea was as quick as he, and
14503: seeing her face change, he added, immediately, “But it is quite true
14504: that the best minds have been sometimes overstrained in working out
14505: their ideas.”
14506: 
14507: “You correct me,” said Dorothea. “I expressed myself ill. I should have
14508: said that those who have great thoughts get too much worn in working
14509: them out. I used to feel about that, even when I was a little girl; and
14510: it always seemed to me that the use I should like to make of my life
14511: would be to help some one who did great works, so that his burthen
14512: might be lighter.”
14513: 
14514: Dorothea was led on to this bit of autobiography without any sense of
14515: making a revelation. But she had never before said anything to Will
14516: which threw so strong a light on her marriage. He did not shrug his
14517: shoulders; and for want of that muscular outlet he thought the more
14518: irritably of beautiful lips kissing holy skulls and other emptinesses
14519: ecclesiastically enshrined. Also he had to take care that his speech
14520: should not betray that thought.
14521: 
14522: “But you may easily carry the help too far,” he said, “and get
14523: over-wrought yourself. Are you not too much shut up? You already look
14524: paler. It would be better for Mr. Casaubon to have a secretary; he
14525: could easily get a man who would do half his work for him. It would
14526: save him more effectually, and you need only help him in lighter ways.”
14527: 
14528: “How can you think of that?” said Dorothea, in a tone of earnest
14529: remonstrance. “I should have no happiness if I did not help him in his
14530: work. What could I do? There is no good to be done in Lowick. The only
14531: thing I desire is to help him more. And he objects to a secretary:
14532: please not to mention that again.”
14533: 
14534: “Certainly not, now I know your feeling. But I have heard both Mr.
14535: Brooke and Sir James Chettam express the same wish.”
14536: 
14537: “Yes,” said Dorothea, “but they don’t understand—they want me to be a
14538: great deal on horseback, and have the garden altered and new
14539: conservatories, to fill up my days. I thought you could understand that
14540: one’s mind has other wants,” she added, rather impatiently—“besides,
14541: Mr. Casaubon cannot bear to hear of a secretary.”
14542: 
14543: “My mistake is excusable,” said Will. “In old days I used to hear Mr.
14544: Casaubon speak as if he looked forward to having a secretary. Indeed he
14545: held out the prospect of that office to me. But I turned out to be—not
14546: good enough for it.”
14547: 
14548: Dorothea was trying to extract out of this an excuse for her husband’s
14549: evident repulsion, as she said, with a playful smile, “You were not a
14550: steady worker enough.”
14551: 
14552: “No,” said Will, shaking his head backward somewhat after the manner of
14553: a spirited horse. And then, the old irritable demon prompting him to
14554: give another good pinch at the moth-wings of poor Mr. Casaubon’s glory,
14555: he went on, “And I have seen since that Mr. Casaubon does not like any
14556: one to overlook his work and know thoroughly what he is doing. He is
14557: too doubtful—too uncertain of himself. I may not be good for much, but
14558: he dislikes me because I disagree with him.”
14559: 
14560: Will was not without his intentions to be always generous, but our
14561: tongues are little triggers which have usually been pulled before
14562: general intentions can be brought to bear. And it was too intolerable
14563: that Casaubon’s dislike of him should not be fairly accounted for to
14564: Dorothea. Yet when he had spoken he was rather uneasy as to the effect
14565: on her.
14566: 
14567: But Dorothea was strangely quiet—not immediately indignant, as she had
14568: been on a like occasion in Rome. And the cause lay deep. She was no
14569: longer struggling against the perception of facts, but adjusting
14570: herself to their clearest perception; and now when she looked steadily
14571: at her husband’s failure, still more at his possible consciousness of
14572: failure, she seemed to be looking along the one track where duty became
14573: tenderness. Will’s want of reticence might have been met with more
14574: severity, if he had not already been recommended to her mercy by her
14575: husband’s dislike, which must seem hard to her till she saw better
14576: reason for it.
14577: 
14578: She did not answer at once, but after looking down ruminatingly she
14579: said, with some earnestness, “Mr. Casaubon must have overcome his
14580: dislike of you so far as his actions were concerned: and that is
14581: admirable.”
14582: 
14583: “Yes; he has shown a sense of justice in family matters. It was an
14584: abominable thing that my grandmother should have been disinherited
14585: because she made what they called a _mesalliance_, though there was
14586: nothing to be said against her husband except that he was a Polish
14587: refugee who gave lessons for his bread.”
14588: 
14589: “I wish I knew all about her!” said Dorothea. “I wonder how she bore
14590: the change from wealth to poverty: I wonder whether she was happy with
14591: her husband! Do you know much about them?”
14592: 
14593: “No; only that my grandfather was a patriot—a bright fellow—could speak
14594: many languages—musical—got his bread by teaching all sorts of things.
14595: They both died rather early. And I never knew much of my father, beyond
14596: what my mother told me; but he inherited the musical talents. I
14597: remember his slow walk and his long thin hands; and one day remains
14598: with me when he was lying ill, and I was very hungry, and had only a
14599: little bit of bread.”
14600: 
14601: “Ah, what a different life from mine!” said Dorothea, with keen
14602: interest, clasping her hands on her lap. “I have always had too much of
14603: everything. But tell me how it was—Mr. Casaubon could not have known
14604: about you then.”
14605: 
14606: “No; but my father had made himself known to Mr. Casaubon, and that was
14607: my last hungry day. My father died soon after, and my mother and I were
14608: well taken care of. Mr. Casaubon always expressly recognized it as his
14609: duty to take care of us because of the harsh injustice which had been
14610: shown to his mother’s sister. But now I am telling you what is not new
14611: to you.”
14612: 
14613: In his inmost soul Will was conscious of wishing to tell Dorothea what
14614: was rather new even in his own construction of things—namely, that Mr.
14615: Casaubon had never done more than pay a debt towards him. Will was much
14616: too good a fellow to be easy under the sense of being ungrateful. And
14617: when gratitude has become a matter of reasoning there are many ways of
14618: escaping from its bonds.
14619: 
14620: “No,” answered Dorothea; “Mr. Casaubon has always avoided dwelling on
14621: his own honorable actions.” She did not feel that her husband’s conduct
14622: was depreciated; but this notion of what justice had required in his
14623: relations with Will Ladislaw took strong hold on her mind. After a
14624: moment’s pause, she added, “He had never told me that he supported your
14625: mother. Is she still living?”
14626: 
14627: “No; she died by an accident—a fall—four years ago. It is curious that
14628: my mother, too, ran away from her family, but not for the sake of her
14629: husband. She never would tell me anything about her family, except that
14630: she forsook them to get her own living—went on the stage, in fact. She
14631: was a dark-eyed creature, with crisp ringlets, and never seemed to be
14632: getting old. You see I come of rebellious blood on both sides,” Will
14633: ended, smiling brightly at Dorothea, while she was still looking with
14634: serious intentness before her, like a child seeing a drama for the
14635: first time.
14636: 
14637: But her face, too, broke into a smile as she said, “That is your
14638: apology, I suppose, for having yourself been rather rebellious; I mean,
14639: to Mr. Casaubon’s wishes. You must remember that you have not done what
14640: he thought best for you. And if he dislikes you—you were speaking of
14641: dislike a little while ago—but I should rather say, if he has shown any
14642: painful feelings towards you, you must consider how sensitive he has
14643: become from the wearing effect of study. Perhaps,” she continued,
14644: getting into a pleading tone, “my uncle has not told you how serious
14645: Mr. Casaubon’s illness was. It would be very petty of us who are well
14646: and can bear things, to think much of small offences from those who
14647: carry a weight of trial.”
14648: 
14649: “You teach me better,” said Will. “I will never grumble on that subject
14650: again.” There was a gentleness in his tone which came from the
14651: unutterable contentment of perceiving—what Dorothea was hardly
14652: conscious of—that she was travelling into the remoteness of pure pity
14653: and loyalty towards her husband. Will was ready to adore her pity and
14654: loyalty, if she would associate himself with her in manifesting them.
14655: “I have really sometimes been a perverse fellow,” he went on, “but I
14656: will never again, if I can help it, do or say what you would
14657: disapprove.”
14658: 
14659: “That is very good of you,” said Dorothea, with another open smile. “I
14660: shall have a little kingdom then, where I shall give laws. But you will
14661: soon go away, out of my rule, I imagine. You will soon be tired of
14662: staying at the Grange.”
14663: 
14664: “That is a point I wanted to mention to you—one of the reasons why I
14665: wished to speak to you alone. Mr. Brooke proposes that I should stay in
14666: this neighborhood. He has bought one of the Middlemarch newspapers, and
14667: he wishes me to conduct that, and also to help him in other ways.”
14668: 
14669: “Would not that be a sacrifice of higher prospects for you?” said
14670: Dorothea.
14671: 
14672: “Perhaps; but I have always been blamed for thinking of prospects, and
14673: not settling to anything. And here is something offered to me. If you
14674: would not like me to accept it, I will give it up. Otherwise I would
14675: rather stay in this part of the country than go away. I belong to
14676: nobody anywhere else.”
14677: 
14678: “I should like you to stay very much,” said Dorothea, at once, as
14679: simply and readily as she had spoken at Rome. There was not the shadow
14680: of a reason in her mind at the moment why she should not say so.
14681: 
14682: “Then I _will_ stay,” said Ladislaw, shaking his head backward, rising
14683: and going towards the window, as if to see whether the rain had ceased.
14684: 
14685: But the next moment, Dorothea, according to a habit which was getting
14686: continually stronger, began to reflect that her husband felt
14687: differently from herself, and she colored deeply under the double
14688: embarrassment of having expressed what might be in opposition to her
14689: husband’s feeling, and of having to suggest this opposition to Will.
14690: His face was not turned towards her, and this made it easier to say—
14691: 
14692: “But my opinion is of little consequence on such a subject. I think you
14693: should be guided by Mr. Casaubon. I spoke without thinking of anything
14694: else than my own feeling, which has nothing to do with the real
14695: question. But it now occurs to me—perhaps Mr. Casaubon might see that
14696: the proposal was not wise. Can you not wait now and mention it to him?”
14697: 
14698: “I can’t wait to-day,” said Will, inwardly seared by the possibility
14699: that Mr. Casaubon would enter. “The rain is quite over now. I told Mr.
14700: Brooke not to call for me: I would rather walk the five miles. I shall
14701: strike across Halsell Common, and see the gleams on the wet grass. I
14702: like that.”
14703: 
14704: He approached her to shake hands quite hurriedly, longing but not
14705: daring to say, “Don’t mention the subject to Mr. Casaubon.” No, he
14706: dared not, could not say it. To ask her to be less simple and direct
14707: would be like breathing on the crystal that you want to see the light
14708: through. And there was always the other great dread—of himself becoming
14709: dimmed and forever ray-shorn in her eyes.
14710: 
14711: “I wish you could have stayed,” said Dorothea, with a touch of
14712: mournfulness, as she rose and put out her hand. She also had her
14713: thought which she did not like to express:—Will certainly ought to lose
14714: no time in consulting Mr. Casaubon’s wishes, but for her to urge this
14715: might seem an undue dictation.
14716: 
14717: So they only said “Good-by,” and Will quitted the house, striking
14718: across the fields so as not to run any risk of encountering Mr.
14719: Casaubon’s carriage, which, however, did not appear at the gate until
14720: four o’clock. That was an unpropitious hour for coming home: it was too
14721: early to gain the moral support under ennui of dressing his person for
14722: dinner, and too late to undress his mind of the day’s frivolous
14723: ceremony and affairs, so as to be prepared for a good plunge into the
14724: serious business of study. On such occasions he usually threw into an
14725: easy-chair in the library, and allowed Dorothea to read the London
14726: papers to him, closing his eyes the while. To-day, however, he declined
14727: that relief, observing that he had already had too many public details
14728: urged upon him; but he spoke more cheerfully than usual, when Dorothea
14729: asked about his fatigue, and added with that air of formal effort which
14730: never forsook him even when he spoke without his waistcoat and cravat—
14731: 
14732: “I have had the gratification of meeting my former acquaintance, Dr.
14733: Spanning, to-day, and of being praised by one who is himself a worthy
14734: recipient of praise. He spoke very handsomely of my late tractate on
14735: the Egyptian Mysteries,—using, in fact, terms which it would not become
14736: me to repeat.” In uttering the last clause, Mr. Casaubon leaned over
14737: the elbow of his chair, and swayed his head up and down, apparently as
14738: a muscular outlet instead of that recapitulation which would not have
14739: been becoming.
14740: 
14741: “I am very glad you have had that pleasure,” said Dorothea, delighted
14742: to see her husband less weary than usual at this hour. “Before you came
14743: I had been regretting that you happened to be out to-day.”
14744: 
14745: “Why so, my dear?” said Mr. Casaubon, throwing himself backward again.
14746: 
14747: “Because Mr. Ladislaw has been here; and he has mentioned a proposal of
14748: my uncle’s which I should like to know your opinion of.” Her husband
14749: she felt was really concerned in this question. Even with her ignorance
14750: of the world she had a vague impression that the position offered to
14751: Will was out of keeping with his family connections, and certainly Mr.
14752: Casaubon had a claim to be consulted. He did not speak, but merely
14753: bowed.
14754: 
14755: “Dear uncle, you know, has many projects. It appears that he has bought
14756: one of the Middlemarch newspapers, and he has asked Mr. Ladislaw to
14757: stay in this neighborhood and conduct the paper for him, besides
14758: helping him in other ways.”
14759: 
14760: Dorothea looked at her husband while she spoke, but he had at first
14761: blinked and finally closed his eyes, as if to save them; while his lips
14762: became more tense. “What is your opinion?” she added, rather timidly,
14763: after a slight pause.
14764: 
14765: “Did Mr. Ladislaw come on purpose to ask my opinion?” said Mr.
14766: Casaubon, opening his eyes narrowly with a knife-edged look at
14767: Dorothea. She was really uncomfortable on the point he inquired about,
14768: but she only became a little more serious, and her eyes did not swerve.
14769: 
14770: “No,” she answered immediately, “he did not say that he came to ask
14771: your opinion. But when he mentioned the proposal, he of course expected
14772: me to tell you of it.”
14773: 
14774: Mr. Casaubon was silent.
14775: 
14776: “I feared that you might feel some objection. But certainly a young man
14777: with so much talent might be very useful to my uncle—might help him to
14778: do good in a better way. And Mr. Ladislaw wishes to have some fixed
14779: occupation. He has been blamed, he says, for not seeking something of
14780: that kind, and he would like to stay in this neighborhood because no
14781: one cares for him elsewhere.”
14782: 
14783: Dorothea felt that this was a consideration to soften her husband.
14784: However, he did not speak, and she presently recurred to Dr. Spanning
14785: and the Archdeacon’s breakfast. But there was no longer sunshine on
14786: these subjects.
14787: 
14788: The next morning, without Dorothea’s knowledge, Mr. Casaubon despatched
14789: the following letter, beginning “Dear Mr. Ladislaw” (he had always
14790: before addressed him as “Will”):—
14791: 
14792: “Mrs. Casaubon informs me that a proposal has been made to you, and
14793: (according to an inference by no means stretched) has on your part been
14794: in some degree entertained, which involves your residence in this
14795: neighborhood in a capacity which I am justified in saying touches my
14796: own position in such a way as renders it not only natural and
14797: warrantable in me when that effect is viewed under the influence of
14798: legitimate feeling, but incumbent on me when the same effect is
14799: considered in the light of my responsibilities, to state at once that
14800: your acceptance of the proposal above indicated would be highly
14801: offensive to me. That I have some claim to the exercise of a veto here,
14802: would not, I believe, be denied by any reasonable person cognizant of
14803: the relations between us: relations which, though thrown into the past
14804: by your recent procedure, are not thereby annulled in their character
14805: of determining antecedents. I will not here make reflections on any
14806: person’s judgment. It is enough for me to point out to yourself that
14807: there are certain social fitnesses and proprieties which should hinder
14808: a somewhat near relative of mine from becoming any wise conspicuous in
14809: this vicinity in a status not only much beneath my own, but associated
14810: at best with the sciolism of literary or political adventurers. At any
14811: rate, the contrary issue must exclude you from further reception at my
14812: house.
14813: 
14814: 
14815: Yours faithfully,
14816: “EDWARD CASAUBON.”
14817: 
14818: 
14819: Meanwhile Dorothea’s mind was innocently at work towards the further
14820: embitterment of her husband; dwelling, with a sympathy that grew to
14821: agitation, on what Will had told her about his parents and
14822: grandparents. Any private hours in her day were usually spent in her
14823: blue-green boudoir, and she had come to be very fond of its pallid
14824: quaintness. Nothing had been outwardly altered there; but while the
14825: summer had gradually advanced over the western fields beyond the avenue
14826: of elms, the bare room had gathered within it those memories of an
14827: inward life which fill the air as with a cloud of good or bad angels,
14828: the invisible yet active forms of our spiritual triumphs or our
14829: spiritual falls. She had been so used to struggle for and to find
14830: resolve in looking along the avenue towards the arch of western light
14831: that the vision itself had gained a communicating power. Even the pale
14832: stag seemed to have reminding glances and to mean mutely, “Yes, we
14833: know.” And the group of delicately touched miniatures had made an
14834: audience as of beings no longer disturbed about their own earthly lot,
14835: but still humanly interested. Especially the mysterious “Aunt Julia”
14836: about whom Dorothea had never found it easy to question her husband.
14837: 
14838: And now, since her conversation with Will, many fresh images had
14839: gathered round that Aunt Julia who was Will’s grandmother; the presence
14840: of that delicate miniature, so like a living face that she knew,
14841: helping to concentrate her feelings. What a wrong, to cut off the girl
14842: from the family protection and inheritance only because she had chosen
14843: a man who was poor! Dorothea, early troubling her elders with questions
14844: about the facts around her, had wrought herself into some independent
14845: clearness as to the historical, political reasons why eldest sons had
14846: superior rights, and why land should be entailed: those reasons,
14847: impressing her with a certain awe, might be weightier than she knew,
14848: but here was a question of ties which left them uninfringed. Here was a
14849: daughter whose child—even according to the ordinary aping of
14850: aristocratic institutions by people who are no more aristocratic than
14851: retired grocers, and who have no more land to “keep together” than a
14852: lawn and a paddock—would have a prior claim. Was inheritance a question
14853: of liking or of responsibility? All the energy of Dorothea’s nature
14854: went on the side of responsibility—the fulfilment of claims founded on
14855: our own deeds, such as marriage and parentage.
14856: 
14857: It was true, she said to herself, that Mr. Casaubon had a debt to the
14858: Ladislaws—that he had to pay back what the Ladislaws had been wronged
14859: of. And now she began to think of her husband’s will, which had been
14860: made at the time of their marriage, leaving the bulk of his property to
14861: her, with proviso in case of her having children. That ought to be
14862: altered; and no time ought to be lost. This very question which had
14863: just arisen about Will Ladislaw’s occupation, was the occasion for
14864: placing things on a new, right footing. Her husband, she felt sure,
14865: according to all his previous conduct, would be ready to take the just
14866: view, if she proposed it—she, in whose interest an unfair concentration
14867: of the property had been urged. His sense of right had surmounted and
14868: would continue to surmount anything that might be called antipathy. She
14869: suspected that her uncle’s scheme was disapproved by Mr. Casaubon, and
14870: this made it seem all the more opportune that a fresh understanding
14871: should be begun, so that instead of Will’s starting penniless and
14872: accepting the first function that offered itself, he should find
14873: himself in possession of a rightful income which should be paid by her
14874: husband during his life, and, by an immediate alteration of the will,
14875: should be secured at his death. The vision of all this as what ought to
14876: be done seemed to Dorothea like a sudden letting in of daylight, waking
14877: her from her previous stupidity and incurious self-absorbed ignorance
14878: about her husband’s relation to others. Will Ladislaw had refused Mr.
14879: Casaubon’s future aid on a ground that no longer appeared right to her;
14880: and Mr. Casaubon had never himself seen fully what was the claim upon
14881: him. “But he will!” said Dorothea. “The great strength of his character
14882: lies here. And what are we doing with our money? We make no use of half
14883: of our income. My own money buys me nothing but an uneasy conscience.”
14884: 
14885: There was a peculiar fascination for Dorothea in this division of
14886: property intended for herself, and always regarded by her as excessive.
14887: She was blind, you see, to many things obvious to others—likely to
14888: tread in the wrong places, as Celia had warned her; yet her blindness
14889: to whatever did not lie in her own pure purpose carried her safely by
14890: the side of precipices where vision would have been perilous with fear.
14891: 
14892: The thoughts which had gathered vividness in the solitude of her
14893: boudoir occupied her incessantly through the day on which Mr. Casaubon
14894: had sent his letter to Will. Everything seemed hindrance to her till
14895: she could find an opportunity of opening her heart to her husband. To
14896: his preoccupied mind all subjects were to be approached gently, and she
14897: had never since his illness lost from her consciousness the dread of
14898: agitating him. But when young ardor is set brooding over the conception
14899: of a prompt deed, the deed itself seems to start forth with independent
14900: life, mastering ideal obstacles. The day passed in a sombre fashion,
14901: not unusual, though Mr. Casaubon was perhaps unusually silent; but
14902: there were hours of the night which might be counted on as
14903: opportunities of conversation; for Dorothea, when aware of her
14904: husband’s sleeplessness, had established a habit of rising, lighting a
14905: candle, and reading him to sleep again. And this night she was from the
14906: beginning sleepless, excited by resolves. He slept as usual for a few
14907: hours, but she had risen softly and had sat in the darkness for nearly
14908: an hour before he said—
14909: 
14910: “Dorothea, since you are up, will you light a candle?”
14911: 
14912: “Do you feel ill, dear?” was her first question, as she obeyed him.
14913: 
14914: “No, not at all; but I shall be obliged, since you are up, if you will
14915: read me a few pages of Lowth.”
14916: 
14917: “May I talk to you a little instead?” said Dorothea.
14918: 
14919: “Certainly.”
14920: 
14921: “I have been thinking about money all day—that I have always had too
14922: much, and especially the prospect of too much.”
14923: 
14924: “These, my dear Dorothea, are providential arrangements.”
14925: 
14926: “But if one has too much in consequence of others being wronged, it
14927: seems to me that the divine voice which tells us to set that wrong
14928: right must be obeyed.”
14929: 
14930: “What, my love, is the bearing of your remark?”
14931: 
14932: “That you have been too liberal in arrangements for me—I mean, with
14933: regard to property; and that makes me unhappy.”
14934: 
14935: “How so? I have none but comparatively distant connections.”
14936: 
14937: “I have been led to think about your aunt Julia, and how she was left
14938: in poverty only because she married a poor man, an act which was not
14939: disgraceful, since he was not unworthy. It was on that ground, I know,
14940: that you educated Mr. Ladislaw and provided for his mother.”
14941: 
14942: Dorothea waited a few moments for some answer that would help her
14943: onward. None came, and her next words seemed the more forcible to her,
14944: falling clear upon the dark silence.
14945: 
14946: “But surely we should regard his claim as a much greater one, even to
14947: the half of that property which I know that you have destined for me.
14948: And I think he ought at once to be provided for on that understanding.
14949: It is not right that he should be in the dependence of poverty while we
14950: are rich. And if there is any objection to the proposal he mentioned,
14951: the giving him his true place and his true share would set aside any
14952: motive for his accepting it.”
14953: 
14954: “Mr. Ladislaw has probably been speaking to you on this subject?” said
14955: Mr. Casaubon, with a certain biting quickness not habitual to him.
14956: 
14957: “Indeed, no!” said Dorothea, earnestly. “How can you imagine it, since
14958: he has so lately declined everything from you? I fear you think too
14959: hardly of him, dear. He only told me a little about his parents and
14960: grandparents, and almost all in answer to my questions. You are so
14961: good, so just—you have done everything you thought to be right. But it
14962: seems to me clear that more than that is right; and I must speak about
14963: it, since I am the person who would get what is called benefit by that
14964: ‘more’ not being done.”
14965: 
14966: There was a perceptible pause before Mr. Casaubon replied, not quickly
14967: as before, but with a still more biting emphasis.
14968: 
14969: “Dorothea, my love, this is not the first occasion, but it were well
14970: that it should be the last, on which you have assumed a judgment on
14971: subjects beyond your scope. Into the question how far conduct,
14972: especially in the matter of alliances, constitutes a forfeiture of
14973: family claims, I do not now enter. Suffice it, that you are not here
14974: qualified to discriminate. What I now wish you to understand is, that I
14975: accept no revision, still less dictation within that range of affairs
14976: which I have deliberated upon as distinctly and properly mine. It is
14977: not for you to interfere between me and Mr. Ladislaw, and still less to
14978: encourage communications from him to you which constitute a criticism
14979: on my procedure.”
14980: 
14981: Poor Dorothea, shrouded in the darkness, was in a tumult of conflicting
14982: emotions. Alarm at the possible effect on himself of her husband’s
14983: strongly manifested anger, would have checked any expression of her own
14984: resentment, even if she had been quite free from doubt and compunction
14985: under the consciousness that there might be some justice in his last
14986: insinuation. Hearing him breathe quickly after he had spoken, she sat
14987: listening, frightened, wretched—with a dumb inward cry for help to bear
14988: this nightmare of a life in which every energy was arrested by dread.
14989: But nothing else happened, except that they both remained a long while
14990: sleepless, without speaking again.
14991: 
14992: The next day, Mr. Casaubon received the following answer from Will
14993: Ladislaw:—
14994: 
14995: “DEAR MR. CASAUBON,—I have given all due consideration to your letter
14996: of yesterday, but I am unable to take precisely your view of our mutual
14997: position. With the fullest acknowledgment of your generous conduct to
14998: me in the past, I must still maintain that an obligation of this kind
14999: cannot fairly fetter me as you appear to expect that it should. Granted
15000: that a benefactor’s wishes may constitute a claim; there must always be
15001: a reservation as to the quality of those wishes. They may possibly
15002: clash with more imperative considerations. Or a benefactor’s veto might
15003: impose such a negation on a man’s life that the consequent blank might
15004: be more cruel than the benefaction was generous. I am merely using
15005: strong illustrations. In the present case I am unable to take your view
15006: of the bearing which my acceptance of occupation—not enriching
15007: certainly, but not dishonorable—will have on your own position which
15008: seems to me too substantial to be affected in that shadowy manner. And
15009: though I do not believe that any change in our relations will occur
15010: (certainly none has yet occurred) which can nullify the obligations
15011: imposed on me by the past, pardon me for not seeing that those
15012: obligations should restrain me from using the ordinary freedom of
15013: living where I choose, and maintaining myself by any lawful occupation
15014: I may choose. Regretting that there exists this difference between us
15015: as to a relation in which the conferring of benefits has been entirely
15016: on your side—
15017: 
15018: 
15019: I remain, yours with persistent obligation,
15020: WILL LADISLAW.”
15021: 
15022: 
15023: Poor Mr. Casaubon felt (and must not we, being impartial, feel with him
15024: a little?) that no man had juster cause for disgust and suspicion than
15025: he. Young Ladislaw, he was sure, meant to defy and annoy him, meant to
15026: win Dorothea’s confidence and sow her mind with disrespect, and perhaps
15027: aversion, towards her husband. Some motive beneath the surface had been
15028: needed to account for Will’s sudden change of course in rejecting Mr.
15029: Casaubon’s aid and quitting his travels; and this defiant determination
15030: to fix himself in the neighborhood by taking up something so much at
15031: variance with his former choice as Mr. Brooke’s Middlemarch projects,
15032: revealed clearly enough that the undeclared motive had relation to
15033: Dorothea. Not for one moment did Mr. Casaubon suspect Dorothea of any
15034: doubleness: he had no suspicions of her, but he had (what was little
15035: less uncomfortable) the positive knowledge that her tendency to form
15036: opinions about her husband’s conduct was accompanied with a disposition
15037: to regard Will Ladislaw favorably and be influenced by what he said.
15038: His own proud reticence had prevented him from ever being undeceived in
15039: the supposition that Dorothea had originally asked her uncle to invite
15040: Will to his house.
15041: 
15042: And now, on receiving Will’s letter, Mr. Casaubon had to consider his
15043: duty. He would never have been easy to call his action anything else
15044: than duty; but in this case, contending motives thrust him back into
15045: negations.
15046: 
15047: Should he apply directly to Mr. Brooke, and demand of that troublesome
15048: gentleman to revoke his proposal? Or should he consult Sir James
15049: Chettam, and get him to concur in remonstrance against a step which
15050: touched the whole family? In either case Mr. Casaubon was aware that
15051: failure was just as probable as success. It was impossible for him to
15052: mention Dorothea’s name in the matter, and without some alarming
15053: urgency Mr. Brooke was as likely as not, after meeting all
15054: representations with apparent assent, to wind up by saying, “Never
15055: fear, Casaubon! Depend upon it, young Ladislaw will do you credit.
15056: Depend upon it, I have put my finger on the right thing.” And Mr.
15057: Casaubon shrank nervously from communicating on the subject with Sir
15058: James Chettam, between whom and himself there had never been any
15059: cordiality, and who would immediately think of Dorothea without any
15060: mention of her.
15061: 
15062: Poor Mr. Casaubon was distrustful of everybody’s feeling towards him,
15063: especially as a husband. To let any one suppose that he was jealous
15064: would be to admit their (suspected) view of his disadvantages: to let
15065: them know that he did not find marriage particularly blissful would
15066: imply his conversion to their (probably) earlier disapproval. It would
15067: be as bad as letting Carp, and Brasenose generally, know how backward
15068: he was in organizing the matter for his “Key to all Mythologies.” All
15069: through his life Mr. Casaubon had been trying not to admit even to
15070: himself the inward sores of self-doubt and jealousy. And on the most
15071: delicate of all personal subjects, the habit of proud suspicious
15072: reticence told doubly.
15073: 
15074: Thus Mr. Casaubon remained proudly, bitterly silent. But he had
15075: forbidden Will to come to Lowick Manor, and he was mentally preparing
15076: other measures of frustration.
15077: 
15078: 
15079: 
15080: 
15081: CHAPTER XXXVIII.
15082: 
15083: “C’est beaucoup que le jugement des hommes sur les actions humaines;
15084: tôt ou tard il devient efficace.”—GUIZOT.
15085: 
15086: 
15087: Sir James Chettam could not look with any satisfaction on Mr. Brooke’s
15088: new courses; but it was easier to object than to hinder. Sir James
15089: accounted for his having come in alone one day to lunch with the
15090: Cadwalladers by saying—
15091: 
15092: “I can’t talk to you as I want, before Celia: it might hurt her.
15093: Indeed, it would not be right.”
15094: 
15095: “I know what you mean—the ‘Pioneer’ at the Grange!” darted in Mrs.
15096: Cadwallader, almost before the last word was off her friend’s tongue.
15097: “It is frightful—this taking to buying whistles and blowing them in
15098: everybody’s hearing. Lying in bed all day and playing at dominoes, like
15099: poor Lord Plessy, would be more private and bearable.”
15100: 
15101: “I see they are beginning to attack our friend Brooke in the
15102: ‘Trumpet,’” said the Rector, lounging back and smiling easily, as he
15103: would have done if he had been attacked himself. “There are tremendous
15104: sarcasms against a landlord not a hundred miles from Middlemarch, who
15105: receives his own rents, and makes no returns.”
15106: 
15107: “I do wish Brooke would leave that off,” said Sir James, with his
15108: little frown of annoyance.
15109: 
15110: “Is he really going to be put in nomination, though?” said Mr.
15111: Cadwallader. “I saw Farebrother yesterday—he’s Whiggish himself, hoists
15112: Brougham and Useful Knowledge; that’s the worst I know of him;—and he
15113: says that Brooke is getting up a pretty strong party. Bulstrode, the
15114: banker, is his foremost man. But he thinks Brooke would come off badly
15115: at a nomination.”
15116: 
15117: “Exactly,” said Sir James, with earnestness. “I have been inquiring
15118: into the thing, for I’ve never known anything about Middlemarch
15119: politics before—the county being my business. What Brooke trusts to, is
15120: that they are going to turn out Oliver because he is a Peelite. But
15121: Hawley tells me that if they send up a Whig at all it is sure to be
15122: Bagster, one of those candidates who come from heaven knows where, but
15123: dead against Ministers, and an experienced Parliamentary man. Hawley’s
15124: rather rough: he forgot that he was speaking to me. He said if Brooke
15125: wanted a pelting, he could get it cheaper than by going to the
15126: hustings.”
15127: 
15128: “I warned you all of it,” said Mrs. Cadwallader, waving her hands
15129: outward. “I said to Humphrey long ago, Mr. Brooke is going to make a
15130: splash in the mud. And now he has done it.”
15131: 
15132: “Well, he might have taken it into his head to marry,” said the Rector.
15133: “That would have been a graver mess than a little flirtation with
15134: politics.”
15135: 
15136: “He may do that afterwards,” said Mrs. Cadwallader—“when he has come
15137: out on the other side of the mud with an ague.”
15138: 
15139: “What I care for most is his own dignity,” said Sir James. “Of course I
15140: care the more because of the family. But he’s getting on in life now,
15141: and I don’t like to think of his exposing himself. They will be raking
15142: up everything against him.”
15143: 
15144: “I suppose it’s no use trying any persuasion,” said the Rector.
15145: “There’s such an odd mixture of obstinacy and changeableness in Brooke.
15146: Have you tried him on the subject?”
15147: 
15148: “Well, no,” said Sir James; “I feel a delicacy in appearing to dictate.
15149: But I have been talking to this young Ladislaw that Brooke is making a
15150: factotum of. Ladislaw seems clever enough for anything. I thought it as
15151: well to hear what he had to say; and he is against Brooke’s standing
15152: this time. I think he’ll turn him round: I think the nomination may be
15153: staved off.”
15154: 
15155: “I know,” said Mrs. Cadwallader, nodding. “The independent member
15156: hasn’t got his speeches well enough by heart.”
15157: 
15158: “But this Ladislaw—there again is a vexatious business,” said Sir
15159: James. “We have had him two or three times to dine at the Hall (you
15160: have met him, by the bye) as Brooke’s guest and a relation of
15161: Casaubon’s, thinking he was only on a flying visit. And now I find he’s
15162: in everybody’s mouth in Middlemarch as the editor of the ‘Pioneer.’
15163: There are stories going about him as a quill-driving alien, a foreign
15164: emissary, and what not.”
15165: 
15166: “Casaubon won’t like that,” said the Rector.
15167: 
15168: “There _is_ some foreign blood in Ladislaw,” returned Sir James. “I
15169: hope he won’t go into extreme opinions and carry Brooke on.”
15170: 
15171: “Oh, he’s a dangerous young sprig, that Mr. Ladislaw,” said Mrs.
15172: Cadwallader, “with his opera songs and his ready tongue. A sort of
15173: Byronic hero—an amorous conspirator, it strikes me. And Thomas Aquinas
15174: is not fond of him. I could see that, the day the picture was brought.”
15175: 
15176: “I don’t like to begin on the subject with Casaubon,” said Sir James.
15177: “He has more right to interfere than I. But it’s a disagreeable affair
15178: all round. What a character for anybody with decent connections to show
15179: himself in!—one of those newspaper fellows! You have only to look at
15180: Keck, who manages the ‘Trumpet.’ I saw him the other day with Hawley.
15181: His writing is sound enough, I believe, but he’s such a low fellow,
15182: that I wished he had been on the wrong side.”
15183: 
15184: “What can you expect with these peddling Middlemarch papers?” said the
15185: Rector. “I don’t suppose you could get a high style of man anywhere to
15186: be writing up interests he doesn’t really care about, and for pay that
15187: hardly keeps him in at elbows.”
15188: 
15189: “Exactly: that makes it so annoying that Brooke should have put a man
15190: who has a sort of connection with the family in a position of that
15191: kind. For my part, I think Ladislaw is rather a fool for accepting.”
15192: 
15193: “It is Aquinas’s fault,” said Mrs. Cadwallader. “Why didn’t he use his
15194: interest to get Ladislaw made an _attache_ or sent to India? That is
15195: how families get rid of troublesome sprigs.”
15196: 
15197: “There is no knowing to what lengths the mischief may go,” said Sir
15198: James, anxiously. “But if Casaubon says nothing, what can I do?”
15199: 
15200: “Oh my dear Sir James,” said the Rector, “don’t let us make too much of
15201: all this. It is likely enough to end in mere smoke. After a month or
15202: two Brooke and this Master Ladislaw will get tired of each other;
15203: Ladislaw will take wing; Brooke will sell the ‘Pioneer,’ and everything
15204: will settle down again as usual.”
15205: 
15206: “There is one good chance—that he will not like to feel his money
15207: oozing away,” said Mrs. Cadwallader. “If I knew the items of election
15208: expenses I could scare him. It’s no use plying him with wide words like
15209: Expenditure: I wouldn’t talk of phlebotomy, I would empty a pot of
15210: leeches upon him. What we good stingy people don’t like, is having our
15211: sixpences sucked away from us.”
15212: 
15213: “And he will not like having things raked up against him,” said Sir
15214: James. “There is the management of his estate. They have begun upon
15215: that already. And it really is painful for me to see. It is a nuisance
15216: under one’s very nose. I do think one is bound to do the best for one’s
15217: land and tenants, especially in these hard times.”
15218: 
15219: “Perhaps the ‘Trumpet’ may rouse him to make a change, and some good
15220: may come of it all,” said the Rector. “I know I should be glad. I
15221: should hear less grumbling when my tithe is paid. I don’t know what I
15222: should do if there were not a modus in Tipton.”
15223: 
15224: “I want him to have a proper man to look after things—I want him to
15225: take on Garth again,” said Sir James. “He got rid of Garth twelve years
15226: ago, and everything has been going wrong since. I think of getting
15227: Garth to manage for me—he has made such a capital plan for my
15228: buildings; and Lovegood is hardly up to the mark. But Garth would not
15229: undertake the Tipton estate again unless Brooke left it entirely to
15230: him.”
15231: 
15232: “In the right of it too,” said the Rector. “Garth is an independent
15233: fellow: an original, simple-minded fellow. One day, when he was doing
15234: some valuation for me, he told me point-blank that clergymen seldom
15235: understood anything about business, and did mischief when they meddled;
15236: but he said it as quietly and respectfully as if he had been talking to
15237: me about sailors. He would make a different parish of Tipton, if Brooke
15238: would let him manage. I wish, by the help of the ‘Trumpet,’ you could
15239: bring that round.”
15240: 
15241: “If Dorothea had kept near her uncle, there would have been some
15242: chance,” said Sir James. “She might have got some power over him in
15243: time, and she was always uneasy about the estate. She had wonderfully
15244: good notions about such things. But now Casaubon takes her up entirely.
15245: Celia complains a good deal. We can hardly get her to dine with us,
15246: since he had that fit.” Sir James ended with a look of pitying disgust,
15247: and Mrs. Cadwallader shrugged her shoulders as much as to say that
15248: _she_ was not likely to see anything new in that direction.
15249: 
15250: “Poor Casaubon!” the Rector said. “That was a nasty attack. I thought
15251: he looked shattered the other day at the Archdeacon’s.”
15252: 
15253: “In point of fact,” resumed Sir James, not choosing to dwell on “fits,”
15254: “Brooke doesn’t mean badly by his tenants or any one else, but he has
15255: got that way of paring and clipping at expenses.”
15256: 
15257: “Come, that’s a blessing,” said Mrs. Cadwallader. “That helps him to
15258: find himself in a morning. He may not know his own opinions, but he
15259: does know his own pocket.”
15260: 
15261: “I don’t believe a man is in pocket by stinginess on his land,” said
15262: Sir James.
15263: 
15264: “Oh, stinginess may be abused like other virtues: it will not do to
15265: keep one’s own pigs lean,” said Mrs. Cadwallader, who had risen to look
15266: out of the window. “But talk of an independent politician and he will
15267: appear.”
15268: 
15269: “What! Brooke?” said her husband.
15270: 
15271: “Yes. Now, you ply him with the ‘Trumpet,’ Humphrey; and I will put the
15272: leeches on him. What will you do, Sir James?”
15273: 
15274: “The fact is, I don’t like to begin about it with Brooke, in our mutual
15275: position; the whole thing is so unpleasant. I do wish people would
15276: behave like gentlemen,” said the good baronet, feeling that this was a
15277: simple and comprehensive programme for social well-being.
15278: 
15279: “Here you all are, eh?” said Mr. Brooke, shuffling round and shaking
15280: hands. “I was going up to the Hall by-and-by, Chettam. But it’s
15281: pleasant to find everybody, you know. Well, what do you think of
15282: things?—going on a little fast! It was true enough, what Lafitte
15283: said—‘Since yesterday, a century has passed away:’—they’re in the next
15284: century, you know, on the other side of the water. Going on faster than
15285: we are.”
15286: 
15287: “Why, yes,” said the Rector, taking up the newspaper. “Here is the
15288: ‘Trumpet’ accusing you of lagging behind—did you see?”
15289: 
15290: “Eh? no,” said Mr. Brooke, dropping his gloves into his hat and hastily
15291: adjusting his eye-glass. But Mr. Cadwallader kept the paper in his
15292: hand, saying, with a smile in his eyes—
15293: 
15294: “Look here! all this is about a landlord not a hundred miles from
15295: Middlemarch, who receives his own rents. They say he is the most
15296: retrogressive man in the county. I think you must have taught them that
15297: word in the ‘Pioneer.’”
15298: 
15299: “Oh, that is Keck—an illiterate fellow, you know. Retrogressive, now!
15300: Come, that’s capital. He thinks it means destructive: they want to make
15301: me out a destructive, you know,” said Mr. Brooke, with that
15302: cheerfulness which is usually sustained by an adversary’s ignorance.
15303: 
15304: “I think he knows the meaning of the word. Here is a sharp stroke or
15305: two. _If we had to describe a man who is retrogressive in the most evil
15306: sense of the word—we should say, he is one who would dub himself a
15307: reformer of our constitution, while every interest for which he is
15308: immediately responsible is going to decay: a philanthropist who cannot
15309: bear one rogue to be hanged, but does not mind five honest tenants
15310: being half-starved: a man who shrieks at corruption, and keeps his
15311: farms at rack-rent: who roars himself red at rotten boroughs, and does
15312: not mind if every field on his farms has a rotten gate: a man very
15313: open-hearted to Leeds and Manchester, no doubt; he would give any
15314: number of representatives who will pay for their seats out of their own
15315: pockets: what he objects to giving, is a little return on rent-days to
15316: help a tenant to buy stock, or an outlay on repairs to keep the weather
15317: out at a tenant’s barn-door or make his house look a little less like
15318: an Irish cottier’s. But we all know the wag’s definition of a
15319: philanthropist: a man whose charity increases directly as the square of
15320: the distance._ And so on. All the rest is to show what sort of
15321: legislator a philanthropist is likely to make,” ended the Rector,
15322: throwing down the paper, and clasping his hands at the back of his
15323: head, while he looked at Mr. Brooke with an air of amused neutrality.
15324: 
15325: “Come, that’s rather good, you know,” said Mr. Brooke, taking up the
15326: paper and trying to bear the attack as easily as his neighbor did, but
15327: coloring and smiling rather nervously; “that about roaring himself red
15328: at rotten boroughs—I never made a speech about rotten boroughs in my
15329: life. And as to roaring myself red and that kind of thing—these men
15330: never understand what is good satire. Satire, you know, should be true
15331: up to a certain point. I recollect they said that in ‘The Edinburgh’
15332: somewhere—it must be true up to a certain point.”
15333: 
15334: “Well, that is really a hit about the gates,” said Sir James, anxious
15335: to tread carefully. “Dagley complained to me the other day that he
15336: hadn’t got a decent gate on his farm. Garth has invented a new pattern
15337: of gate—I wish you would try it. One ought to use some of one’s timber
15338: in that way.”
15339: 
15340: “You go in for fancy farming, you know, Chettam,” said Mr. Brooke,
15341: appearing to glance over the columns of the “Trumpet.” “That’s your
15342: hobby, and you don’t mind the expense.”
15343: 
15344: “I thought the most expensive hobby in the world was standing for
15345: Parliament,” said Mrs. Cadwallader. “They said the last unsuccessful
15346: candidate at Middlemarch—Giles, wasn’t his name?—spent ten thousand
15347: pounds and failed because he did not bribe enough. What a bitter
15348: reflection for a man!”
15349: 
15350: “Somebody was saying,” said the Rector, laughingly, “that East Retford
15351: was nothing to Middlemarch, for bribery.”
15352: 
15353: “Nothing of the kind,” said Mr. Brooke. “The Tories bribe, you know:
15354: Hawley and his set bribe with treating, hot codlings, and that sort of
15355: thing; and they bring the voters drunk to the poll. But they are not
15356: going to have it their own way in future—not in future, you know.
15357: Middlemarch is a little backward, I admit—the freemen are a little
15358: backward. But we shall educate them—we shall bring them on, you know.
15359: The best people there are on our side.”
15360: 
15361: “Hawley says you have men on your side who will do you harm,” remarked
15362: Sir James. “He says Bulstrode the banker will do you harm.”
15363: 
15364: “And that if you got pelted,” interposed Mrs. Cadwallader, “half the
15365: rotten eggs would mean hatred of your committee-man. Good heavens!
15366: Think what it must be to be pelted for wrong opinions. And I seem to
15367: remember a story of a man they pretended to chair and let him fall into
15368: a dust-heap on purpose!”
15369: 
15370: “Pelting is nothing to their finding holes in one’s coat,” said the
15371: Rector. “I confess that’s what I should be afraid of, if we parsons had
15372: to stand at the hustings for preferment. I should be afraid of their
15373: reckoning up all my fishing days. Upon my word, I think the truth is
15374: the hardest missile one can be pelted with.”
15375: 
15376: “The fact is,” said Sir James, “if a man goes into public life he must
15377: be prepared for the consequences. He must make himself proof against
15378: calumny.”
15379: 
15380: “My dear Chettam, that is all very fine, you know,” said Mr. Brooke.
15381: “But how will you make yourself proof against calumny? You should read
15382: history—look at ostracism, persecution, martyrdom, and that kind of
15383: thing. They always happen to the best men, you know. But what is that
15384: in Horace?—_fiat justitia, ruat_ … something or other.”
15385: 
15386: “Exactly,” said Sir James, with a little more heat than usual. “What I
15387: mean by being proof against calumny is being able to point to the fact
15388: as a contradiction.”
15389: 
15390: “And it is not martyrdom to pay bills that one has run into one’s
15391: self,” said Mrs. Cadwallader.
15392: 
15393: But it was Sir James’s evident annoyance that most stirred Mr. Brooke.
15394: “Well, you know, Chettam,” he said, rising, taking up his hat and
15395: leaning on his stick, “you and I have a different system. You are all
15396: for outlay with your farms. I don’t want to make out that my system is
15397: good under all circumstances—under all circumstances, you know.”
15398: 
15399: “There ought to be a new valuation made from time to time,” said Sir
15400: James. “Returns are very well occasionally, but I like a fair
15401: valuation. What do you say, Cadwallader?”
15402: 
15403: “I agree with you. If I were Brooke, I would choke the ‘Trumpet’ at
15404: once by getting Garth to make a new valuation of the farms, and giving
15405: him _carte blanche_ about gates and repairs: that’s my view of the
15406: political situation,” said the Rector, broadening himself by sticking
15407: his thumbs in his armholes, and laughing towards Mr. Brooke.
15408: 
15409: “That’s a showy sort of thing to do, you know,” said Mr. Brooke. “But I
15410: should like you to tell me of another landlord who has distressed his
15411: tenants for arrears as little as I have. I let the old tenants stay on.
15412: I’m uncommonly easy, let me tell you, uncommonly easy. I have my own
15413: ideas, and I take my stand on them, you know. A man who does that is
15414: always charged with eccentricity, inconsistency, and that kind of
15415: thing. When I change my line of action, I shall follow my own ideas.”
15416: 
15417: After that, Mr. Brooke remembered that there was a packet which he had
15418: omitted to send off from the Grange, and he bade everybody hurriedly
15419: good-by.
15420: 
15421: “I didn’t want to take a liberty with Brooke,” said Sir James; “I see
15422: he is nettled. But as to what he says about old tenants, in point of
15423: fact no new tenant would take the farms on the present terms.”
15424: 
15425: “I have a notion that he will be brought round in time,” said the
15426: Rector. “But you were pulling one way, Elinor, and we were pulling
15427: another. You wanted to frighten him away from expense, and we want to
15428: frighten him into it. Better let him try to be popular and see that his
15429: character as a landlord stands in his way. I don’t think it signifies
15430: two straws about the ‘Pioneer,’ or Ladislaw, or Brooke’s speechifying
15431: to the Middlemarchers. But it does signify about the parishioners in
15432: Tipton being comfortable.”
15433: 
15434: “Excuse me, it is you two who are on the wrong tack,” said Mrs.
15435: Cadwallader. “You should have proved to him that he loses money by bad
15436: management, and then we should all have pulled together. If you put him
15437: a-horseback on politics, I warn you of the consequences. It was all
15438: very well to ride on sticks at home and call them ideas.”
15439: 
15440: 
15441: 
15442: 
15443: CHAPTER XXXIX.
15444: 
15445: “If, as I have, you also doe,
15446:     Vertue attired in woman see,
15447: And dare love that, and say so too,
15448:     And forget the He and She;
15449: 
15450: And if this love, though placed so,
15451:     From prophane men you hide,
15452: Which will no faith on this bestow,
15453:     Or, if they doe, deride:
15454: 
15455: Then you have done a braver thing
15456:     Than all the Worthies did,
15457: And a braver thence will spring,
15458:     Which is, to keep that hid.”
15459: —DR. DONNE.
15460: 
15461: 
15462: Sir James Chettam’s mind was not fruitful in devices, but his growing
15463: anxiety to “act on Brooke,” once brought close to his constant belief
15464: in Dorothea’s capacity for influence, became formative, and issued in a
15465: little plan; namely, to plead Celia’s indisposition as a reason for
15466: fetching Dorothea by herself to the Hall, and to leave her at the
15467: Grange with the carriage on the way, after making her fully aware of
15468: the situation concerning the management of the estate.
15469: 
15470: In this way it happened that one day near four o’clock, when Mr. Brooke
15471: and Ladislaw were seated in the library, the door opened and Mrs.
15472: Casaubon was announced.
15473: 
15474: Will, the moment before, had been low in the depths of boredom, and,
15475: obliged to help Mr. Brooke in arranging “documents” about hanging
15476: sheep-stealers, was exemplifying the power our minds have of riding
15477: several horses at once by inwardly arranging measures towards getting a
15478: lodging for himself in Middlemarch and cutting short his constant
15479: residence at the Grange; while there flitted through all these steadier
15480: images a tickling vision of a sheep-stealing epic written with Homeric
15481: particularity. When Mrs. Casaubon was announced he started up as from
15482: an electric shock, and felt a tingling at his finger-ends. Any one
15483: observing him would have seen a change in his complexion, in the
15484: adjustment of his facial muscles, in the vividness of his glance, which
15485: might have made them imagine that every molecule in his body had passed
15486: the message of a magic touch. And so it had. For effective magic is
15487: transcendent nature; and who shall measure the subtlety of those
15488: touches which convey the quality of soul as well as body, and make a
15489: man’s passion for one woman differ from his passion for another as joy
15490: in the morning light over valley and river and white mountain-top
15491: differs from joy among Chinese lanterns and glass panels? Will, too,
15492: was made of very impressible stuff. The bow of a violin drawn near him
15493: cleverly, would at one stroke change the aspect of the world for him,
15494: and his point of view shifted as easily as his mood. Dorothea’s
15495: entrance was the freshness of morning.
15496: 
15497: “Well, my dear, this is pleasant, now,” said Mr. Brooke, meeting and
15498: kissing her. “You have left Casaubon with his books, I suppose. That’s
15499: right. We must not have you getting too learned for a woman, you know.”
15500: 
15501: “There is no fear of that, uncle,” said Dorothea, turning to Will and
15502: shaking hands with open cheerfulness, while she made no other form of
15503: greeting, but went on answering her uncle. “I am very slow. When I want
15504: to be busy with books, I am often playing truant among my thoughts. I
15505: find it is not so easy to be learned as to plan cottages.”
15506: 
15507: She seated herself beside her uncle opposite to Will, and was evidently
15508: preoccupied with something that made her almost unmindful of him. He
15509: was ridiculously disappointed, as if he had imagined that her coming
15510: had anything to do with him.
15511: 
15512: “Why, yes, my dear, it was quite your hobby to draw plans. But it was
15513: good to break that off a little. Hobbies are apt to run away with us,
15514: you know; it doesn’t do to be run away with. We must keep the reins. I
15515: have never let myself be run away with; I always pulled up. That is
15516: what I tell Ladislaw. He and I are alike, you know: he likes to go into
15517: everything. We are working at capital punishment. We shall do a great
15518: deal together, Ladislaw and I.”
15519: 
15520: “Yes,” said Dorothea, with characteristic directness, “Sir James has
15521: been telling me that he is in hope of seeing a great change made soon
15522: in your management of the estate—that you are thinking of having the
15523: farms valued, and repairs made, and the cottages improved, so that
15524: Tipton may look quite another place. Oh, how happy!”—she went on,
15525: clasping her hands, with a return to that more childlike impetuous
15526: manner, which had been subdued since her marriage. “If I were at home
15527: still, I should take to riding again, that I might go about with you
15528: and see all that! And you are going to engage Mr. Garth, who praised my
15529: cottages, Sir James says.”
15530: 
15531: “Chettam is a little hasty, my dear,” said Mr. Brooke, coloring
15532: slightly; “a little hasty, you know. I never said I should do anything
15533: of the kind. I never said I should _not_ do it, you know.”
15534: 
15535: “He only feels confident that you will do it,” said Dorothea, in a
15536: voice as clear and unhesitating as that of a young chorister chanting a
15537: credo, “because you mean to enter Parliament as a member who cares for
15538: the improvement of the people, and one of the first things to be made
15539: better is the state of the land and the laborers. Think of Kit Downes,
15540: uncle, who lives with his wife and seven children in a house with one
15541: sitting room and one bedroom hardly larger than this table!—and those
15542: poor Dagleys, in their tumble-down farmhouse, where they live in the
15543: back kitchen and leave the other rooms to the rats! That is one reason
15544: why I did not like the pictures here, dear uncle—which you think me
15545: stupid about. I used to come from the village with all that dirt and
15546: coarse ugliness like a pain within me, and the simpering pictures in
15547: the drawing-room seemed to me like a wicked attempt to find delight in
15548: what is false, while we don’t mind how hard the truth is for the
15549: neighbors outside our walls. I think we have no right to come forward
15550: and urge wider changes for good, until we have tried to alter the evils
15551: which lie under our own hands.”
15552: 
15553: Dorothea had gathered emotion as she went on, and had forgotten
15554: everything except the relief of pouring forth her feelings, unchecked:
15555: an experience once habitual with her, but hardly ever present since her
15556: marriage, which had been a perpetual struggle of energy with fear. For
15557: the moment, Will’s admiration was accompanied with a chilling sense of
15558: remoteness. A man is seldom ashamed of feeling that he cannot love a
15559: woman so well when he sees a certain greatness in her: nature having
15560: intended greatness for men. But nature has sometimes made sad
15561: oversights in carrying out her intention; as in the case of good Mr.
15562: Brooke, whose masculine consciousness was at this moment in rather a
15563: stammering condition under the eloquence of his niece. He could not
15564: immediately find any other mode of expressing himself than that of
15565: rising, fixing his eye-glass, and fingering the papers before him. At
15566: last he said—
15567: 
15568: “There is something in what you say, my dear, something in what you
15569: say—but not everything—eh, Ladislaw? You and I don’t like our pictures
15570: and statues being found fault with. Young ladies are a little ardent,
15571: you know—a little one-sided, my dear. Fine art, poetry, that kind of
15572: thing, elevates a nation—_emollit mores_—you understand a little Latin
15573: now. But—eh? what?”
15574: 
15575: These interrogatives were addressed to the footman who had come in to
15576: say that the keeper had found one of Dagley’s boys with a leveret in
15577: his hand just killed.
15578: 
15579: “I’ll come, I’ll come. I shall let him off easily, you know,” said Mr.
15580: Brooke aside to Dorothea, shuffling away very cheerfully.
15581: 
15582: “I hope you feel how right this change is that I—that Sir James wishes
15583: for,” said Dorothea to Will, as soon as her uncle was gone.
15584: 
15585: “I do, now I have heard you speak about it. I shall not forget what you
15586: have said. But can you think of something else at this moment? I may
15587: not have another opportunity of speaking to you about what has
15588: occurred,” said Will, rising with a movement of impatience, and holding
15589: the back of his chair with both hands.
15590: 
15591: “Pray tell me what it is,” said Dorothea, anxiously, also rising and
15592: going to the open window, where Monk was looking in, panting and
15593: wagging his tail. She leaned her back against the window-frame, and
15594: laid her hand on the dog’s head; for though, as we know, she was not
15595: fond of pets that must be held in the hands or trodden on, she was
15596: always attentive to the feelings of dogs, and very polite if she had to
15597: decline their advances.
15598: 
15599: Will followed her only with his eyes and said, “I presume you know that
15600: Mr. Casaubon has forbidden me to go to his house.”
15601: 
15602: “No, I did not,” said Dorothea, after a moment’s pause. She was
15603: evidently much moved. “I am very, very sorry,” she added, mournfully.
15604: She was thinking of what Will had no knowledge of—the conversation
15605: between her and her husband in the darkness; and she was anew smitten
15606: with hopelessness that she could influence Mr. Casaubon’s action. But
15607: the marked expression of her sorrow convinced Will that it was not all
15608: given to him personally, and that Dorothea had not been visited by the
15609: idea that Mr. Casaubon’s dislike and jealousy of him turned upon
15610: herself. He felt an odd mixture of delight and vexation: of delight
15611: that he could dwell and be cherished in her thought as in a pure home,
15612: without suspicion and without stint—of vexation because he was of too
15613: little account with her, was not formidable enough, was treated with an
15614: unhesitating benevolence which did not flatter him. But his dread of
15615: any change in Dorothea was stronger than his discontent, and he began
15616: to speak again in a tone of mere explanation.
15617: 
15618: “Mr. Casaubon’s reason is, his displeasure at my taking a position here
15619: which he considers unsuited to my rank as his cousin. I have told him
15620: that I cannot give way on this point. It is a little too hard on me to
15621: expect that my course in life is to be hampered by prejudices which I
15622: think ridiculous. Obligation may be stretched till it is no better than
15623: a brand of slavery stamped on us when we were too young to know its
15624: meaning. I would not have accepted the position if I had not meant to
15625: make it useful and honorable. I am not bound to regard family dignity
15626: in any other light.”
15627: 
15628: Dorothea felt wretched. She thought her husband altogether in the
15629: wrong, on more grounds than Will had mentioned.
15630: 
15631: “It is better for us not to speak on the subject,” she said, with a
15632: tremulousness not common in her voice, “since you and Mr. Casaubon
15633: disagree. You intend to remain?” She was looking out on the lawn, with
15634: melancholy meditation.
15635: 
15636: “Yes; but I shall hardly ever see you now,” said Will, in a tone of
15637: almost boyish complaint.
15638: 
15639: “No,” said Dorothea, turning her eyes full upon him, “hardly ever. But
15640: I shall hear of you. I shall know what you are doing for my uncle.”
15641: 
15642: “I shall know hardly anything about you,” said Will. “No one will tell
15643: me anything.”
15644: 
15645: “Oh, my life is very simple,” said Dorothea, her lips curling with an
15646: exquisite smile, which irradiated her melancholy. “I am always at
15647: Lowick.”
15648: 
15649: “That is a dreadful imprisonment,” said Will, impetuously.
15650: 
15651: “No, don’t think that,” said Dorothea. “I have no longings.”
15652: 
15653: He did not speak, but she replied to some change in his expression. “I
15654: mean, for myself. Except that I should like not to have so much more
15655: than my share without doing anything for others. But I have a belief of
15656: my own, and it comforts me.”
15657: 
15658: “What is that?” said Will, rather jealous of the belief.
15659: 
15660: “That by desiring what is perfectly good, even when we don’t quite know
15661: what it is and cannot do what we would, we are part of the divine power
15662: against evil—widening the skirts of light and making the struggle with
15663: darkness narrower.”
15664: 
15665: “That is a beautiful mysticism—it is a—”
15666: 
15667: “Please not to call it by any name,” said Dorothea, putting out her
15668: hands entreatingly. “You will say it is Persian, or something else
15669: geographical. It is my life. I have found it out, and cannot part with
15670: it. I have always been finding out my religion since I was a little
15671: girl. I used to pray so much—now I hardly ever pray. I try not to have
15672: desires merely for myself, because they may not be good for others, and
15673: I have too much already. I only told you, that you might know quite
15674: well how my days go at Lowick.”
15675: 
15676: “God bless you for telling me!” said Will, ardently, and rather
15677: wondering at himself. They were looking at each other like two fond
15678: children who were talking confidentially of birds.
15679: 
15680: “What is _your_ religion?” said Dorothea. “I mean—not what you know
15681: about religion, but the belief that helps you most?”
15682: 
15683: “To love what is good and beautiful when I see it,” said Will. “But I
15684: am a rebel: I don’t feel bound, as you do, to submit to what I don’t
15685: like.”
15686: 
15687: “But if you like what is good, that comes to the same thing,” said
15688: Dorothea, smiling.
15689: 
15690: “Now you are subtle,” said Will.
15691: 
15692: “Yes; Mr. Casaubon often says I am too subtle. I don’t feel as if I
15693: were subtle,” said Dorothea, playfully. “But how long my uncle is! I
15694: must go and look for him. I must really go on to the Hall. Celia is
15695: expecting me.”
15696: 
15697: Will offered to tell Mr. Brooke, who presently came and said that he
15698: would step into the carriage and go with Dorothea as far as Dagley’s,
15699: to speak about the small delinquent who had been caught with the
15700: leveret. Dorothea renewed the subject of the estate as they drove
15701: along, but Mr. Brooke, not being taken unawares, got the talk under his
15702: own control.
15703: 
15704: “Chettam, now,” he replied; “he finds fault with me, my dear; but I
15705: should not preserve my game if it were not for Chettam, and he can’t
15706: say that that expense is for the sake of the tenants, you know. It’s a
15707: little against my feeling:—poaching, now, if you come to look into it—I
15708: have often thought of getting up the subject. Not long ago, Flavell,
15709: the Methodist preacher, was brought up for knocking down a hare that
15710: came across his path when he and his wife were walking out together. He
15711: was pretty quick, and knocked it on the neck.”
15712: 
15713: “That was very brutal, I think,” said Dorothea.
15714: 
15715: “Well, now, it seemed rather black to me, I confess, in a Methodist
15716: preacher, you know. And Johnson said, ‘You may judge what a hypo_crite_
15717: he is.’ And upon my word, I thought Flavell looked very little like
15718: ‘the highest style of man’—as somebody calls the Christian—Young, the
15719: poet Young, I think—you know Young? Well, now, Flavell in his shabby
15720: black gaiters, pleading that he thought the Lord had sent him and his
15721: wife a good dinner, and he had a right to knock it down, though not a
15722: mighty hunter before the Lord, as Nimrod was—I assure you it was rather
15723: comic: Fielding would have made something of it—or Scott, now—Scott
15724: might have worked it up. But really, when I came to think of it, I
15725: couldn’t help liking that the fellow should have a bit of hare to say
15726: grace over. It’s all a matter of prejudice—prejudice with the law on
15727: its side, you know—about the stick and the gaiters, and so on. However,
15728: it doesn’t do to reason about things; and law is law. But I got Johnson
15729: to be quiet, and I hushed the matter up. I doubt whether Chettam would
15730: not have been more severe, and yet he comes down on me as if I were the
15731: hardest man in the county. But here we are at Dagley’s.”
15732: 
15733: Mr. Brooke got down at a farmyard-gate, and Dorothea drove on. It is
15734: wonderful how much uglier things will look when we only suspect that we
15735: are blamed for them. Even our own persons in the glass are apt to
15736: change their aspect for us after we have heard some frank remark on
15737: their less admirable points; and on the other hand it is astonishing
15738: how pleasantly conscience takes our encroachments on those who never
15739: complain or have nobody to complain for them. Dagley’s homestead never
15740: before looked so dismal to Mr. Brooke as it did today, with his mind
15741: thus sore about the fault-finding of the “Trumpet,” echoed by Sir
15742: James.
15743: 
15744: It is true that an observer, under that softening influence of the fine
15745: arts which makes other people’s hardships picturesque, might have been
15746: delighted with this homestead called Freeman’s End: the old house had
15747: dormer-windows in the dark red roof, two of the chimneys were choked
15748: with ivy, the large porch was blocked up with bundles of sticks, and
15749: half the windows were closed with gray worm-eaten shutters about which
15750: the jasmine-boughs grew in wild luxuriance; the mouldering garden wall
15751: with hollyhocks peeping over it was a perfect study of highly mingled
15752: subdued color, and there was an aged goat (kept doubtless on
15753: interesting superstitious grounds) lying against the open back-kitchen
15754: door. The mossy thatch of the cow-shed, the broken gray barn-doors, the
15755: pauper laborers in ragged breeches who had nearly finished unloading a
15756: wagon of corn into the barn ready for early thrashing; the scanty dairy
15757: of cows being tethered for milking and leaving one half of the shed in
15758: brown emptiness; the very pigs and white ducks seeming to wander about
15759: the uneven neglected yard as if in low spirits from feeding on a too
15760: meagre quality of rinsings,—all these objects under the quiet light of
15761: a sky marbled with high clouds would have made a sort of picture which
15762: we have all paused over as a “charming bit,” touching other
15763: sensibilities than those which are stirred by the depression of the
15764: agricultural interest, with the sad lack of farming capital, as seen
15765: constantly in the newspapers of that time. But these troublesome
15766: associations were just now strongly present to Mr. Brooke, and spoiled
15767: the scene for him. Mr. Dagley himself made a figure in the landscape,
15768: carrying a pitchfork and wearing his milking-hat—a very old beaver
15769: flattened in front. His coat and breeches were the best he had, and he
15770: would not have been wearing them on this weekday occasion if he had not
15771: been to market and returned later than usual, having given himself the
15772: rare treat of dining at the public table of the Blue Bull. How he came
15773: to fall into this extravagance would perhaps be matter of wonderment to
15774: himself on the morrow; but before dinner something in the state of the
15775: country, a slight pause in the harvest before the Far Dips were cut,
15776: the stories about the new King and the numerous handbills on the walls,
15777: had seemed to warrant a little recklessness. It was a maxim about
15778: Middlemarch, and regarded as self-evident, that good meat should have
15779: good drink, which last Dagley interpreted as plenty of table ale well
15780: followed up by rum-and-water. These liquors have so far truth in them
15781: that they were not false enough to make poor Dagley seem merry: they
15782: only made his discontent less tongue-tied than usual. He had also taken
15783: too much in the shape of muddy political talk, a stimulant dangerously
15784: disturbing to his farming conservatism, which consisted in holding that
15785: whatever is, is bad, and any change is likely to be worse. He was
15786: flushed, and his eyes had a decidedly quarrelsome stare as he stood
15787: still grasping his pitchfork, while the landlord approached with his
15788: easy shuffling walk, one hand in his trouser-pocket and the other
15789: swinging round a thin walking-stick.
15790: 
15791: “Dagley, my good fellow,” began Mr. Brooke, conscious that he was going
15792: to be very friendly about the boy.
15793: 
15794: “Oh, ay, I’m a good feller, am I? Thank ye, sir, thank ye,” said
15795: Dagley, with a loud snarling irony which made Fag the sheep-dog stir
15796: from his seat and prick his ears; but seeing Monk enter the yard after
15797: some outside loitering, Fag seated himself again in an attitude of
15798: observation. “I’m glad to hear I’m a good feller.”
15799: 
15800: Mr. Brooke reflected that it was market-day, and that his worthy tenant
15801: had probably been dining, but saw no reason why he should not go on,
15802: since he could take the precaution of repeating what he had to say to
15803: Mrs. Dagley.
15804: 
15805: “Your little lad Jacob has been caught killing a leveret, Dagley: I
15806: have told Johnson to lock him up in the empty stable an hour or two,
15807: just to frighten him, you know. But he will be brought home by-and-by,
15808: before night: and you’ll just look after him, will you, and give him a
15809: reprimand, you know?”
15810: 
15811: “No, I woon’t: I’ll be dee’d if I’ll leather my boy to please you or
15812: anybody else, not if you was twenty landlords istid o’ one, and that a
15813: bad un.”
15814: 
15815: Dagley’s words were loud enough to summon his wife to the back-kitchen
15816: door—the only entrance ever used, and one always open except in bad
15817: weather—and Mr. Brooke, saying soothingly, “Well, well, I’ll speak to
15818: your wife—I didn’t mean beating, you know,” turned to walk to the
15819: house. But Dagley, only the more inclined to “have his say” with a
15820: gentleman who walked away from him, followed at once, with Fag
15821: slouching at his heels and sullenly evading some small and probably
15822: charitable advances on the part of Monk.
15823: 
15824: “How do you do, Mrs. Dagley?” said Mr. Brooke, making some haste. “I
15825: came to tell you about your boy: I don’t want you to give him the
15826: stick, you know.” He was careful to speak quite plainly this time.
15827: 
15828: Overworked Mrs. Dagley—a thin, worn woman, from whose life pleasure had
15829: so entirely vanished that she had not even any Sunday clothes which
15830: could give her satisfaction in preparing for church—had already had a
15831: misunderstanding with her husband since he had come home, and was in
15832: low spirits, expecting the worst. But her husband was beforehand in
15833: answering.
15834: 
15835: “No, nor he woon’t hev the stick, whether you want it or no,” pursued
15836: Dagley, throwing out his voice, as if he wanted it to hit hard. “You’ve
15837: got no call to come an’ talk about sticks o’ these primises, as you
15838: woon’t give a stick tow’rt mending. Go to Middlemarch to ax for _your_
15839: charrickter.”
15840: 
15841: “You’d far better hold your tongue, Dagley,” said the wife, “and not
15842: kick your own trough over. When a man as is father of a family has been
15843: an’ spent money at market and made himself the worse for liquor, he’s
15844: done enough mischief for one day. But I should like to know what my
15845: boy’s done, sir.”
15846: 
15847: “Niver do you mind what he’s done,” said Dagley, more fiercely, “it’s
15848: my business to speak, an’ not yourn. An’ I wull speak, too. I’ll hev my
15849: say—supper or no. An’ what I say is, as I’ve lived upo’ your ground
15850: from my father and grandfather afore me, an’ hev dropped our money
15851: into’t, an’ me an’ my children might lie an’ rot on the ground for
15852: top-dressin’ as we can’t find the money to buy, if the King wasn’t to
15853: put a stop.”
15854: 
15855: “My good fellow, you’re drunk, you know,” said Mr. Brooke,
15856: confidentially but not judiciously. “Another day, another day,” he
15857: added, turning as if to go.
15858: 
15859: But Dagley immediately fronted him, and Fag at his heels growled low,
15860: as his master’s voice grew louder and more insulting, while Monk also
15861: drew close in silent dignified watch. The laborers on the wagon were
15862: pausing to listen, and it seemed wiser to be quite passive than to
15863: attempt a ridiculous flight pursued by a bawling man.
15864: 
15865: “I’m no more drunk nor you are, nor so much,” said Dagley. “I can carry
15866: my liquor, an’ I know what I meean. An’ I meean as the King ’ull put a
15867: stop to ’t, for them say it as knows it, as there’s to be a Rinform,
15868: and them landlords as never done the right thing by their tenants ’ull
15869: be treated i’ that way as they’ll hev to scuttle off. An’ there’s them
15870: i’ Middlemarch knows what the Rinform is—an’ as knows who’ll hev to
15871: scuttle. Says they, ‘I know who _your_ landlord is.’ An’ says I, ‘I
15872: hope you’re the better for knowin’ him, I arn’t.’ Says they, ‘He’s a
15873: close-fisted un.’ ‘Ay ay,’ says I. ‘He’s a man for the Rinform,’ says
15874: they. That’s what they says. An’ I made out what the Rinform were—an’
15875: it were to send you an’ your likes a-scuttlin’ an’ wi’ pretty
15876: strong-smellin’ things too. An’ you may do as you like now, for I’m
15877: none afeard on you. An’ you’d better let my boy aloan, an’ look to
15878: yoursen, afore the Rinform has got upo’ your back. That’s what I’n got
15879: to say,” concluded Mr. Dagley, striking his fork into the ground with a
15880: firmness which proved inconvenient as he tried to draw it up again.
15881: 
15882: At this last action Monk began to bark loudly, and it was a moment for
15883: Mr. Brooke to escape. He walked out of the yard as quickly as he could,
15884: in some amazement at the novelty of his situation. He had never been
15885: insulted on his own land before, and had been inclined to regard
15886: himself as a general favorite (we are all apt to do so, when we think
15887: of our own amiability more than of what other people are likely to want
15888: of us). When he had quarrelled with Caleb Garth twelve years before he
15889: had thought that the tenants would be pleased at the landlord’s taking
15890: everything into his own hands.
15891: 
15892: Some who follow the narrative of his experience may wonder at the
15893: midnight darkness of Mr. Dagley; but nothing was easier in those times
15894: than for an hereditary farmer of his grade to be ignorant, in spite
15895: somehow of having a rector in the twin parish who was a gentleman to
15896: the backbone, a curate nearer at hand who preached more learnedly than
15897: the rector, a landlord who had gone into everything, especially fine
15898: art and social improvement, and all the lights of Middlemarch only
15899: three miles off. As to the facility with which mortals escape
15900: knowledge, try an average acquaintance in the intellectual blaze of
15901: London, and consider what that eligible person for a dinner-party would
15902: have been if he had learned scant skill in “summing” from the
15903: parish-clerk of Tipton, and read a chapter in the Bible with immense
15904: difficulty, because such names as Isaiah or Apollos remained
15905: unmanageable after twice spelling. Poor Dagley read a few verses
15906: sometimes on a Sunday evening, and the world was at least not darker to
15907: him than it had been before. Some things he knew thoroughly, namely,
15908: the slovenly habits of farming, and the awkwardness of weather, stock
15909: and crops, at Freeman’s End—so called apparently by way of sarcasm, to
15910: imply that a man was free to quit it if he chose, but that there was no
15911: earthly “beyond” open to him.
15912: 
15913: 
15914: 
15915: 
15916: CHAPTER XL.
15917: 
15918: Wise in his daily work was he:
15919:     To fruits of diligence,
15920: And not to faiths or polity,
15921:     He plied his utmost sense.
15922: These perfect in their little parts,
15923:     Whose work is all their prize—
15924: Without them how could laws, or arts,
15925:     Or towered cities rise?
15926: 
15927: 
15928: In watching effects, if only of an electric battery, it is often
15929: necessary to change our place and examine a particular mixture or group
15930: at some distance from the point where the movement we are interested in
15931: was set up. The group I am moving towards is at Caleb Garth’s
15932: breakfast-table in the large parlor where the maps and desk were:
15933: father, mother, and five of the children. Mary was just now at home
15934: waiting for a situation, while Christy, the boy next to her, was
15935: getting cheap learning and cheap fare in Scotland, having to his
15936: father’s disappointment taken to books instead of that sacred calling
15937: “business.”
15938: 
15939: The letters had come—nine costly letters, for which the postman had
15940: been paid three and twopence, and Mr. Garth was forgetting his tea and
15941: toast while he read his letters and laid them open one above the other,
15942: sometimes swaying his head slowly, sometimes screwing up his mouth in
15943: inward debate, but not forgetting to cut off a large red seal unbroken,
15944: which Letty snatched up like an eager terrier.
15945: 
15946: The talk among the rest went on unrestrainedly, for nothing disturbed
15947: Caleb’s absorption except shaking the table when he was writing.
15948: 
15949: Two letters of the nine had been for Mary. After reading them, she had
15950: passed them to her mother, and sat playing with her tea-spoon absently,
15951: till with a sudden recollection she returned to her sewing, which she
15952: had kept on her lap during breakfast.
15953: 
15954: “Oh, don’t sew, Mary!” said Ben, pulling her arm down. “Make me a
15955: peacock with this bread-crumb.” He had been kneading a small mass for
15956: the purpose.
15957: 
15958: “No, no, Mischief!” said Mary, good-humoredly, while she pricked his
15959: hand lightly with her needle. “Try and mould it yourself: you have seen
15960: me do it often enough. I must get this sewing done. It is for Rosamond
15961: Vincy: she is to be married next week, and she can’t be married without
15962: this handkerchief.” Mary ended merrily, amused with the last notion.
15963: 
15964: “Why can’t she, Mary?” said Letty, seriously interested in this
15965: mystery, and pushing her head so close to her sister that Mary now
15966: turned the threatening needle towards Letty’s nose.
15967: 
15968: “Because this is one of a dozen, and without it there would only be
15969: eleven,” said Mary, with a grave air of explanation, so that Letty sank
15970: back with a sense of knowledge.
15971: 
15972: “Have you made up your mind, my dear?” said Mrs. Garth, laying the
15973: letters down.
15974: 
15975: “I shall go to the school at York,” said Mary. “I am less unfit to
15976: teach in a school than in a family. I like to teach classes best. And,
15977: you see, I must teach: there is nothing else to be done.”
15978: 
15979: “Teaching seems to me the most delightful work in the world,” said Mrs.
15980: Garth, with a touch of rebuke in her tone. “I could understand your
15981: objection to it if you had not knowledge enough, Mary, or if you
15982: disliked children.”
15983: 
15984: “I suppose we never quite understand why another dislikes what we like,
15985: mother,” said Mary, rather curtly. “I am not fond of a schoolroom: I
15986: like the outside world better. It is a very inconvenient fault of
15987: mine.”
15988: 
15989: “It must be very stupid to be always in a girls’ school,” said Alfred.
15990: “Such a set of nincompoops, like Mrs. Ballard’s pupils walking two and
15991: two.”
15992: 
15993: “And they have no games worth playing at,” said Jim. “They can neither
15994: throw nor leap. I don’t wonder at Mary’s not liking it.”
15995: 
15996: “What is that Mary doesn’t like, eh?” said the father, looking over his
15997: spectacles and pausing before he opened his next letter.
15998: 
15999: “Being among a lot of nincompoop girls,” said Alfred.
16000: 
16001: “Is it the situation you had heard of, Mary?” said Caleb, gently,
16002: looking at his daughter.
16003: 
16004: “Yes, father: the school at York. I have determined to take it. It is
16005: quite the best. Thirty-five pounds a-year, and extra pay for teaching
16006: the smallest strummers at the piano.”
16007: 
16008: “Poor child! I wish she could stay at home with us, Susan,” said Caleb,
16009: looking plaintively at his wife.
16010: 
16011: “Mary would not be happy without doing her duty,” said Mrs. Garth,
16012: magisterially, conscious of having done her own.
16013: 
16014: “It wouldn’t make me happy to do such a nasty duty as that,” said
16015: Alfred—at which Mary and her father laughed silently, but Mrs. Garth
16016: said, gravely—
16017: 
16018: “Do find a fitter word than nasty, my dear Alfred, for everything that
16019: you think disagreeable. And suppose that Mary could help you to go to
16020: Mr. Hanmer’s with the money she gets?”
16021: 
16022: “That seems to me a great shame. But she’s an old brick,” said Alfred,
16023: rising from his chair, and pulling Mary’s head backward to kiss her.
16024: 
16025: Mary colored and laughed, but could not conceal that the tears were
16026: coming. Caleb, looking on over his spectacles, with the angles of his
16027: eyebrows falling, had an expression of mingled delight and sorrow as he
16028: returned to the opening of his letter; and even Mrs. Garth, her lips
16029: curling with a calm contentment, allowed that inappropriate language to
16030: pass without correction, although Ben immediately took it up, and sang,
16031: “She’s an old brick, old brick, old brick!” to a cantering measure,
16032: which he beat out with his fist on Mary’s arm.
16033: 
16034: But Mrs. Garth’s eyes were now drawn towards her husband, who was
16035: already deep in the letter he was reading. His face had an expression
16036: of grave surprise, which alarmed her a little, but he did not like to
16037: be questioned while he was reading, and she remained anxiously watching
16038: till she saw him suddenly shaken by a little joyous laugh as he turned
16039: back to the beginning of the letter, and looking at her above his
16040: spectacles, said, in a low tone, “What do you think, Susan?”
16041: 
16042: She went and stood behind him, putting her hand on his shoulder, while
16043: they read the letter together. It was from Sir James Chettam, offering
16044: to Mr. Garth the management of the family estates at Freshitt and
16045: elsewhere, and adding that Sir James had been requested by Mr. Brooke
16046: of Tipton to ascertain whether Mr. Garth would be disposed at the same
16047: time to resume the agency of the Tipton property. The Baronet added in
16048: very obliging words that he himself was particularly desirous of seeing
16049: the Freshitt and Tipton estates under the same management, and he hoped
16050: to be able to show that the double agency might be held on terms
16051: agreeable to Mr. Garth, whom he would be glad to see at the Hall at
16052: twelve o’clock on the following day.
16053: 
16054: “He writes handsomely, doesn’t he, Susan?” said Caleb, turning his eyes
16055: upward to his wife, who raised her hand from his shoulder to his ear,
16056: while she rested her chin on his head. “Brooke didn’t like to ask me
16057: himself, I can see,” he continued, laughing silently.
16058: 
16059: “Here is an honor to your father, children,” said Mrs. Garth, looking
16060: round at the five pair of eyes, all fixed on the parents. “He is asked
16061: to take a post again by those who dismissed him long ago. That shows
16062: that he did his work well, so that they feel the want of him.”
16063: 
16064: “Like Cincinnatus—hooray!” said Ben, riding on his chair, with a
16065: pleasant confidence that discipline was relaxed.
16066: 
16067: “Will they come to fetch him, mother?” said Letty, thinking of the
16068: Mayor and Corporation in their robes.
16069: 
16070: Mrs. Garth patted Letty’s head and smiled, but seeing that her husband
16071: was gathering up his letters and likely soon to be out of reach in that
16072: sanctuary “business,” she pressed his shoulder and said emphatically—
16073: 
16074: “Now, mind you ask fair pay, Caleb.”
16075: 
16076: “Oh yes,” said Caleb, in a deep voice of assent, as if it would be
16077: unreasonable to suppose anything else of him. “It’ll come to between
16078: four and five hundred, the two together.” Then with a little start of
16079: remembrance he said, “Mary, write and give up that school. Stay and
16080: help your mother. I’m as pleased as Punch, now I’ve thought of that.”
16081: 
16082: No manner could have been less like that of Punch triumphant than
16083: Caleb’s, but his talents did not lie in finding phrases, though he was
16084: very particular about his letter-writing, and regarded his wife as a
16085: treasury of correct language.
16086: 
16087: There was almost an uproar among the children now, and Mary held up the
16088: cambric embroidery towards her mother entreatingly, that it might be
16089: put out of reach while the boys dragged her into a dance. Mrs. Garth,
16090: in placid joy, began to put the cups and plates together, while Caleb
16091: pushing his chair from the table, as if he were going to move to the
16092: desk, still sat holding his letters in his hand and looking on the
16093: ground meditatively, stretching out the fingers of his left hand,
16094: according to a mute language of his own. At last he said—
16095: 
16096: “It’s a thousand pities Christy didn’t take to business, Susan. I shall
16097: want help by-and-by. And Alfred must go off to the engineering—I’ve
16098: made up my mind to that.” He fell into meditation and finger-rhetoric
16099: again for a little while, and then continued: “I shall make Brooke have
16100: new agreements with the tenants, and I shall draw up a rotation of
16101: crops. And I’ll lay a wager we can get fine bricks out of the clay at
16102: Bott’s corner. I must look into that: it would cheapen the repairs.
16103: It’s a fine bit of work, Susan! A man without a family would be glad to
16104: do it for nothing.”
16105: 
16106: “Mind you don’t, though,” said his wife, lifting up her finger.
16107: 
16108: “No, no; but it’s a fine thing to come to a man when he’s seen into the
16109: nature of business: to have the chance of getting a bit of the country
16110: into good fettle, as they say, and putting men into the right way with
16111: their farming, and getting a bit of good contriving and solid building
16112: done—that those who are living and those who come after will be the
16113: better for. I’d sooner have it than a fortune. I hold it the most
16114: honorable work that is.” Here Caleb laid down his letters, thrust his
16115: fingers between the buttons of his waistcoat, and sat upright, but
16116: presently proceeded with some awe in his voice and moving his head
16117: slowly aside—“It’s a great gift of God, Susan.”
16118: 
16119: “That it is, Caleb,” said his wife, with answering fervor. “And it will
16120: be a blessing to your children to have had a father who did such work:
16121: a father whose good work remains though his name may be forgotten.” She
16122: could not say any more to him then about the pay.
16123: 
16124: In the evening, when Caleb, rather tired with his day’s work, was
16125: seated in silence with his pocket-book open on his knee, while Mrs.
16126: Garth and Mary were at their sewing, and Letty in a corner was
16127: whispering a dialogue with her doll, Mr. Farebrother came up the
16128: orchard walk, dividing the bright August lights and shadows with the
16129: tufted grass and the apple-tree boughs. We know that he was fond of his
16130: parishioners the Garths, and had thought Mary worth mentioning to
16131: Lydgate. He used to the full the clergyman’s privilege of disregarding
16132: the Middlemarch discrimination of ranks, and always told his mother
16133: that Mrs. Garth was more of a lady than any matron in the town. Still,
16134: you see, he spent his evenings at the Vincys’, where the matron, though
16135: less of a lady, presided over a well-lit drawing-room and whist. In
16136: those days human intercourse was not determined solely by respect. But
16137: the Vicar did heartily respect the Garths, and a visit from him was no
16138: surprise to that family. Nevertheless he accounted for it even while he
16139: was shaking hands, by saying, “I come as an envoy, Mrs. Garth: I have
16140: something to say to you and Garth on behalf of Fred Vincy. The fact is,
16141: poor fellow,” he continued, as he seated himself and looked round with
16142: his bright glance at the three who were listening to him, “he has taken
16143: me into his confidence.”
16144: 
16145: Mary’s heart beat rather quickly: she wondered how far Fred’s
16146: confidence had gone.
16147: 
16148: “We haven’t seen the lad for months,” said Caleb. “I couldn’t think
16149: what was become of him.”
16150: 
16151: “He has been away on a visit,” said the Vicar, “because home was a
16152: little too hot for him, and Lydgate told his mother that the poor
16153: fellow must not begin to study yet. But yesterday he came and poured
16154: himself out to me. I am very glad he did, because I have seen him grow
16155: up from a youngster of fourteen, and I am so much at home in the house
16156: that the children are like nephews and nieces to me. But it is a
16157: difficult case to advise upon. However, he has asked me to come and
16158: tell you that he is going away, and that he is so miserable about his
16159: debt to you, and his inability to pay, that he can’t bear to come
16160: himself even to bid you good by.”
16161: 
16162: “Tell him it doesn’t signify a farthing,” said Caleb, waving his hand.
16163: “We’ve had the pinch and have got over it. And now I’m going to be as
16164: rich as a Jew.”
16165: 
16166: “Which means,” said Mrs. Garth, smiling at the Vicar, “that we are
16167: going to have enough to bring up the boys well and to keep Mary at
16168: home.”
16169: 
16170: “What is the treasure-trove?” said Mr. Farebrother.
16171: 
16172: “I’m going to be agent for two estates, Freshitt and Tipton; and
16173: perhaps for a pretty little bit of land in Lowick besides: it’s all the
16174: same family connection, and employment spreads like water if it’s once
16175: set going. It makes me very happy, Mr. Farebrother”—here Caleb threw
16176: back his head a little, and spread his arms on the elbows of his
16177: chair—“that I’ve got an opportunity again with the letting of the land,
16178: and carrying out a notion or two with improvements. It’s a most
16179: uncommonly cramping thing, as I’ve often told Susan, to sit on
16180: horseback and look over the hedges at the wrong thing, and not be able
16181: to put your hand to it to make it right. What people do who go into
16182: politics I can’t think: it drives me almost mad to see mismanagement
16183: over only a few hundred acres.”
16184: 
16185: It was seldom that Caleb volunteered so long a speech, but his
16186: happiness had the effect of mountain air: his eyes were bright, and the
16187: words came without effort.
16188: 
16189: “I congratulate you heartily, Garth,” said the Vicar. “This is the best
16190: sort of news I could have had to carry to Fred Vincy, for he dwelt a
16191: good deal on the injury he had done you in causing you to part with
16192: money—robbing you of it, he said—which you wanted for other purposes. I
16193: wish Fred were not such an idle dog; he has some very good points, and
16194: his father is a little hard upon him.”
16195: 
16196: “Where is he going?” said Mrs. Garth, rather coldly.
16197: 
16198: “He means to try again for his degree, and he is going up to study
16199: before term. I have advised him to do that. I don’t urge him to enter
16200: the Church—on the contrary. But if he will go and work so as to pass,
16201: that will be some guarantee that he has energy and a will; and he is
16202: quite at sea; he doesn’t know what else to do. So far he will please
16203: his father, and I have promised in the mean time to try and reconcile
16204: Vincy to his son’s adopting some other line of life. Fred says frankly
16205: he is not fit for a clergyman, and I would do anything I could to
16206: hinder a man from the fatal step of choosing the wrong profession. He
16207: quoted to me what you said, Miss Garth—do you remember it?” (Mr.
16208: Farebrother used to say “Mary” instead of “Miss Garth,” but it was part
16209: of his delicacy to treat her with the more deference because, according
16210: to Mrs. Vincy’s phrase, she worked for her bread.)
16211: 
16212: Mary felt uncomfortable, but, determined to take the matter lightly,
16213: answered at once, “I have said so many impertinent things to Fred—we
16214: are such old playfellows.”
16215: 
16216: “You said, according to him, that he would be one of those ridiculous
16217: clergymen who help to make the whole clergy ridiculous. Really, that
16218: was so cutting that I felt a little cut myself.”
16219: 
16220: Caleb laughed. “She gets her tongue from you, Susan,” he said, with
16221: some enjoyment.
16222: 
16223: “Not its flippancy, father,” said Mary, quickly, fearing that her
16224: mother would be displeased. “It is rather too bad of Fred to repeat my
16225: flippant speeches to Mr. Farebrother.”
16226: 
16227: “It was certainly a hasty speech, my dear,” said Mrs. Garth, with whom
16228: speaking evil of dignities was a high misdemeanor. “We should not value
16229: our Vicar the less because there was a ridiculous curate in the next
16230: parish.”
16231: 
16232: “There’s something in what she says, though,” said Caleb, not disposed
16233: to have Mary’s sharpness undervalued. “A bad workman of any sort makes
16234: his fellows mistrusted. Things hang together,” he added, looking on the
16235: floor and moving his feet uneasily with a sense that words were
16236: scantier than thoughts.
16237: 
16238: “Clearly,” said the Vicar, amused. “By being contemptible we set men’s
16239: minds to the tune of contempt. I certainly agree with Miss Garth’s view
16240: of the matter, whether I am condemned by it or not. But as to Fred
16241: Vincy, it is only fair he should be excused a little: old
16242: Featherstone’s delusive behavior did help to spoil him. There was
16243: something quite diabolical in not leaving him a farthing after all. But
16244: Fred has the good taste not to dwell on that. And what he cares most
16245: about is having offended you, Mrs. Garth; he supposes you will never
16246: think well of him again.”
16247: 
16248: “I have been disappointed in Fred,” said Mrs. Garth, with decision.
16249: “But I shall be ready to think well of him again when he gives me good
16250: reason to do so.”
16251: 
16252: At this point Mary went out of the room, taking Letty with her.
16253: 
16254: “Oh, we must forgive young people when they’re sorry,” said Caleb,
16255: watching Mary close the door. “And as you say, Mr. Farebrother, there
16256: was the very devil in that old man. Now Mary’s gone out, I must tell
16257: you a thing—it’s only known to Susan and me, and you’ll not tell it
16258: again. The old scoundrel wanted Mary to burn one of the wills the very
16259: night he died, when she was sitting up with him by herself, and he
16260: offered her a sum of money that he had in the box by him if she would
16261: do it. But Mary, you understand, could do no such thing—would not be
16262: handling his iron chest, and so on. Now, you see, the will he wanted
16263: burnt was this last, so that if Mary had done what he wanted, Fred
16264: Vincy would have had ten thousand pounds. The old man did turn to him
16265: at the last. That touches poor Mary close; she couldn’t help it—she was
16266: in the right to do what she did, but she feels, as she says, much as if
16267: she had knocked down somebody’s property and broken it against her
16268: will, when she was rightfully defending herself. I feel with her,
16269: somehow, and if I could make any amends to the poor lad, instead of
16270: bearing him a grudge for the harm he did us, I should be glad to do it.
16271: Now, what is your opinion, sir? Susan doesn’t agree with me; she
16272: says—tell what you say, Susan.”
16273: 
16274: “Mary could not have acted otherwise, even if she had known what would
16275: be the effect on Fred,” said Mrs. Garth, pausing from her work, and
16276: looking at Mr. Farebrother.
16277: 
16278: “And she was quite ignorant of it. It seems to me, a loss which falls
16279: on another because we have done right is not to lie upon our
16280: conscience.”
16281: 
16282: The Vicar did not answer immediately, and Caleb said, “It’s the
16283: feeling. The child feels in that way, and I feel with her. You don’t
16284: mean your horse to tread on a dog when you’re backing out of the way;
16285: but it goes through you, when it’s done.”
16286: 
16287: “I am sure Mrs. Garth would agree with you there,” said Mr.
16288: Farebrother, who for some reason seemed more inclined to ruminate than
16289: to speak. “One could hardly say that the feeling you mention about Fred
16290: is wrong—or rather, mistaken—though no man ought to make a claim on
16291: such feeling.”
16292: 
16293: “Well, well,” said Caleb, “it’s a secret. You will not tell Fred.”
16294: 
16295: “Certainly not. But I shall carry the other good news—that you can
16296: afford the loss he caused you.”
16297: 
16298: Mr. Farebrother left the house soon after, and seeing Mary in the
16299: orchard with Letty, went to say good-by to her. They made a pretty
16300: picture in the western light which brought out the brightness of the
16301: apples on the old scant-leaved boughs—Mary in her lavender gingham and
16302: black ribbons holding a basket, while Letty in her well-worn nankin
16303: picked up the fallen apples. If you want to know more particularly how
16304: Mary looked, ten to one you will see a face like hers in the crowded
16305: street to-morrow, if you are there on the watch: she will not be among
16306: those daughters of Zion who are haughty, and walk with stretched-out
16307: necks and wanton eyes, mincing as they go: let all those pass, and fix
16308: your eyes on some small plump brownish person of firm but quiet
16309: carriage, who looks about her, but does not suppose that anybody is
16310: looking at her. If she has a broad face and square brow, well-marked
16311: eyebrows and curly dark hair, a certain expression of amusement in her
16312: glance which her mouth keeps the secret of, and for the rest features
16313: entirely insignificant—take that ordinary but not disagreeable person
16314: for a portrait of Mary Garth. If you made her smile, she would show you
16315: perfect little teeth; if you made her angry, she would not raise her
16316: voice, but would probably say one of the bitterest things you have ever
16317: tasted the flavor of; if you did her a kindness, she would never forget
16318: it. Mary admired the keen-faced handsome little Vicar in his
16319: well-brushed threadbare clothes more than any man she had had the
16320: opportunity of knowing. She had never heard him say a foolish thing,
16321: though she knew that he did unwise ones; and perhaps foolish sayings
16322: were more objectionable to her than any of Mr. Farebrother’s unwise
16323: doings. At least, it was remarkable that the actual imperfections of
16324: the Vicar’s clerical character never seemed to call forth the same
16325: scorn and dislike which she showed beforehand for the predicted
16326: imperfections of the clerical character sustained by Fred Vincy. These
16327: irregularities of judgment, I imagine, are found even in riper minds
16328: than Mary Garth’s: our impartiality is kept for abstract merit and
16329: demerit, which none of us ever saw. Will any one guess towards which of
16330: those widely different men Mary had the peculiar woman’s
16331: tenderness?—the one she was most inclined to be severe on, or the
16332: contrary?
16333: 
16334: “Have you any message for your old playfellow, Miss Garth?” said the
16335: Vicar, as he took a fragrant apple from the basket which she held
16336: towards him, and put it in his pocket. “Something to soften down that
16337: harsh judgment? I am going straight to see him.”
16338: 
16339: “No,” said Mary, shaking her head, and smiling. “If I were to say that
16340: he would not be ridiculous as a clergyman, I must say that he would be
16341: something worse than ridiculous. But I am very glad to hear that he is
16342: going away to work.”
16343: 
16344: “On the other hand, I am very glad to hear that _you_ are not going
16345: away to work. My mother, I am sure, will be all the happier if you will
16346: come to see her at the vicarage: you know she is fond of having young
16347: people to talk to, and she has a great deal to tell about old times.
16348: You will really be doing a kindness.”
16349: 
16350: “I should like it very much, if I may,” said Mary. “Everything seems
16351: too happy for me all at once. I thought it would always be part of my
16352: life to long for home, and losing that grievance makes me feel rather
16353: empty: I suppose it served instead of sense to fill up my mind?”
16354: 
16355: “May I go with you, Mary?” whispered Letty—a most inconvenient child,
16356: who listened to everything. But she was made exultant by having her
16357: chin pinched and her cheek kissed by Mr. Farebrother—an incident which
16358: she narrated to her mother and father.
16359: 
16360: As the Vicar walked to Lowick, any one watching him closely might have
16361: seen him twice shrug his shoulders. I think that the rare Englishmen
16362: who have this gesture are never of the heavy type—for fear of any
16363: lumbering instance to the contrary, I will say, hardly ever; they have
16364: usually a fine temperament and much tolerance towards the smaller
16365: errors of men (themselves inclusive). The Vicar was holding an inward
16366: dialogue in which he told himself that there was probably something
16367: more between Fred and Mary Garth than the regard of old playfellows,
16368: and replied with a question whether that bit of womanhood were not a
16369: great deal too choice for that crude young gentleman. The rejoinder to
16370: this was the first shrug. Then he laughed at himself for being likely
16371: to have felt jealous, as if he had been a man able to marry, which,
16372: added he, it is as clear as any balance-sheet that I am not. Whereupon
16373: followed the second shrug.
16374: 
16375: What could two men, so different from each other, see in this “brown
16376: patch,” as Mary called herself? It was certainly not her plainness that
16377: attracted them (and let all plain young ladies be warned against the
16378: dangerous encouragement given them by Society to confide in their want
16379: of beauty). A human being in this aged nation of ours is a very
16380: wonderful whole, the slow creation of long interchanging influences:
16381: and charm is a result of two such wholes, the one loving and the one
16382: loved.
16383: 
16384: When Mr. and Mrs. Garth were sitting alone, Caleb said, “Susan, guess
16385: what I’m thinking of.”
16386: 
16387: “The rotation of crops,” said Mrs. Garth, smiling at him, above her
16388: knitting, “or else the back-doors of the Tipton cottages.”
16389: 
16390: “No,” said Caleb, gravely; “I am thinking that I could do a great turn
16391: for Fred Vincy. Christy’s gone, Alfred will be gone soon, and it will
16392: be five years before Jim is ready to take to business. I shall want
16393: help, and Fred might come in and learn the nature of things and act
16394: under me, and it might be the making of him into a useful man, if he
16395: gives up being a parson. What do you think?”
16396: 
16397: “I think, there is hardly anything honest that his family would object
16398: to more,” said Mrs. Garth, decidedly.
16399: 
16400: “What care I about their objecting?” said Caleb, with a sturdiness
16401: which he was apt to show when he had an opinion. “The lad is of age and
16402: must get his bread. He has sense enough and quickness enough; he likes
16403: being on the land, and it’s my belief that he could learn business well
16404: if he gave his mind to it.”
16405: 
16406: “But would he? His father and mother wanted him to be a fine gentleman,
16407: and I think he has the same sort of feeling himself. They all think us
16408: beneath them. And if the proposal came from you, I am sure Mrs. Vincy
16409: would say that we wanted Fred for Mary.”
16410: 
16411: “Life is a poor tale, if it is to be settled by nonsense of that sort,”
16412: said Caleb, with disgust.
16413: 
16414: “Yes, but there is a certain pride which is proper, Caleb.”
16415: 
16416: “I call it improper pride to let fools’ notions hinder you from doing a
16417: good action. There’s no sort of work,” said Caleb, with fervor, putting
16418: out his hand and moving it up and down to mark his emphasis, “that
16419: could ever be done well, if you minded what fools say. You must have it
16420: inside you that your plan is right, and that plan you must follow.”
16421: 
16422: “I will not oppose any plan you have set your mind on, Caleb,” said
16423: Mrs. Garth, who was a firm woman, but knew that there were some points
16424: on which her mild husband was yet firmer. “Still, it seems to be fixed
16425: that Fred is to go back to college: will it not be better to wait and
16426: see what he will choose to do after that? It is not easy to keep people
16427: against their will. And you are not yet quite sure enough of your own
16428: position, or what you will want.”
16429: 
16430: “Well, it may be better to wait a bit. But as to my getting plenty of
16431: work for two, I’m pretty sure of that. I’ve always had my hands full
16432: with scattered things, and there’s always something fresh turning up.
16433: Why, only yesterday—bless me, I don’t think I told you!—it was rather
16434: odd that two men should have been at me on different sides to do the
16435: same bit of valuing. And who do you think they were?” said Caleb,
16436: taking a pinch of snuff and holding it up between his fingers, as if it
16437: were a part of his exposition. He was fond of a pinch when it occurred
16438: to him, but he usually forgot that this indulgence was at his command.
16439: 
16440: His wife held down her knitting and looked attentive.
16441: 
16442: “Why, that Rigg, or Rigg Featherstone, was one. But Bulstrode was
16443: before him, so I’m going to do it for Bulstrode. Whether it’s mortgage
16444: or purchase they’re going for, I can’t tell yet.”
16445: 
16446: “Can that man be going to sell the land just left him—which he has
16447: taken the name for?” said Mrs. Garth.
16448: 
16449: “Deuce knows,” said Caleb, who never referred the knowledge of
16450: discreditable doings to any higher power than the deuce. “But Bulstrode
16451: has long been wanting to get a handsome bit of land under his
16452: fingers—that I know. And it’s a difficult matter to get, in this part
16453: of the country.”
16454: 
16455: Caleb scattered his snuff carefully instead of taking it, and then
16456: added, “The ins and outs of things are curious. Here is the land
16457: they’ve been all along expecting for Fred, which it seems the old man
16458: never meant to leave him a foot of, but left it to this side-slip of a
16459: son that he kept in the dark, and thought of his sticking there and
16460: vexing everybody as well as he could have vexed ’em himself if he could
16461: have kept alive. I say, it would be curious if it got into Bulstrode’s
16462: hands after all. The old man hated him, and never would bank with him.”
16463: 
16464: “What reason could the miserable creature have for hating a man whom he
16465: had nothing to do with?” said Mrs. Garth.
16466: 
16467: “Pooh! where’s the use of asking for such fellows’ reasons? The soul of
16468: man,” said Caleb, with the deep tone and grave shake of the head which
16469: always came when he used this phrase—“The soul of man, when it gets
16470: fairly rotten, will bear you all sorts of poisonous toad-stools, and no
16471: eye can see whence came the seed thereof.”
16472: 
16473: It was one of Caleb’s quaintnesses, that in his difficulty of finding
16474: speech for his thought, he caught, as it were, snatches of diction
16475: which he associated with various points of view or states of mind; and
16476: whenever he had a feeling of awe, he was haunted by a sense of Biblical
16477: phraseology, though he could hardly have given a strict quotation.

16481: 
16482: CHAPTER XLI.
16483: 
16484: By swaggering could I never thrive,
16485: For the rain it raineth every day.
16486: —_Twelfth Night_.
16487: 
16488: 
16489: The transactions referred to by Caleb Garth as having gone forward
16490: between Mr. Bulstrode and Mr. Joshua Rigg Featherstone concerning the
16491: land attached to Stone Court, had occasioned the interchange of a
16492: letter or two between these personages.
16493: 
16494: Who shall tell what may be the effect of writing? If it happens to have
16495: been cut in stone, though it lie face down-most for ages on a forsaken
16496: beach, or “rest quietly under the drums and tramplings of many
16497: conquests,” it may end by letting us into the secret of usurpations and
16498: other scandals gossiped about long empires ago:—this world being
16499: apparently a huge whispering-gallery. Such conditions are often
16500: minutely represented in our petty lifetimes. As the stone which has
16501: been kicked by generations of clowns may come by curious little links
16502: of effect under the eyes of a scholar, through whose labors it may at
16503: last fix the date of invasions and unlock religions, so a bit of ink
16504: and paper which has long been an innocent wrapping or stop-gap may at
16505: last be laid open under the one pair of eyes which have knowledge
16506: enough to turn it into the opening of a catastrophe. To Uriel watching
16507: the progress of planetary history from the sun, the one result would be
16508: just as much of a coincidence as the other.
16509: 
16510: Having made this rather lofty comparison I am less uneasy in calling
16511: attention to the existence of low people by whose interference, however
16512: little we may like it, the course of the world is very much determined.
16513: It would be well, certainly, if we could help to reduce their number,
16514: and something might perhaps be done by not lightly giving occasion to
16515: their existence. Socially speaking, Joshua Rigg would have been
16516: generally pronounced a superfluity. But those who like Peter
16517: Featherstone never had a copy of themselves demanded, are the very last
16518: to wait for such a request either in prose or verse. The copy in this
16519: case bore more of outside resemblance to the mother, in whose sex
16520: frog-features, accompanied with fresh-colored cheeks and a well-rounded
16521: figure, are compatible with much charm for a certain order of admirers.
16522: The result is sometimes a frog-faced male, desirable, surely, to no
16523: order of intelligent beings. Especially when he is suddenly brought
16524: into evidence to frustrate other people’s expectations—the very lowest
16525: aspect in which a social superfluity can present himself.
16526: 
16527: But Mr. Rigg Featherstone’s low characteristics were all of the sober,
16528: water-drinking kind. From the earliest to the latest hour of the day he
16529: was always as sleek, neat, and cool as the frog he resembled, and old
16530: Peter had secretly chuckled over an offshoot almost more calculating,
16531: and far more imperturbable, than himself. I will add that his
16532: finger-nails were scrupulously attended to, and that he meant to marry
16533: a well-educated young lady (as yet unspecified) whose person was good,
16534: and whose connections, in a solid middle-class way, were undeniable.
16535: Thus his nails and modesty were comparable to those of most gentlemen;
16536: though his ambition had been educated only by the opportunities of a
16537: clerk and accountant in the smaller commercial houses of a seaport. He
16538: thought the rural Featherstones very simple absurd people, and they in
16539: their turn regarded his “bringing up” in a seaport town as an
16540: exaggeration of the monstrosity that their brother Peter, and still
16541: more Peter’s property, should have had such belongings.
16542: 
16543: The garden and gravel approach, as seen from the two windows of the
16544: wainscoted parlor at Stone Court, were never in better trim than now,
16545: when Mr. Rigg Featherstone stood, with his hands behind him, looking
16546: out on these grounds as their master. But it seemed doubtful whether he
16547: looked out for the sake of contemplation or of turning his back to a
16548: person who stood in the middle of the room, with his legs considerably
16549: apart and his hands in his trouser-pockets: a person in all respects a
16550: contrast to the sleek and cool Rigg. He was a man obviously on the way
16551: towards sixty, very florid and hairy, with much gray in his bushy
16552: whiskers and thick curly hair, a stoutish body which showed to
16553: disadvantage the somewhat worn joinings of his clothes, and the air of
16554: a swaggerer, who would aim at being noticeable even at a show of
16555: fireworks, regarding his own remarks on any other person’s performance
16556: as likely to be more interesting than the performance itself.
16557: 
16558: His name was John Raffles, and he sometimes wrote jocosely W.A.G. after
16559: his signature, observing when he did so, that he was once taught by
16560: Leonard Lamb of Finsbury who wrote B.A. after his name, and that he,
16561: Raffles, originated the witticism of calling that celebrated principal
16562: Ba-Lamb. Such were the appearance and mental flavor of Mr. Raffles,
16563: both of which seemed to have a stale odor of travellers’ rooms in the
16564: commercial hotels of that period.
16565: 
16566: “Come, now, Josh,” he was saying, in a full rumbling tone, “look at it
16567: in this light: here is your poor mother going into the vale of years,
16568: and you could afford something handsome now to make her comfortable.”
16569: 
16570: “Not while you live. Nothing would make her comfortable while you
16571: live,” returned Rigg, in his cool high voice. “What I give her, you’ll
16572: take.”
16573: 
16574: “You bear me a grudge, Josh, that I know. But come, now—as between man
16575: and man—without humbug—a little capital might enable me to make a
16576: first-rate thing of the shop. The tobacco trade is growing. I should
16577: cut my own nose off in not doing the best I could at it. I should stick
16578: to it like a flea to a fleece for my own sake. I should always be on
16579: the spot. And nothing would make your poor mother so happy. I’ve pretty
16580: well done with my wild oats—turned fifty-five. I want to settle down in
16581: my chimney-corner. And if I once buckled to the tobacco trade, I could
16582: bring an amount of brains and experience to bear on it that would not
16583: be found elsewhere in a hurry. I don’t want to be bothering you one
16584: time after another, but to get things once for all into the right
16585: channel. Consider that, Josh—as between man and man—and with your poor
16586: mother to be made easy for her life. I was always fond of the old
16587: woman, by Jove!”
16588: 
16589: “Have you done?” said Mr. Rigg, quietly, without looking away from the
16590: window.
16591: 
16592: “Yes, _I_’ve done,” said Raffles, taking hold of his hat which stood
16593: before him on the table, and giving it a sort of oratorical push.
16594: 
16595: “Then just listen to me. The more you say anything, the less I shall
16596: believe it. The more you want me to do a thing, the more reason I shall
16597: have for never doing it. Do you think I mean to forget your kicking me
16598: when I was a lad, and eating all the best victual away from me and my
16599: mother? Do you think I forget your always coming home to sell and
16600: pocket everything, and going off again leaving us in the lurch? I
16601: should be glad to see you whipped at the cart-tail. My mother was a
16602: fool to you: she’d no right to give me a father-in-law, and she’s been
16603: punished for it. She shall have her weekly allowance paid and no more:
16604: and that shall be stopped if you dare to come on to these premises
16605: again, or to come into this country after me again. The next time you
16606: show yourself inside the gates here, you shall be driven off with the
16607: dogs and the wagoner’s whip.”
16608: 
16609: As Rigg pronounced the last words he turned round and looked at Raffles
16610: with his prominent frozen eyes. The contrast was as striking as it
16611: could have been eighteen years before, when Rigg was a most unengaging
16612: kickable boy, and Raffles was the rather thick-set Adonis of bar-rooms
16613: and back-parlors. But the advantage now was on the side of Rigg, and
16614: auditors of this conversation might probably have expected that Raffles
16615: would retire with the air of a defeated dog. Not at all. He made a
16616: grimace which was habitual with him whenever he was “out” in a game;
16617: then subsided into a laugh, and drew a brandy-flask from his pocket.
16618: 
16619: “Come, Josh,” he said, in a cajoling tone, “give us a spoonful of
16620: brandy, and a sovereign to pay the way back, and I’ll go. Honor bright!
16621: I’ll go like a bullet, _by_ Jove!”
16622: 
16623: “Mind,” said Rigg, drawing out a bunch of keys, “if I ever see you
16624: again, I shan’t speak to you. I don’t own you any more than if I saw a
16625: crow; and if you want to own me you’ll get nothing by it but a
16626: character for being what you are—a spiteful, brassy, bullying rogue.”
16627: 
16628: “That’s a pity, now, Josh,” said Raffles, affecting to scratch his head
16629: and wrinkle his brows upward as if he were nonplussed. “I’m very fond
16630: of you; _by_ Jove, I am! There’s nothing I like better than plaguing
16631: you—you’re so like your mother, and I must do without it. But the
16632: brandy and the sovereign’s a bargain.”
16633: 
16634: He jerked forward the flask and Rigg went to a fine old oaken bureau
16635: with his keys. But Raffles had reminded himself by his movement with
16636: the flask that it had become dangerously loose from its leather
16637: covering, and catching sight of a folded paper which had fallen within
16638: the fender, he took it up and shoved it under the leather so as to make
16639: the glass firm.
16640: 
16641: By that time Rigg came forward with a brandy-bottle, filled the flask,
16642: and handed Raffles a sovereign, neither looking at him nor speaking to
16643: him. After locking up the bureau again, he walked to the window and
16644: gazed out as impassibly as he had done at the beginning of the
16645: interview, while Raffles took a small allowance from the flask, screwed
16646: it up, and deposited it in his side-pocket, with provoking slowness,
16647: making a grimace at his stepson’s back.
16648: 
16649: “Farewell, Josh—and if forever!” said Raffles, turning back his head as
16650: he opened the door.
16651: 
16652: Rigg saw him leave the grounds and enter the lane. The gray day had
16653: turned to a light drizzling rain, which freshened the hedgerows and the
16654: grassy borders of the by-roads, and hastened the laborers who were
16655: loading the last shocks of corn. Raffles, walking with the uneasy gait
16656: of a town loiterer obliged to do a bit of country journeying on foot,
16657: looked as incongruous amid this moist rural quiet and industry as if he
16658: had been a baboon escaped from a menagerie. But there were none to
16659: stare at him except the long-weaned calves, and none to show dislike of
16660: his appearance except the little water-rats which rustled away at his
16661: approach.
16662: 
16663: He was fortunate enough when he got on to the highroad to be overtaken
16664: by the stage-coach, which carried him to Brassing; and there he took
16665: the new-made railway, observing to his fellow-passengers that he
16666: considered it pretty well seasoned now it had done for Huskisson. Mr.
16667: Raffles on most occasions kept up the sense of having been educated at
16668: an academy, and being able, if he chose, to pass well everywhere;
16669: indeed, there was not one of his fellow-men whom he did not feel
16670: himself in a position to ridicule and torment, confident of the
16671: entertainment which he thus gave to all the rest of the company.
16672: 
16673: He played this part now with as much spirit as if his journey had been
16674: entirely successful, resorting at frequent intervals to his flask. The
16675: paper with which he had wedged it was a letter signed _Nicholas
16676: Bulstrode_, but Raffles was not likely to disturb it from its present
16677: useful position.
16678:

16682: CHAPTER XLII.
16683: 
16684: How much, methinks, I could despise this man
16685: Were I not bound in charity against it!
16686: —SHAKESPEARE: _Henry VIII_.
16687: 
16688: 
16689: One of the professional calls made by Lydgate soon after his return
16690: from his wedding-journey was to Lowick Manor, in consequence of a
16691: letter which had requested him to fix a time for his visit.
16692: 
16693: Mr. Casaubon had never put any question concerning the nature of his
16694: illness to Lydgate, nor had he even to Dorothea betrayed any anxiety as
16695: to how far it might be likely to cut short his labors or his life. On
16696: this point, as on all others, he shrank from pity; and if the suspicion
16697: of being pitied for anything in his lot surmised or known in spite of
16698: himself was embittering, the idea of calling forth a show of compassion
16699: by frankly admitting an alarm or a sorrow was necessarily intolerable
16700: to him. Every proud mind knows something of this experience, and
16701: perhaps it is only to be overcome by a sense of fellowship deep enough
16702: to make all efforts at isolation seem mean and petty instead of
16703: exalting.
16704: 
16705: But Mr. Casaubon was now brooding over something through which the
16706: question of his health and life haunted his silence with a more
16707: harassing importunity even than through the autumnal unripeness of his
16708: authorship. It is true that this last might be called his central
16709: ambition; but there are some kinds of authorship in which by far the
16710: largest result is the uneasy susceptibility accumulated in the
16711: consciousness of the author—one knows of the river by a few streaks
16712: amid a long-gathered deposit of uncomfortable mud. That was the way
16713: with Mr. Casaubon’s hard intellectual labors. Their most characteristic
16714: result was not the “Key to all Mythologies,” but a morbid consciousness
16715: that others did not give him the place which he had not demonstrably
16716: merited—a perpetual suspicious conjecture that the views entertained of
16717: him were not to his advantage—a melancholy absence of passion in his
16718: efforts at achievement, and a passionate resistance to the confession
16719: that he had achieved nothing.
16720: 
16721: Thus his intellectual ambition which seemed to others to have absorbed
16722: and dried him, was really no security against wounds, least of all
16723: against those which came from Dorothea. And he had begun now to frame
16724: possibilities for the future which were somehow more embittering to him
16725: than anything his mind had dwelt on before.
16726: 
16727: Against certain facts he was helpless: against Will Ladislaw’s
16728: existence, his defiant stay in the neighborhood of Lowick, and his
16729: flippant state of mind with regard to the possessors of authentic,
16730: well-stamped erudition: against Dorothea’s nature, always taking on
16731: some new shape of ardent activity, and even in submission and silence
16732: covering fervid reasons which it was an irritation to think of: against
16733: certain notions and likings which had taken possession of her mind in
16734: relation to subjects that he could not possibly discuss with her. There
16735: was no denying that Dorothea was as virtuous and lovely a young lady as
16736: he could have obtained for a wife; but a young lady turned out to be
16737: something more troublesome than he had conceived. She nursed him, she
16738: read to him, she anticipated his wants, and was solicitous about his
16739: feelings; but there had entered into the husband’s mind the certainty
16740: that she judged him, and that her wifely devotedness was like a
16741: penitential expiation of unbelieving thoughts—was accompanied with a
16742: power of comparison by which himself and his doings were seen too
16743: luminously as a part of things in general. His discontent passed
16744: vapor-like through all her gentle loving manifestations, and clung to
16745: that inappreciative world which she had only brought nearer to him.
16746: 
16747: Poor Mr. Casaubon! This suffering was the harder to bear because it
16748: seemed like a betrayal: the young creature who had worshipped him with
16749: perfect trust had quickly turned into the critical wife; and early
16750: instances of criticism and resentment had made an impression which no
16751: tenderness and submission afterwards could remove. To his suspicious
16752: interpretation Dorothea’s silence now was a suppressed rebellion; a
16753: remark from her which he had not in any way anticipated was an
16754: assertion of conscious superiority; her gentle answers had an
16755: irritating cautiousness in them; and when she acquiesced it was a
16756: self-approved effort of forbearance. The tenacity with which he strove
16757: to hide this inward drama made it the more vivid for him; as we hear
16758: with the more keenness what we wish others not to hear.
16759: 
16760: Instead of wondering at this result of misery in Mr. Casaubon, I think
16761: it quite ordinary. Will not a tiny speck very close to our vision blot
16762: out the glory of the world, and leave only a margin by which we see the
16763: blot? I know no speck so troublesome as self. And who, if Mr. Casaubon
16764: had chosen to expound his discontents—his suspicions that he was not
16765: any longer adored without criticism—could have denied that they were
16766: founded on good reasons? On the contrary, there was a strong reason to
16767: be added, which he had not himself taken explicitly into
16768: account—namely, that he was not unmixedly adorable. He suspected this,
16769: however, as he suspected other things, without confessing it, and like
16770: the rest of us, felt how soothing it would have been to have a
16771: companion who would never find it out.
16772: 
16773: This sore susceptibility in relation to Dorothea was thoroughly
16774: prepared before Will Ladislaw had returned to Lowick, and what had
16775: occurred since then had brought Mr. Casaubon’s power of suspicious
16776: construction into exasperated activity. To all the facts which he knew,
16777: he added imaginary facts both present and future which became more real
16778: to him than those because they called up a stronger dislike, a more
16779: predominating bitterness. Suspicion and jealousy of Will Ladislaw’s
16780: intentions, suspicion and jealousy of Dorothea’s impressions, were
16781: constantly at their weaving work. It would be quite unjust to him to
16782: suppose that he could have entered into any coarse misinterpretation of
16783: Dorothea: his own habits of mind and conduct, quite as much as the open
16784: elevation of her nature, saved him from any such mistake. What he was
16785: jealous of was her opinion, the sway that might be given to her ardent
16786: mind in its judgments, and the future possibilities to which these
16787: might lead her. As to Will, though until his last defiant letter he had
16788: nothing definite which he would choose formally to allege against him,
16789: he felt himself warranted in believing that he was capable of any
16790: design which could fascinate a rebellious temper and an undisciplined
16791: impulsiveness. He was quite sure that Dorothea was the cause of Will’s
16792: return from Rome, and his determination to settle in the neighborhood;
16793: and he was penetrating enough to imagine that Dorothea had innocently
16794: encouraged this course. It was as clear as possible that she was ready
16795: to be attached to Will and to be pliant to his suggestions: they had
16796: never had a _tête-à-tête_ without her bringing away from it some new
16797: troublesome impression, and the last interview that Mr. Casaubon was
16798: aware of (Dorothea, on returning from Freshitt Hall, had for the first
16799: time been silent about having seen Will) had led to a scene which
16800: roused an angrier feeling against them both than he had ever known
16801: before. Dorothea’s outpouring of her notions about money, in the
16802: darkness of the night, had done nothing but bring a mixture of more
16803: odious foreboding into her husband’s mind.
16804: 
16805: And there was the shock lately given to his health always sadly present
16806: with him. He was certainly much revived; he had recovered all his usual
16807: power of work: the illness might have been mere fatigue, and there
16808: might still be twenty years of achievement before him, which would
16809: justify the thirty years of preparation. That prospect was made the
16810: sweeter by a flavor of vengeance against the hasty sneers of Carp &
16811: Company; for even when Mr. Casaubon was carrying his taper among the
16812: tombs of the past, those modern figures came athwart the dim light, and
16813: interrupted his diligent exploration. To convince Carp of his mistake,
16814: so that he would have to eat his own words with a good deal of
16815: indigestion, would be an agreeable accident of triumphant authorship,
16816: which the prospect of living to future ages on earth and to all
16817: eternity in heaven could not exclude from contemplation. Since, thus,
16818: the prevision of his own unending bliss could not nullify the bitter
16819: savors of irritated jealousy and vindictiveness, it is the less
16820: surprising that the probability of a transient earthly bliss for other
16821: persons, when he himself should have entered into glory, had not a
16822: potently sweetening effect. If the truth should be that some
16823: undermining disease was at work within him, there might be large
16824: opportunity for some people to be the happier when he was gone; and if
16825: one of those people should be Will Ladislaw, Mr. Casaubon objected so
16826: strongly that it seemed as if the annoyance would make part of his
16827: disembodied existence.
16828: 
16829: This is a very bare and therefore a very incomplete way of putting the
16830: case. The human soul moves in many channels, and Mr. Casaubon, we know,
16831: had a sense of rectitude and an honorable pride in satisfying the
16832: requirements of honor, which compelled him to find other reasons for
16833: his conduct than those of jealousy and vindictiveness. The way in which
16834: Mr. Casaubon put the case was this:—“In marrying Dorothea Brooke I had
16835: to care for her well-being in case of my death. But well-being is not
16836: to be secured by ample, independent possession of property; on the
16837: contrary, occasions might arise in which such possession might expose
16838: her to the more danger. She is ready prey to any man who knows how to
16839: play adroitly either on her affectionate ardor or her Quixotic
16840: enthusiasm; and a man stands by with that very intention in his mind—a
16841: man with no other principle than transient caprice, and who has a
16842: personal animosity towards me—I am sure of it—an animosity which is fed
16843: by the consciousness of his ingratitude, and which he has constantly
16844: vented in ridicule of which I am as well assured as if I had heard it.
16845: Even if I live I shall not be without uneasiness as to what he may
16846: attempt through indirect influence. This man has gained Dorothea’s ear:
16847: he has fascinated her attention; he has evidently tried to impress her
16848: mind with the notion that he has claims beyond anything I have done for
16849: him. If I die—and he is waiting here on the watch for that—he will
16850: persuade her to marry him. That would be calamity for her and success
16851: for him. _She_ would not think it calamity: he would make her believe
16852: anything; she has a tendency to immoderate attachment which she
16853: inwardly reproaches me for not responding to, and already her mind is
16854: occupied with his fortunes. He thinks of an easy conquest and of
16855: entering into my nest. That I will hinder! Such a marriage would be
16856: fatal to Dorothea. Has he ever persisted in anything except from
16857: contradiction? In knowledge he has always tried to be showy at small
16858: cost. In religion he could be, as long as it suited him, the facile
16859: echo of Dorothea’s vagaries. When was sciolism ever dissociated from
16860: laxity? I utterly distrust his morals, and it is my duty to hinder to
16861: the utmost the fulfilment of his designs.”
16862: 
16863: The arrangements made by Mr. Casaubon on his marriage left strong
16864: measures open to him, but in ruminating on them his mind inevitably
16865: dwelt so much on the probabilities of his own life that the longing to
16866: get the nearest possible calculation had at last overcome his proud
16867: reticence, and had determined him to ask Lydgate’s opinion as to the
16868: nature of his illness.
16869: 
16870: He had mentioned to Dorothea that Lydgate was coming by appointment at
16871: half-past three, and in answer to her anxious question, whether he had
16872: felt ill, replied,—“No, I merely wish to have his opinion concerning
16873: some habitual symptoms. You need not see him, my dear. I shall give
16874: orders that he may be sent to me in the Yew-tree Walk, where I shall be
16875: taking my usual exercise.”
16876: 
16877: When Lydgate entered the Yew-tree Walk he saw Mr. Casaubon slowly
16878: receding with his hands behind him according to his habit, and his head
16879: bent forward. It was a lovely afternoon; the leaves from the lofty
16880: limes were falling silently across the sombre evergreens, while the
16881: lights and shadows slept side by side: there was no sound but the
16882: cawing of the rooks, which to the accustomed ear is a lullaby, or that
16883: last solemn lullaby, a dirge. Lydgate, conscious of an energetic frame
16884: in its prime, felt some compassion when the figure which he was likely
16885: soon to overtake turned round, and in advancing towards him showed more
16886: markedly than ever the signs of premature age—the student’s bent
16887: shoulders, the emaciated limbs, and the melancholy lines of the mouth.
16888: “Poor fellow,” he thought, “some men with his years are like lions; one
16889: can tell nothing of their age except that they are full grown.”
16890: 
16891: “Mr. Lydgate,” said Mr. Casaubon, with his invariably polite air, “I am
16892: exceedingly obliged to you for your punctuality. We will, if you
16893: please, carry on our conversation in walking to and fro.”
16894: 
16895: “I hope your wish to see me is not due to the return of unpleasant
16896: symptoms,” said Lydgate, filling up a pause.
16897: 
16898: “Not immediately—no. In order to account for that wish I must
16899: mention—what it were otherwise needless to refer to—that my life, on
16900: all collateral accounts insignificant, derives a possible importance
16901: from the incompleteness of labors which have extended through all its
16902: best years. In short, I have long had on hand a work which I would fain
16903: leave behind me in such a state, at least, that it might be committed
16904: to the press by—others. Were I assured that this is the utmost I can
16905: reasonably expect, that assurance would be a useful circumscription of
16906: my attempts, and a guide in both the positive and negative
16907: determination of my course.”
16908: 
16909: Here Mr. Casaubon paused, removed one hand from his back and thrust it
16910: between the buttons of his single-breasted coat. To a mind largely
16911: instructed in the human destiny hardly anything could be more
16912: interesting than the inward conflict implied in his formal measured
16913: address, delivered with the usual sing-song and motion of the head.
16914: Nay, are there many situations more sublimely tragic than the struggle
16915: of the soul with the demand to renounce a work which has been all the
16916: significance of its life—a significance which is to vanish as the
16917: waters which come and go where no man has need of them? But there was
16918: nothing to strike others as sublime about Mr. Casaubon, and Lydgate,
16919: who had some contempt at hand for futile scholarship, felt a little
16920: amusement mingling with his pity. He was at present too ill acquainted
16921: with disaster to enter into the pathos of a lot where everything is
16922: below the level of tragedy except the passionate egoism of the
16923: sufferer.
16924: 
16925: “You refer to the possible hindrances from want of health?” he said,
16926: wishing to help forward Mr. Casaubon’s purpose, which seemed to be
16927: clogged by some hesitation.
16928: 
16929: “I do. You have not implied to me that the symptoms which—I am bound to
16930: testify—you watched with scrupulous care, were those of a fatal
16931: disease. But were it so, Mr. Lydgate, I should desire to know the truth
16932: without reservation, and I appeal to you for an exact statement of your
16933: conclusions: I request it as a friendly service. If you can tell me
16934: that my life is not threatened by anything else than ordinary
16935: casualties, I shall rejoice, on grounds which I have already indicated.
16936: If not, knowledge of the truth is even more important to me.”
16937: 
16938: “Then I can no longer hesitate as to my course,” said Lydgate; “but the
16939: first thing I must impress on you is that my conclusions are doubly
16940: uncertain—uncertain not only because of my fallibility, but because
16941: diseases of the heart are eminently difficult to found predictions on.
16942: In any case, one can hardly increase appreciably the tremendous
16943: uncertainty of life.”
16944: 
16945: Mr. Casaubon winced perceptibly, but bowed.
16946: 
16947: “I believe that you are suffering from what is called fatty
16948: degeneration of the heart, a disease which was first divined and
16949: explored by Laennec, the man who gave us the stethoscope, not so very
16950: many years ago. A good deal of experience—a more lengthened
16951: observation—is wanting on the subject. But after what you have said, it
16952: is my duty to tell you that death from this disease is often sudden. At
16953: the same time, no such result can be predicted. Your condition may be
16954: consistent with a tolerably comfortable life for another fifteen years,
16955: or even more. I could add no information to this beyond anatomical or
16956: medical details, which would leave expectation at precisely the same
16957: point.” Lydgate’s instinct was fine enough to tell him that plain
16958: speech, quite free from ostentatious caution, would be felt by Mr.
16959: Casaubon as a tribute of respect.
16960: 
16961: “I thank you, Mr. Lydgate,” said Mr. Casaubon, after a moment’s pause.
16962: “One thing more I have still to ask: did you communicate what you have
16963: now told me to Mrs. Casaubon?”
16964: 
16965: “Partly—I mean, as to the possible issues.” Lydgate was going to
16966: explain why he had told Dorothea, but Mr. Casaubon, with an
16967: unmistakable desire to end the conversation, waved his hand slightly,
16968: and said again, “I thank you,” proceeding to remark on the rare beauty
16969: of the day.
16970: 
16971: Lydgate, certain that his patient wished to be alone, soon left him;
16972: and the black figure with hands behind and head bent forward continued
16973: to pace the walk where the dark yew-trees gave him a mute companionship
16974: in melancholy, and the little shadows of bird or leaf that fleeted
16975: across the isles of sunlight, stole along in silence as in the presence
16976: of a sorrow. Here was a man who now for the first time found himself
16977: looking into the eyes of death—who was passing through one of those
16978: rare moments of experience when we feel the truth of a commonplace,
16979: which is as different from what we call knowing it, as the vision of
16980: waters upon the earth is different from the delirious vision of the
16981: water which cannot be had to cool the burning tongue. When the
16982: commonplace “We must all die” transforms itself suddenly into the acute
16983: consciousness “I must die—and soon,” then death grapples us, and his
16984: fingers are cruel; afterwards, he may come to fold us in his arms as
16985: our mother did, and our last moment of dim earthly discerning may be
16986: like the first. To Mr. Casaubon now, it was as if he suddenly found
16987: himself on the dark river-brink and heard the plash of the oncoming
16988: oar, not discerning the forms, but expecting the summons. In such an
16989: hour the mind does not change its lifelong bias, but carries it onward
16990: in imagination to the other side of death, gazing backward—perhaps with
16991: the divine calm of beneficence, perhaps with the petty anxieties of
16992: self-assertion. What was Mr. Casaubon’s bias his acts will give us a
16993: clew to. He held himself to be, with some private scholarly
16994: reservations, a believing Christian, as to estimates of the present and
16995: hopes of the future. But what we strive to gratify, though we may call
16996: it a distant hope, is an immediate desire: the future estate for which
16997: men drudge up city alleys exists already in their imagination and love.
16998: And Mr. Casaubon’s immediate desire was not for divine communion and
16999: light divested of earthly conditions; his passionate longings, poor
17000: man, clung low and mist-like in very shady places.
17001: 
17002: Dorothea had been aware when Lydgate had ridden away, and she had
17003: stepped into the garden, with the impulse to go at once to her husband.
17004: But she hesitated, fearing to offend him by obtruding herself; for her
17005: ardor, continually repulsed, served, with her intense memory, to
17006: heighten her dread, as thwarted energy subsides into a shudder; and she
17007: wandered slowly round the nearer clumps of trees until she saw him
17008: advancing. Then she went towards him, and might have represented a
17009: heaven-sent angel coming with a promise that the short hours remaining
17010: should yet be filled with that faithful love which clings the closer to
17011: a comprehended grief. His glance in reply to hers was so chill that she
17012: felt her timidity increased; yet she turned and passed her hand through
17013: his arm.
17014: 
17015: Mr. Casaubon kept his hands behind him and allowed her pliant arm to
17016: cling with difficulty against his rigid arm.
17017: 
17018: There was something horrible to Dorothea in the sensation which this
17019: unresponsive hardness inflicted on her. That is a strong word, but not
17020: too strong: it is in these acts called trivialities that the seeds of
17021: joy are forever wasted, until men and women look round with haggard
17022: faces at the devastation their own waste has made, and say, the earth
17023: bears no harvest of sweetness—calling their denial knowledge. You may
17024: ask why, in the name of manliness, Mr. Casaubon should have behaved in
17025: that way. Consider that his was a mind which shrank from pity: have you
17026: ever watched in such a mind the effect of a suspicion that what is
17027: pressing it as a grief may be really a source of contentment, either
17028: actual or future, to the being who already offends by pitying? Besides,
17029: he knew little of Dorothea’s sensations, and had not reflected that on
17030: such an occasion as the present they were comparable in strength to his
17031: own sensibilities about Carp’s criticisms.
17032: 
17033: Dorothea did not withdraw her arm, but she could not venture to speak.
17034: Mr. Casaubon did not say, “I wish to be alone,” but he directed his
17035: steps in silence towards the house, and as they entered by the glass
17036: door on this eastern side, Dorothea withdrew her arm and lingered on
17037: the matting, that she might leave her husband quite free. He entered
17038: the library and shut himself in, alone with his sorrow.
17039: 
17040: She went up to her boudoir. The open bow-window let in the serene glory
17041: of the afternoon lying in the avenue, where the lime-trees cast long
17042: shadows. But Dorothea knew nothing of the scene. She threw herself on a
17043: chair, not heeding that she was in the dazzling sun-rays: if there were
17044: discomfort in that, how could she tell that it was not part of her
17045: inward misery?
17046: 
17047: She was in the reaction of a rebellious anger stronger than any she had
17048: felt since her marriage. Instead of tears there came words:—
17049: 
17050: “What have I done—what am I—that he should treat me so? He never knows
17051: what is in my mind—he never cares. What is the use of anything I do? He
17052: wishes he had never married me.”
17053: 
17054: She began to hear herself, and was checked into stillness. Like one who
17055: has lost his way and is weary, she sat and saw as in one glance all the
17056: paths of her young hope which she should never find again. And just as
17057: clearly in the miserable light she saw her own and her husband’s
17058: solitude—how they walked apart so that she was obliged to survey him.
17059: If he had drawn her towards him, she would never have surveyed
17060: him—never have said, “Is he worth living for?” but would have felt him
17061: simply a part of her own life. Now she said bitterly, “It is his fault,
17062: not mine.” In the jar of her whole being, Pity was overthrown. Was it
17063: her fault that she had believed in him—had believed in his
17064: worthiness?—And what, exactly, was he?— She was able enough to estimate
17065: him—she who waited on his glances with trembling, and shut her best
17066: soul in prison, paying it only hidden visits, that she might be petty
17067: enough to please him. In such a crisis as this, some women begin to
17068: hate.
17069: 
17070: The sun was low when Dorothea was thinking that she would not go down
17071: again, but would send a message to her husband saying that she was not
17072: well and preferred remaining up-stairs. She had never deliberately
17073: allowed her resentment to govern her in this way before, but she
17074: believed now that she could not see him again without telling him the
17075: truth about her feeling, and she must wait till she could do it without
17076: interruption. He might wonder and be hurt at her message. It was good
17077: that he should wonder and be hurt. Her anger said, as anger is apt to
17078: say, that God was with her—that all heaven, though it were crowded with
17079: spirits watching them, must be on her side. She had determined to ring
17080: her bell, when there came a rap at the door.
17081: 
17082: Mr. Casaubon had sent to say that he would have his dinner in the
17083: library. He wished to be quite alone this evening, being much occupied.
17084: 
17085: “I shall not dine, then, Tantripp.”
17086: 
17087: “Oh, madam, let me bring you a little something?”
17088: 
17089: “No; I am not well. Get everything ready in my dressing room, but pray
17090: do not disturb me again.”
17091: 
17092: Dorothea sat almost motionless in her meditative struggle, while the
17093: evening slowly deepened into night. But the struggle changed
17094: continually, as that of a man who begins with a movement towards
17095: striking and ends with conquering his desire to strike. The energy that
17096: would animate a crime is not more than is wanted to inspire a resolved
17097: submission, when the noble habit of the soul reasserts itself. That
17098: thought with which Dorothea had gone out to meet her husband—her
17099: conviction that he had been asking about the possible arrest of all his
17100: work, and that the answer must have wrung his heart, could not be long
17101: without rising beside the image of him, like a shadowy monitor looking
17102: at her anger with sad remonstrance. It cost her a litany of pictured
17103: sorrows and of silent cries that she might be the mercy for those
17104: sorrows—but the resolved submission did come; and when the house was
17105: still, and she knew that it was near the time when Mr. Casaubon
17106: habitually went to rest, she opened her door gently and stood outside
17107: in the darkness waiting for his coming up-stairs with a light in his
17108: hand. If he did not come soon she thought that she would go down and
17109: even risk incurring another pang. She would never again expect anything
17110: else. But she did hear the library door open, and slowly the light
17111: advanced up the staircase without noise from the footsteps on the
17112: carpet. When her husband stood opposite to her, she saw that his face
17113: was more haggard. He started slightly on seeing her, and she looked up
17114: at him beseechingly, without speaking.
17115: 
17116: “Dorothea!” he said, with a gentle surprise in his tone. “Were you
17117: waiting for me?”
17118: 
17119: “Yes, I did not like to disturb you.”
17120: 
17121: “Come, my dear, come. You are young, and need not to extend your life
17122: by watching.”
17123: 
17124: When the kind quiet melancholy of that speech fell on Dorothea’s ears,
17125: she felt something like the thankfulness that might well up in us if we
17126: had narrowly escaped hurting a lamed creature. She put her hand into
17127: her husband’s, and they went along the broad corridor together.

17136: 
17137: 
17138: CHAPTER XLIII.
17139: 
17140: “This figure hath high price: ’t was wrought with love
17141: Ages ago in finest ivory;
17142: Nought modish in it, pure and noble lines
17143: Of generous womanhood that fits all time
17144: That too is costly ware; majolica
17145: Of deft design, to please a lordly eye:
17146: The smile, you see, is perfect—wonderful
17147: As mere Faience! a table ornament
17148: To suit the richest mounting.”
17149: 
17150: 
17151: Dorothea seldom left home without her husband, but she did occasionally
17152: drive into Middlemarch alone, on little errands of shopping or charity
17153: such as occur to every lady of any wealth when she lives within three
17154: miles of a town. Two days after that scene in the Yew-tree Walk, she
17155: determined to use such an opportunity in order if possible to see
17156: Lydgate, and learn from him whether her husband had really felt any
17157: depressing change of symptoms which he was concealing from her, and
17158: whether he had insisted on knowing the utmost about himself. She felt
17159: almost guilty in asking for knowledge about him from another, but the
17160: dread of being without it—the dread of that ignorance which would make
17161: her unjust or hard—overcame every scruple. That there had been some
17162: crisis in her husband’s mind she was certain: he had the very next day
17163: begun a new method of arranging his notes, and had associated her quite
17164: newly in carrying out his plan. Poor Dorothea needed to lay up stores
17165: of patience.
17166: 
17167: It was about four o’clock when she drove to Lydgate’s house in Lowick
17168: Gate, wishing, in her immediate doubt of finding him at home, that she
17169: had written beforehand. And he was not at home.
17170: 
17171: “Is Mrs. Lydgate at home?” said Dorothea, who had never, that she knew
17172: of, seen Rosamond, but now remembered the fact of the marriage. Yes,
17173: Mrs. Lydgate was at home.
17174: 
17175: “I will go in and speak to her, if she will allow me. Will you ask her
17176: if she can see me—see Mrs. Casaubon, for a few minutes?”
17177: 
17178: When the servant had gone to deliver that message, Dorothea could hear
17179: sounds of music through an open window—a few notes from a man’s voice
17180: and then a piano bursting into roulades. But the roulades broke off
17181: suddenly, and then the servant came back saying that Mrs. Lydgate would
17182: be happy to see Mrs. Casaubon.
17183: 
17184: When the drawing-room door opened and Dorothea entered, there was a
17185: sort of contrast not infrequent in country life when the habits of the
17186: different ranks were less blent than now. Let those who know, tell us
17187: exactly what stuff it was that Dorothea wore in those days of mild
17188: autumn—that thin white woollen stuff soft to the touch and soft to the
17189: eye. It always seemed to have been lately washed, and to smell of the
17190: sweet hedges—was always in the shape of a pelisse with sleeves hanging
17191: all out of the fashion. Yet if she had entered before a still audience
17192: as Imogene or Cato’s daughter, the dress might have seemed right
17193: enough: the grace and dignity were in her limbs and neck; and about her
17194: simply parted hair and candid eyes the large round poke which was then
17195: in the fate of women, seemed no more odd as a head-dress than the gold
17196: trencher we call a halo. By the present audience of two persons, no
17197: dramatic heroine could have been expected with more interest than Mrs.
17198: Casaubon. To Rosamond she was one of those county divinities not mixing
17199: with Middlemarch mortality, whose slightest marks of manner or
17200: appearance were worthy of her study; moreover, Rosamond was not without
17201: satisfaction that Mrs. Casaubon should have an opportunity of studying
17202: _her_. What is the use of being exquisite if you are not seen by the
17203: best judges? and since Rosamond had received the highest compliments at
17204: Sir Godwin Lydgate’s, she felt quite confident of the impression she
17205: must make on people of good birth. Dorothea put out her hand with her
17206: usual simple kindness, and looked admiringly at Lydgate’s lovely
17207: bride—aware that there was a gentleman standing at a distance, but
17208: seeing him merely as a coated figure at a wide angle. The gentleman was
17209: too much occupied with the presence of the one woman to reflect on the
17210: contrast between the two—a contrast that would certainly have been
17211: striking to a calm observer. They were both tall, and their eyes were
17212: on a level; but imagine Rosamond’s infantine blondness and wondrous
17213: crown of hair-plaits, with her pale-blue dress of a fit and fashion so
17214: perfect that no dressmaker could look at it without emotion, a large
17215: embroidered collar which it was to be hoped all beholders would know
17216: the price of, her small hands duly set off with rings, and that
17217: controlled self-consciousness of manner which is the expensive
17218: substitute for simplicity.
17219: 
17220: “Thank you very much for allowing me to interrupt you,” said Dorothea,
17221: immediately. “I am anxious to see Mr. Lydgate, if possible, before I go
17222: home, and I hoped that you might possibly tell me where I could find
17223: him, or even allow me to wait for him, if you expect him soon.”
17224: 
17225: “He is at the New Hospital,” said Rosamond; “I am not sure how soon he
17226: will come home. But I can send for him.”
17227: 
17228: “Will you let me go and fetch him?” said Will Ladislaw, coming forward.
17229: He had already taken up his hat before Dorothea entered. She colored
17230: with surprise, but put out her hand with a smile of unmistakable
17231: pleasure, saying—
17232: 
17233: “I did not know it was you: I had no thought of seeing you here.”
17234: 
17235: “May I go to the Hospital and tell Mr. Lydgate that you wish to see
17236: him?” said Will.
17237: 
17238: “It would be quicker to send the carriage for him,” said Dorothea, “if
17239: you will be kind enough to give the message to the coachman.”
17240: 
17241: Will was moving to the door when Dorothea, whose mind had flashed in an
17242: instant over many connected memories, turned quickly and said, “I will
17243: go myself, thank you. I wish to lose no time before getting home again.
17244: I will drive to the Hospital and see Mr. Lydgate there. Pray excuse me,
17245: Mrs. Lydgate. I am very much obliged to you.”
17246: 
17247: Her mind was evidently arrested by some sudden thought, and she left
17248: the room hardly conscious of what was immediately around her—hardly
17249: conscious that Will opened the door for her and offered her his arm to
17250: lead her to the carriage. She took the arm but said nothing. Will was
17251: feeling rather vexed and miserable, and found nothing to say on his
17252: side. He handed her into the carriage in silence, they said good-by,
17253: and Dorothea drove away.
17254: 
17255: In the five minutes’ drive to the Hospital she had time for some
17256: reflections that were quite new to her. Her decision to go, and her
17257: preoccupation in leaving the room, had come from the sudden sense that
17258: there would be a sort of deception in her voluntarily allowing any
17259: further intercourse between herself and Will which she was unable to
17260: mention to her husband, and already her errand in seeking Lydgate was a
17261: matter of concealment. That was all that had been explicitly in her
17262: mind; but she had been urged also by a vague discomfort. Now that she
17263: was alone in her drive, she heard the notes of the man’s voice and the
17264: accompanying piano, which she had not noted much at the time, returning
17265: on her inward sense; and she found herself thinking with some wonder
17266: that Will Ladislaw was passing his time with Mrs. Lydgate in her
17267: husband’s absence. And then she could not help remembering that he had
17268: passed some time with her under like circumstances, so why should there
17269: be any unfitness in the fact? But Will was Mr. Casaubon’s relative, and
17270: one towards whom she was bound to show kindness. Still there had been
17271: signs which perhaps she ought to have understood as implying that Mr.
17272: Casaubon did not like his cousin’s visits during his own absence.
17273: “Perhaps I have been mistaken in many things,” said poor Dorothea to
17274: herself, while the tears came rolling and she had to dry them quickly.
17275: She felt confusedly unhappy, and the image of Will which had been so
17276: clear to her before was mysteriously spoiled. But the carriage stopped
17277: at the gate of the Hospital. She was soon walking round the grass plots
17278: with Lydgate, and her feelings recovered the strong bent which had made
17279: her seek for this interview.
17280: 
17281: Will Ladislaw, meanwhile, was mortified, and knew the reason of it
17282: clearly enough. His chances of meeting Dorothea were rare; and here for
17283: the first time there had come a chance which had set him at a
17284: disadvantage. It was not only, as it had been hitherto, that she was
17285: not supremely occupied with him, but that she had seen him under
17286: circumstances in which he might appear not to be supremely occupied
17287: with her. He felt thrust to a new distance from her, amongst the
17288: circles of Middlemarchers who made no part of her life. But that was
17289: not his fault: of course, since he had taken his lodgings in the town,
17290: he had been making as many acquaintances as he could, his position
17291: requiring that he should know everybody and everything. Lydgate was
17292: really better worth knowing than any one else in the neighborhood, and
17293: he happened to have a wife who was musical and altogether worth calling
17294: upon. Here was the whole history of the situation in which Diana had
17295: descended too unexpectedly on her worshipper. It was mortifying. Will
17296: was conscious that he should not have been at Middlemarch but for
17297: Dorothea; and yet his position there was threatening to divide him from
17298: her with those barriers of habitual sentiment which are more fatal to
17299: the persistence of mutual interest than all the distance between Rome
17300: and Britain. Prejudices about rank and status were easy enough to defy
17301: in the form of a tyrannical letter from Mr. Casaubon; but prejudices,
17302: like odorous bodies, have a double existence both solid and
17303: subtle—solid as the pyramids, subtle as the twentieth echo of an echo,
17304: or as the memory of hyacinths which once scented the darkness. And Will
17305: was of a temperament to feel keenly the presence of subtleties: a man
17306: of clumsier perceptions would not have felt, as he did, that for the
17307: first time some sense of unfitness in perfect freedom with him had
17308: sprung up in Dorothea’s mind, and that their silence, as he conducted
17309: her to the carriage, had had a chill in it. Perhaps Casaubon, in his
17310: hatred and jealousy, had been insisting to Dorothea that Will had slid
17311: below her socially. Confound Casaubon!
17312: 
17313: Will re-entered the drawing-room, took up his hat, and looking
17314: irritated as he advanced towards Mrs. Lydgate, who had seated herself
17315: at her work-table, said—
17316: 
17317: “It is always fatal to have music or poetry interrupted. May I come
17318: another day and just finish about the rendering of ‘Lungi dal caro
17319: bene’?”
17320: 
17321: “I shall be happy to be taught,” said Rosamond. “But I am sure you
17322: admit that the interruption was a very beautiful one. I quite envy your
17323: acquaintance with Mrs. Casaubon. Is she very clever? She looks as if
17324: she were.”
17325: 
17326: “Really, I never thought about it,” said Will, sulkily.
17327: 
17328: “That is just the answer Tertius gave me, when I first asked him if she
17329: were handsome. What is it that you gentlemen are thinking of when you
17330: are with Mrs. Casaubon?”
17331: 
17332: “Herself,” said Will, not indisposed to provoke the charming Mrs.
17333: Lydgate. “When one sees a perfect woman, one never thinks of her
17334: attributes—one is conscious of her presence.”
17335: 
17336: “I shall be jealous when Tertius goes to Lowick,” said Rosamond,
17337: dimpling, and speaking with aery lightness. “He will come back and
17338: think nothing of me.”
17339: 
17340: “That does not seem to have been the effect on Lydgate hitherto. Mrs.
17341: Casaubon is too unlike other women for them to be compared with her.”
17342: 
17343: “You are a devout worshipper, I perceive. You often see her, I
17344: suppose.”
17345: 
17346: “No,” said Will, almost pettishly. “Worship is usually a matter of
17347: theory rather than of practice. But I am practising it to excess just
17348: at this moment—I must really tear myself away.”
17349: 
17350: “Pray come again some evening: Mr. Lydgate will like to hear the music,
17351: and I cannot enjoy it so well without him.”
17352: 
17353: When her husband was at home again, Rosamond said, standing in front of
17354: him and holding his coat-collar with both her hands, “Mr. Ladislaw was
17355: here singing with me when Mrs. Casaubon came in. He seemed vexed. Do
17356: you think he disliked her seeing him at our house? Surely your position
17357: is more than equal to his—whatever may be his relation to the
17358: Casaubons.”
17359: 
17360: “No, no; it must be something else if he were really vexed. Ladislaw is
17361: a sort of gypsy; he thinks nothing of leather and prunella.”
17362: 
17363: “Music apart, he is not always very agreeable. Do you like him?”
17364: 
17365: “Yes: I think he is a good fellow: rather miscellaneous and
17366: bric-a-brac, but likable.”
17367: 
17368: “Do you know, I think he adores Mrs. Casaubon.”
17369: 
17370: “Poor devil!” said Lydgate, smiling and pinching his wife’s ears.
17371: 
17372: Rosamond felt herself beginning to know a great deal of the world,
17373: especially in discovering what when she was in her unmarried girlhood
17374: had been inconceivable to her except as a dim tragedy in by-gone
17375: costumes—that women, even after marriage, might make conquests and
17376: enslave men. At that time young ladies in the country, even when
17377: educated at Mrs. Lemon’s, read little French literature later than
17378: Racine, and public prints had not cast their present magnificent
17379: illumination over the scandals of life. Still, vanity, with a woman’s
17380: whole mind and day to work in, can construct abundantly on slight
17381: hints, especially on such a hint as the possibility of indefinite
17382: conquests. How delightful to make captives from the throne of marriage
17383: with a husband as crown-prince by your side—himself in fact a
17384: subject—while the captives look up forever hopeless, losing their rest
17385: probably, and if their appetite too, so much the better! But Rosamond’s
17386: romance turned at present chiefly on her crown-prince, and it was
17387: enough to enjoy his assured subjection. When he said, “Poor devil!” she
17388: asked, with playful curiosity—
17389: 
17390: “Why so?”
17391: 
17392: “Why, what can a man do when he takes to adoring one of you mermaids?
17393: He only neglects his work and runs up bills.”
17394: 
17395: “I am sure you do not neglect your work. You are always at the
17396: Hospital, or seeing poor patients, or thinking about some doctor’s
17397: quarrel; and then at home you always want to pore over your microscope
17398: and phials. Confess you like those things better than me.”
17399: 
17400: “Haven’t you ambition enough to wish that your husband should be
17401: something better than a Middlemarch doctor?” said Lydgate, letting his
17402: hands fall on to his wife’s shoulders, and looking at her with
17403: affectionate gravity. “I shall make you learn my favorite bit from an
17404: old poet—
17405: 
17406: ‘Why should our pride make such a stir to be
17407: And be forgot? What good is like to this,
17408: To do worthy the writing, and to write
17409: Worthy the reading and the worlds delight?’
17410: 
17411: 
17412: What I want, Rosy, is to do worthy the writing,—and to write out myself
17413: what I have done. A man must work, to do that, my pet.”
17414: 
17415: “Of course, I wish you to make discoveries: no one could more wish you
17416: to attain a high position in some better place than Middlemarch. You
17417: cannot say that I have ever tried to hinder you from working. But we
17418: cannot live like hermits. You are not discontented with me, Tertius?”
17419: 
17420: “No, dear, no. I am too entirely contented.”
17421: 
17422: “But what did Mrs. Casaubon want to say to you?”
17423: 
17424: “Merely to ask about her husband’s health. But I think she is going to
17425: be splendid to our New Hospital: I think she will give us two hundred
17426: a-year.”
17427: 
17428: 
17429: 
17430: 
17431: CHAPTER XLIV.
17432: 
17433: I would not creep along the coast but steer
17434: Out in mid-sea, by guidance of the stars.
17435: 
17436: 
17437: When Dorothea, walking round the laurel-planted plots of the New
17438: Hospital with Lydgate, had learned from him that there were no signs of
17439: change in Mr. Casaubon’s bodily condition beyond the mental sign of
17440: anxiety to know the truth about his illness, she was silent for a few
17441: moments, wondering whether she had said or done anything to rouse this
17442: new anxiety. Lydgate, not willing to let slip an opportunity of
17443: furthering a favorite purpose, ventured to say—
17444: 
17445: “I don’t know whether your or Mr. Casaubon’s attention has been drawn
17446: to the needs of our New Hospital. Circumstances have made it seem
17447: rather egotistic in me to urge the subject; but that is not my fault:
17448: it is because there is a fight being made against it by the other
17449: medical men. I think you are generally interested in such things, for I
17450: remember that when I first had the pleasure of seeing you at Tipton
17451: Grange before your marriage, you were asking me some questions about
17452: the way in which the health of the poor was affected by their miserable
17453: housing.”
17454: 
17455: “Yes, indeed,” said Dorothea, brightening. “I shall be quite grateful
17456: to you if you will tell me how I can help to make things a little
17457: better. Everything of that sort has slipped away from me since I have
17458: been married. I mean,” she said, after a moment’s hesitation, “that the
17459: people in our village are tolerably comfortable, and my mind has been
17460: too much taken up for me to inquire further. But here—in such a place
17461: as Middlemarch—there must be a great deal to be done.”
17462: 
17463: “There is everything to be done,” said Lydgate, with abrupt energy.
17464: “And this Hospital is a capital piece of work, due entirely to Mr.
17465: Bulstrode’s exertions, and in a great degree to his money. But one man
17466: can’t do everything in a scheme of this sort. Of course he looked
17467: forward to help. And now there’s a mean, petty feud set up against the
17468: thing in the town, by certain persons who want to make it a failure.”
17469: 
17470: “What can be their reasons?” said Dorothea, with naive surprise.
17471: 
17472: “Chiefly Mr. Bulstrode’s unpopularity, to begin with. Half the town
17473: would almost take trouble for the sake of thwarting him. In this stupid
17474: world most people never consider that a thing is good to be done unless
17475: it is done by their own set. I had no connection with Bulstrode before
17476: I came here. I look at him quite impartially, and I see that he has
17477: some notions—that he has set things on foot—which I can turn to good
17478: public purpose. If a fair number of the better educated men went to
17479: work with the belief that their observations might contribute to the
17480: reform of medical doctrine and practice, we should soon see a change
17481: for the better. That’s my point of view. I hold that by refusing to
17482: work with Mr. Bulstrode I should be turning my back on an opportunity
17483: of making my profession more generally serviceable.”
17484: 
17485: “I quite agree with you,” said Dorothea, at once fascinated by the
17486: situation sketched in Lydgate’s words. “But what is there against Mr.
17487: Bulstrode? I know that my uncle is friendly with him.”
17488: 
17489: “People don’t like his religious tone,” said Lydgate, breaking off
17490: there.
17491: 
17492: “That is all the stronger reason for despising such an opposition,”
17493: said Dorothea, looking at the affairs of Middlemarch by the light of
17494: the great persecutions.
17495: 
17496: “To put the matter quite fairly, they have other objections to him:—he
17497: is masterful and rather unsociable, and he is concerned with trade,
17498: which has complaints of its own that I know nothing about. But what has
17499: that to do with the question whether it would not be a fine thing to
17500: establish here a more valuable hospital than any they have in the
17501: county? The immediate motive to the opposition, however, is the fact
17502: that Bulstrode has put the medical direction into my hands. Of course I
17503: am glad of that. It gives me an opportunity of doing some good
17504: work,—and I am aware that I have to justify his choice of me. But the
17505: consequence is, that the whole profession in Middlemarch have set
17506: themselves tooth and nail against the Hospital, and not only refuse to
17507: cooperate themselves, but try to blacken the whole affair and hinder
17508: subscriptions.”
17509: 
17510: “How very petty!” exclaimed Dorothea, indignantly.
17511: 
17512: “I suppose one must expect to fight one’s way: there is hardly anything
17513: to be done without it. And the ignorance of people about here is
17514: stupendous. I don’t lay claim to anything else than having used some
17515: opportunities which have not come within everybody’s reach; but there
17516: is no stifling the offence of being young, and a new-comer, and
17517: happening to know something more than the old inhabitants. Still, if I
17518: believe that I can set going a better method of treatment—if I believe
17519: that I can pursue certain observations and inquiries which may be a
17520: lasting benefit to medical practice, I should be a base truckler if I
17521: allowed any consideration of personal comfort to hinder me. And the
17522: course is all the clearer from there being no salary in question to put
17523: my persistence in an equivocal light.”
17524: 
17525: “I am glad you have told me this, Mr. Lydgate,” said Dorothea,
17526: cordially. “I feel sure I can help a little. I have some money, and
17527: don’t know what to do with it—that is often an uncomfortable thought to
17528: me. I am sure I can spare two hundred a-year for a grand purpose like
17529: this. How happy you must be, to know things that you feel sure will do
17530: great good! I wish I could awake with that knowledge every morning.
17531: There seems to be so much trouble taken that one can hardly see the
17532: good of!”
17533: 
17534: There was a melancholy cadence in Dorothea’s voice as she spoke these
17535: last words. But she presently added, more cheerfully, “Pray come to
17536: Lowick and tell us more of this. I will mention the subject to Mr.
17537: Casaubon. I must hasten home now.”
17538: 
17539: She did mention it that evening, and said that she should like to
17540: subscribe two hundred a-year—she had seven hundred a-year as the
17541: equivalent of her own fortune, settled on her at her marriage. Mr.
17542: Casaubon made no objection beyond a passing remark that the sum might
17543: be disproportionate in relation to other good objects, but when
17544: Dorothea in her ignorance resisted that suggestion, he acquiesced. He
17545: did not care himself about spending money, and was not reluctant to
17546: give it. If he ever felt keenly any question of money it was through
17547: the medium of another passion than the love of material property.
17548: 
17549: Dorothea told him that she had seen Lydgate, and recited the gist of
17550: her conversation with him about the Hospital. Mr. Casaubon did not
17551: question her further, but he felt sure that she had wished to know what
17552: had passed between Lydgate and himself. “She knows that I know,” said
17553: the ever-restless voice within; but that increase of tacit knowledge
17554: only thrust further off any confidence between them. He distrusted her
17555: affection; and what loneliness is more lonely than distrust?
17556: 
17557: 
17558: 
17559: 
17560: CHAPTER XLV.
17561: 
17562: It is the humor of many heads to extol the days of their forefathers,
17563: and declaim against the wickedness of times present. Which
17564: notwithstanding they cannot handsomely do, without the borrowed help
17565: and satire of times past; condemning the vices of their own times, by
17566: the expressions of vices in times which they commend, which cannot but
17567: argue the community of vice in both. Horace, therefore, Juvenal, and
17568: Persius, were no prophets, although their lines did seem to indigitate
17569: and point at our times.—SIR THOMAS BROWNE: _Pseudodoxia Epidemica_.
17570: 
17571: 
17572: That opposition to the New Fever Hospital which Lydgate had sketched to
17573: Dorothea was, like other oppositions, to be viewed in many different
17574: lights. He regarded it as a mixture of jealousy and dunderheaded
17575: prejudice. Mr. Bulstrode saw in it not only medical jealousy but a
17576: determination to thwart himself, prompted mainly by a hatred of that
17577: vital religion of which he had striven to be an effectual lay
17578: representative—a hatred which certainly found pretexts apart from
17579: religion such as were only too easy to find in the entanglements of
17580: human action. These might be called the ministerial views. But
17581: oppositions have the illimitable range of objections at command, which
17582: need never stop short at the boundary of knowledge, but can draw
17583: forever on the vasts of ignorance. What the opposition in Middlemarch
17584: said about the New Hospital and its administration had certainly a
17585: great deal of echo in it, for heaven has taken care that everybody
17586: shall not be an originator; but there were differences which
17587: represented every social shade between the polished moderation of Dr.
17588: Minchin and the trenchant assertion of Mrs. Dollop, the landlady of the
17589: Tankard in Slaughter Lane.
17590: 
17591: Mrs. Dollop became more and more convinced by her own asseveration,
17592: that Dr. Lydgate meant to let the people die in the Hospital, if not to
17593: poison them, for the sake of cutting them up without saying by your
17594: leave or with your leave; for it was a known “fac” that he had wanted
17595: to cut up Mrs. Goby, as respectable a woman as any in Parley Street,
17596: who had money in trust before her marriage—a poor tale for a doctor,
17597: who if he was good for anything should know what was the matter with
17598: you before you died, and not want to pry into your inside after you
17599: were gone. If that was not reason, Mrs. Dollop wished to know what was;
17600: but there was a prevalent feeling in her audience that her opinion was
17601: a bulwark, and that if it were overthrown there would be no limits to
17602: the cutting-up of bodies, as had been well seen in Burke and Hare with
17603: their pitch-plaisters—such a hanging business as that was not wanted in
17604: Middlemarch!
17605: 
17606: And let it not be supposed that opinion at the Tankard in Slaughter
17607: Lane was unimportant to the medical profession: that old authentic
17608: public-house—the original Tankard, known by the name of Dollop’s—was
17609: the resort of a great Benefit Club, which had some months before put to
17610: the vote whether its long-standing medical man, “Doctor Gambit,” should
17611: not be cashiered in favor of “this Doctor Lydgate,” who was capable of
17612: performing the most astonishing cures, and rescuing people altogether
17613: given up by other practitioners. But the balance had been turned
17614: against Lydgate by two members, who for some private reasons held that
17615: this power of resuscitating persons as good as dead was an equivocal
17616: recommendation, and might interfere with providential favors. In the
17617: course of the year, however, there had been a change in the public
17618: sentiment, of which the unanimity at Dollop’s was an index.
17619: 
17620: A good deal more than a year ago, before anything was known of
17621: Lydgate’s skill, the judgments on it had naturally been divided,
17622: depending on a sense of likelihood, situated perhaps in the pit of the
17623: stomach or in the pineal gland, and differing in its verdicts, but not
17624: the less valuable as a guide in the total deficit of evidence. Patients
17625: who had chronic diseases or whose lives had long been worn threadbare,
17626: like old Featherstone’s, had been at once inclined to try him; also,
17627: many who did not like paying their doctor’s bills, thought agreeably of
17628: opening an account with a new doctor and sending for him without stint
17629: if the children’s temper wanted a dose, occasions when the old
17630: practitioners were often crusty; and all persons thus inclined to
17631: employ Lydgate held it likely that he was clever. Some considered that
17632: he might do more than others “where there was liver;”—at least there
17633: would be no harm in getting a few bottles of “stuff” from him, since if
17634: these proved useless it would still be possible to return to the
17635: Purifying Pills, which kept you alive if they did not remove the
17636: yellowness. But these were people of minor importance. Good Middlemarch
17637: families were of course not going to change their doctor without reason
17638: shown; and everybody who had employed Mr. Peacock did not feel obliged
17639: to accept a new man merely in the character of his successor, objecting
17640: that he was “not likely to be equal to Peacock.”
17641: 
17642: But Lydgate had not been long in the town before there were particulars
17643: enough reported of him to breed much more specific expectations and to
17644: intensify differences into partisanship; some of the particulars being
17645: of that impressive order of which the significance is entirely hidden,
17646: like a statistical amount without a standard of comparison, but with a
17647: note of exclamation at the end. The cubic feet of oxygen yearly
17648: swallowed by a full-grown man—what a shudder they might have created in
17649: some Middlemarch circles! “Oxygen! nobody knows what that may be—is it
17650: any wonder the cholera has got to Dantzic? And yet there are people who
17651: say quarantine is no good!”
17652: 
17653: One of the facts quickly rumored was that Lydgate did not dispense
17654: drugs. This was offensive both to the physicians whose exclusive
17655: distinction seemed infringed on, and to the surgeon-apothecaries with
17656: whom he ranged himself; and only a little while before, they might have
17657: counted on having the law on their side against a man who without
17658: calling himself a London-made M.D. dared to ask for pay except as a
17659: charge on drugs. But Lydgate had not been experienced enough to foresee
17660: that his new course would be even more offensive to the laity; and to
17661: Mr. Mawmsey, an important grocer in the Top Market, who, though not one
17662: of his patients, questioned him in an affable manner on the subject, he
17663: was injudicious enough to give a hasty popular explanation of his
17664: reasons, pointing out to Mr. Mawmsey that it must lower the character
17665: of practitioners, and be a constant injury to the public, if their only
17666: mode of getting paid for their work was by their making out long bills
17667: for draughts, boluses, and mixtures.
17668: 
17669: “It is in that way that hard-working medical men may come to be almost
17670: as mischievous as quacks,” said Lydgate, rather thoughtlessly. “To get
17671: their own bread they must overdose the king’s lieges; and that’s a bad
17672: sort of treason, Mr. Mawmsey—undermines the constitution in a fatal
17673: way.”
17674: 
17675: Mr. Mawmsey was not only an overseer (it was about a question of
17676: outdoor pay that he was having an interview with Lydgate), he was also
17677: asthmatic and had an increasing family: thus, from a medical point of
17678: view, as well as from his own, he was an important man; indeed, an
17679: exceptional grocer, whose hair was arranged in a flame-like pyramid,
17680: and whose retail deference was of the cordial, encouraging
17681: kind—jocosely complimentary, and with a certain considerate abstinence
17682: from letting out the full force of his mind. It was Mr. Mawmsey’s
17683: friendly jocoseness in questioning him which had set the tone of
17684: Lydgate’s reply. But let the wise be warned against too great readiness
17685: at explanation: it multiplies the sources of mistake, lengthening the
17686: sum for reckoners sure to go wrong.
17687: 
17688: Lydgate smiled as he ended his speech, putting his foot into the
17689: stirrup, and Mr. Mawmsey laughed more than he would have done if he had
17690: known who the king’s lieges were, giving his “Good morning, sir,
17691: good-morning, sir,” with the air of one who saw everything clearly
17692: enough. But in truth his views were perturbed. For years he had been
17693: paying bills with strictly made items, so that for every half-crown and
17694: eighteen-pence he was certain something measurable had been delivered.
17695: He had done this with satisfaction, including it among his
17696: responsibilities as a husband and father, and regarding a longer bill
17697: than usual as a dignity worth mentioning. Moreover, in addition to the
17698: massive benefit of the drugs to “self and family,” he had enjoyed the
17699: pleasure of forming an acute judgment as to their immediate effects, so
17700: as to give an intelligent statement for the guidance of Mr. Gambit—a
17701: practitioner just a little lower in status than Wrench or Toller, and
17702: especially esteemed as an accoucheur, of whose ability Mr. Mawmsey had
17703: the poorest opinion on all other points, but in doctoring, he was wont
17704: to say in an undertone, he placed Gambit above any of them.
17705: 
17706: Here were deeper reasons than the superficial talk of a new man, which
17707: appeared still flimsier in the drawing-room over the shop, when they
17708: were recited to Mrs. Mawmsey, a woman accustomed to be made much of as
17709: a fertile mother,—generally under attendance more or less frequent from
17710: Mr. Gambit, and occasionally having attacks which required Dr. Minchin.
17711: 
17712: “Does this Mr. Lydgate mean to say there is no use in taking medicine?”
17713: said Mrs. Mawmsey, who was slightly given to drawling. “I should like
17714: him to tell me how I could bear up at Fair time, if I didn’t take
17715: strengthening medicine for a month beforehand. Think of what I have to
17716: provide for calling customers, my dear!”—here Mrs. Mawmsey turned to an
17717: intimate female friend who sat by—“a large veal pie—a stuffed fillet—a
17718: round of beef—ham, tongue, et cetera, et cetera! But what keeps me up
17719: best is the pink mixture, not the brown. I wonder, Mr. Mawmsey, with
17720: _your_ experience, you could have patience to listen. I should have
17721: told him at once that I knew a little better than that.”
17722: 
17723: “No, no, no,” said Mr. Mawmsey; “I was not going to tell him my
17724: opinion. Hear everything and judge for yourself is my motto. But he
17725: didn’t know who he was talking to. I was not to be turned on _his_
17726: finger. People often pretend to tell me things, when they might as well
17727: say, ‘Mawmsey, you’re a fool.’ But I smile at it: I humor everybody’s
17728: weak place. If physic had done harm to self and family, I should have
17729: found it out by this time.”
17730: 
17731: The next day Mr. Gambit was told that Lydgate went about saying physic
17732: was of no use.
17733: 
17734: “Indeed!” said he, lifting his eyebrows with cautious surprise. (He was
17735: a stout husky man with a large ring on his fourth finger.) “How will he
17736: cure his patients, then?”
17737: 
17738: “That is what I say,” returned Mrs. Mawmsey, who habitually gave weight
17739: to her speech by loading her pronouns. “Does _he_ suppose that people
17740: will pay him only to come and sit with them and go away again?”
17741: 
17742: Mrs. Mawmsey had had a great deal of sitting from Mr. Gambit, including
17743: very full accounts of his own habits of body and other affairs; but of
17744: course he knew there was no innuendo in her remark, since his spare
17745: time and personal narrative had never been charged for. So he replied,
17746: humorously—
17747: 
17748: “Well, Lydgate is a good-looking young fellow, you know.”
17749: 
17750: “Not one that _I_ would employ,” said Mrs. Mawmsey. “_Others_ may do as
17751: they please.”
17752: 
17753: Hence Mr. Gambit could go away from the chief grocer’s without fear of
17754: rivalry, but not without a sense that Lydgate was one of those
17755: hypocrites who try to discredit others by advertising their own
17756: honesty, and that it might be worth some people’s while to show him up.
17757: Mr. Gambit, however, had a satisfactory practice, much pervaded by the
17758: smells of retail trading which suggested the reduction of cash payments
17759: to a balance. And he did not think it worth his while to show Lydgate
17760: up until he knew how. He had not indeed great resources of education,
17761: and had had to work his own way against a good deal of professional
17762: contempt; but he made none the worse accoucheur for calling the
17763: breathing apparatus “longs.”
17764: 
17765: Other medical men felt themselves more capable. Mr. Toller shared the
17766: highest practice in the town and belonged to an old Middlemarch family:
17767: there were Tollers in the law and everything else above the line of
17768: retail trade. Unlike our irascible friend Wrench, he had the easiest
17769: way in the world of taking things which might be supposed to annoy him,
17770: being a well-bred, quietly facetious man, who kept a good house, was
17771: very fond of a little sporting when he could get it, very friendly with
17772: Mr. Hawley, and hostile to Mr. Bulstrode. It may seem odd that with
17773: such pleasant habits he should have been given to the heroic treatment,
17774: bleeding and blistering and starving his patients, with a dispassionate
17775: disregard to his personal example; but the incongruity favored the
17776: opinion of his ability among his patients, who commonly observed that
17777: Mr. Toller had lazy manners, but his treatment was as active as you
17778: could desire: no man, said they, carried more seriousness into his
17779: profession: he was a little slow in coming, but when he came, he _did_
17780: something. He was a great favorite in his own circle, and whatever he
17781: implied to any one’s disadvantage told doubly from his careless
17782: ironical tone.
17783: 
17784: He naturally got tired of smiling and saying, “Ah!” when he was told
17785: that Mr. Peacock’s successor did not mean to dispense medicines; and
17786: Mr. Hackbutt one day mentioning it over the wine at a dinner-party, Mr.
17787: Toller said, laughingly, “Dibbitts will get rid of his stale drugs,
17788: then. I’m fond of little Dibbitts—I’m glad he’s in luck.”
17789: 
17790: “I see your meaning, Toller,” said Mr. Hackbutt, “and I am entirely of
17791: your opinion. I shall take an opportunity of expressing myself to that
17792: effect. A medical man should be responsible for the quality of the
17793: drugs consumed by his patients. That is the rationale of the system of
17794: charging which has hitherto obtained; and nothing is more offensive
17795: than this ostentation of reform, where there is no real amelioration.”
17796: 
17797: “Ostentation, Hackbutt?” said Mr. Toller, ironically. “I don’t see
17798: that. A man can’t very well be ostentatious of what nobody believes in.
17799: There’s no reform in the matter: the question is, whether the profit on
17800: the drugs is paid to the medical man by the druggist or by the patient,
17801: and whether there shall be extra pay under the name of attendance.”
17802: 
17803: “Ah, to be sure; one of your damned new versions of old humbug,” said
17804: Mr. Hawley, passing the decanter to Mr. Wrench.
17805: 
17806: Mr. Wrench, generally abstemious, often drank wine rather freely at a
17807: party, getting the more irritable in consequence.
17808: 
17809: “As to humbug, Hawley,” he said, “that’s a word easy to fling about.
17810: But what I contend against is the way medical men are fouling their own
17811: nest, and setting up a cry about the country as if a general
17812: practitioner who dispenses drugs couldn’t be a gentleman. I throw back
17813: the imputation with scorn. I say, the most ungentlemanly trick a man
17814: can be guilty of is to come among the members of his profession with
17815: innovations which are a libel on their time-honored procedure. That is
17816: my opinion, and I am ready to maintain it against any one who
17817: contradicts me.” Mr. Wrench’s voice had become exceedingly sharp.
17818: 
17819: “I can’t oblige you there, Wrench,” said Mr. Hawley, thrusting his
17820: hands into his trouser-pockets.
17821: 
17822: “My dear fellow,” said Mr. Toller, striking in pacifically, and looking
17823: at Mr. Wrench, “the physicians have their toes trodden on more than we
17824: have. If you come to dignity it is a question for Minchin and Sprague.”
17825: 
17826: “Does medical jurisprudence provide nothing against these
17827: infringements?” said Mr. Hackbutt, with a disinterested desire to offer
17828: his lights. “How does the law stand, eh, Hawley?”
17829: 
17830: “Nothing to be done there,” said Mr. Hawley. “I looked into it for
17831: Sprague. You’d only break your nose against a damned judge’s decision.”
17832: 
17833: “Pooh! no need of law,” said Mr. Toller. “So far as practice is
17834: concerned the attempt is an absurdity. No patient will like
17835: it—certainly not Peacock’s, who have been used to depletion. Pass the
17836: wine.”
17837: 
17838: Mr. Toller’s prediction was partly verified. If Mr. and Mrs. Mawmsey,
17839: who had no idea of employing Lydgate, were made uneasy by his supposed
17840: declaration against drugs, it was inevitable that those who called him
17841: in should watch a little anxiously to see whether he did “use all the
17842: means he might use” in the case. Even good Mr. Powderell, who in his
17843: constant charity of interpretation was inclined to esteem Lydgate the
17844: more for what seemed a conscientious pursuit of a better plan, had his
17845: mind disturbed with doubts during his wife’s attack of erysipelas, and
17846: could not abstain from mentioning to Lydgate that Mr. Peacock on a
17847: similar occasion had administered a series of boluses which were not
17848: otherwise definable than by their remarkable effect in bringing Mrs.
17849: Powderell round before Michaelmas from an illness which had begun in a
17850: remarkably hot August. At last, indeed, in the conflict between his
17851: desire not to hurt Lydgate and his anxiety that no “means” should be
17852: lacking, he induced his wife privately to take Widgeon’s Purifying
17853: Pills, an esteemed Middlemarch medicine, which arrested every disease
17854: at the fountain by setting to work at once upon the blood. This
17855: co-operative measure was not to be mentioned to Lydgate, and Mr.
17856: Powderell himself had no certain reliance on it, only hoping that it
17857: might be attended with a blessing.
17858: 
17859: But in this doubtful stage of Lydgate’s introduction he was helped by
17860: what we mortals rashly call good fortune. I suppose no doctor ever came
17861: newly to a place without making cures that surprised somebody—cures
17862: which may be called fortune’s testimonials, and deserve as much credit
17863: as the written or printed kind. Various patients got well while Lydgate
17864: was attending them, some even of dangerous illnesses; and it was
17865: remarked that the new doctor with his new ways had at least the merit
17866: of bringing people back from the brink of death. The trash talked on
17867: such occasions was the more vexatious to Lydgate, because it gave
17868: precisely the sort of prestige which an incompetent and unscrupulous
17869: man would desire, and was sure to be imputed to him by the simmering
17870: dislike of the other medical men as an encouragement on his own part of
17871: ignorant puffing. But even his proud outspokenness was checked by the
17872: discernment that it was as useless to fight against the interpretations
17873: of ignorance as to whip the fog; and “good fortune” insisted on using
17874: those interpretations.
17875: 
17876: Mrs. Larcher having just become charitably concerned about alarming
17877: symptoms in her charwoman, when Dr. Minchin called, asked him to see
17878: her then and there, and to give her a certificate for the Infirmary;
17879: whereupon after examination he wrote a statement of the case as one of
17880: tumor, and recommended the bearer Nancy Nash as an out-patient. Nancy,
17881: calling at home on her way to the Infirmary, allowed the stay maker and
17882: his wife, in whose attic she lodged, to read Dr. Minchin’s paper, and
17883: by this means became a subject of compassionate conversation in the
17884: neighboring shops of Churchyard Lane as being afflicted with a tumor at
17885: first declared to be as large and hard as a duck’s egg, but later in
17886: the day to be about the size of “your fist.” Most hearers agreed that
17887: it would have to be cut out, but one had known of oil and another of
17888: “squitchineal” as adequate to soften and reduce any lump in the body
17889: when taken enough of into the inside—the oil by gradually “soopling,”
17890: the squitchineal by eating away.
17891: 
17892: Meanwhile when Nancy presented herself at the Infirmary, it happened to
17893: be one of Lydgate’s days there. After questioning and examining her,
17894: Lydgate said to the house-surgeon in an undertone, “It’s not tumor:
17895: it’s cramp.” He ordered her a blister and some steel mixture, and told
17896: her to go home and rest, giving her at the same time a note to Mrs.
17897: Larcher, who, she said, was her best employer, to testify that she was
17898: in need of good food.
17899: 
17900: But by-and-by Nancy, in her attic, became portentously worse, the
17901: supposed tumor having indeed given way to the blister, but only
17902: wandered to another region with angrier pain. The staymaker’s wife went
17903: to fetch Lydgate, and he continued for a fortnight to attend Nancy in
17904: her own home, until under his treatment she got quite well and went to
17905: work again. But the case continued to be described as one of tumor in
17906: Churchyard Lane and other streets—nay, by Mrs. Larcher also; for when
17907: Lydgate’s remarkable cure was mentioned to Dr. Minchin, he naturally
17908: did not like to say, “The case was not one of tumor, and I was mistaken
17909: in describing it as such,” but answered, “Indeed! ah! I saw it was a
17910: surgical case, not of a fatal kind.” He had been inwardly annoyed,
17911: however, when he had asked at the Infirmary about the woman he had
17912: recommended two days before, to hear from the house-surgeon, a
17913: youngster who was not sorry to vex Minchin with impunity, exactly what
17914: had occurred: he privately pronounced that it was indecent in a general
17915: practitioner to contradict a physician’s diagnosis in that open manner,
17916: and afterwards agreed with Wrench that Lydgate was disagreeably
17917: inattentive to etiquette. Lydgate did not make the affair a ground for
17918: valuing himself or (very particularly) despising Minchin, such
17919: rectification of misjudgments often happening among men of equal
17920: qualifications. But report took up this amazing case of tumor, not
17921: clearly distinguished from cancer, and considered the more awful for
17922: being of the wandering sort; till much prejudice against Lydgate’s
17923: method as to drugs was overcome by the proof of his marvellous skill in
17924: the speedy restoration of Nancy Nash after she had been rolling and
17925: rolling in agonies from the presence of a tumor both hard and
17926: obstinate, but nevertheless compelled to yield.
17927: 
17928: How could Lydgate help himself? It is offensive to tell a lady when she
17929: is expressing her amazement at your skill, that she is altogether
17930: mistaken and rather foolish in her amazement. And to have entered into
17931: the nature of diseases would only have added to his breaches of medical
17932: propriety. Thus he had to wince under a promise of success given by
17933: that ignorant praise which misses every valid quality.
17934: 
17935: In the case of a more conspicuous patient, Mr. Borthrop Trumbull,
17936: Lydgate was conscious of having shown himself something better than an
17937: every-day doctor, though here too it was an equivocal advantage that he
17938: won. The eloquent auctioneer was seized with pneumonia, and having been
17939: a patient of Mr. Peacock’s, sent for Lydgate, whom he had expressed his
17940: intention to patronize. Mr Trumbull was a robust man, a good subject
17941: for trying the expectant theory upon—watching the course of an
17942: interesting disease when left as much as possible to itself, so that
17943: the stages might be noted for future guidance; and from the air with
17944: which he described his sensations Lydgate surmised that he would like
17945: to be taken into his medical man’s confidence, and be represented as a
17946: partner in his own cure. The auctioneer heard, without much surprise,
17947: that his was a constitution which (always with due watching) might be
17948: left to itself, so as to offer a beautiful example of a disease with
17949: all its phases seen in clear delineation, and that he probably had the
17950: rare strength of mind voluntarily to become the test of a rational
17951: procedure, and thus make the disorder of his pulmonary functions a
17952: general benefit to society.
17953: 
17954: Mr. Trumbull acquiesced at once, and entered strongly into the view
17955: that an illness of his was no ordinary occasion for medical science.
17956: 
17957: “Never fear, sir; you are not speaking to one who is altogether
17958: ignorant of the _vis medicatrix_,” said he, with his usual superiority
17959: of expression, made rather pathetic by difficulty of breathing. And he
17960: went without shrinking through his abstinence from drugs, much
17961: sustained by application of the thermometer which implied the
17962: importance of his temperature, by the sense that he furnished objects
17963: for the microscope, and by learning many new words which seemed suited
17964: to the dignity of his secretions. For Lydgate was acute enough to
17965: indulge him with a little technical talk.
17966: 
17967: It may be imagined that Mr. Trumbull rose from his couch with a
17968: disposition to speak of an illness in which he had manifested the
17969: strength of his mind as well as constitution; and he was not backward
17970: in awarding credit to the medical man who had discerned the quality of
17971: patient he had to deal with. The auctioneer was not an ungenerous man,
17972: and liked to give others their due, feeling that he could afford it. He
17973: had caught the words “expectant method,” and rang chimes on this and
17974: other learned phrases to accompany the assurance that Lydgate “knew a
17975: thing or two more than the rest of the doctors—was far better versed in
17976: the secrets of his profession than the majority of his compeers.”
17977: 
17978: This had happened before the affair of Fred Vincy’s illness had given
17979: to Mr. Wrench’s enmity towards Lydgate more definite personal ground.
17980: The new-comer already threatened to be a nuisance in the shape of
17981: rivalry, and was certainly a nuisance in the shape of practical
17982: criticism or reflections on his hard-driven elders, who had had
17983: something else to do than to busy themselves with untried notions. His
17984: practice had spread in one or two quarters, and from the first the
17985: report of his high family had led to his being pretty generally
17986: invited, so that the other medical men had to meet him at dinner in the
17987: best houses; and having to meet a man whom you dislike is not observed
17988: always to end in a mutual attachment. There was hardly ever so much
17989: unanimity among them as in the opinion that Lydgate was an arrogant
17990: young fellow, and yet ready for the sake of ultimately predominating to
17991: show a crawling subservience to Bulstrode. That Mr. Farebrother, whose
17992: name was a chief flag of the anti-Bulstrode party, always defended
17993: Lydgate and made a friend of him, was referred to Farebrother’s
17994: unaccountable way of fighting on both sides.
17995: 
17996: Here was plenty of preparation for the outburst of professional disgust
17997: at the announcement of the laws Mr. Bulstrode was laying down for the
17998: direction of the New Hospital, which were the more exasperating because
17999: there was no present possibility of interfering with his will and
18000: pleasure, everybody except Lord Medlicote having refused help towards
18001: the building, on the ground that they preferred giving to the Old
18002: Infirmary. Mr. Bulstrode met all the expenses, and had ceased to be
18003: sorry that he was purchasing the right to carry out his notions of
18004: improvement without hindrance from prejudiced coadjutors; but he had
18005: had to spend large sums, and the building had lingered. Caleb Garth had
18006: undertaken it, had failed during its progress, and before the interior
18007: fittings were begun had retired from the management of the business;
18008: and when referring to the Hospital he often said that however Bulstrode
18009: might ring if you tried him, he liked good solid carpentry and masonry,
18010: and had a notion both of drains and chimneys. In fact, the Hospital had
18011: become an object of intense interest to Bulstrode, and he would
18012: willingly have continued to spare a large yearly sum that he might rule
18013: it dictatorially without any Board; but he had another favorite object
18014: which also required money for its accomplishment: he wished to buy some
18015: land in the neighborhood of Middlemarch, and therefore he wished to get
18016: considerable contributions towards maintaining the Hospital. Meanwhile
18017: he framed his plan of management. The Hospital was to be reserved for
18018: fever in all its forms; Lydgate was to be chief medical superintendent,
18019: that he might have free authority to pursue all comparative
18020: investigations which his studies, particularly in Paris, had shown him
18021: the importance of, the other medical visitors having a consultative
18022: influence, but no power to contravene Lydgate’s ultimate decisions; and
18023: the general management was to be lodged exclusively in the hands of
18024: five directors associated with Mr. Bulstrode, who were to have votes in
18025: the ratio of their contributions, the Board itself filling up any
18026: vacancy in its numbers, and no mob of small contributors being admitted
18027: to a share of government.
18028: 
18029: There was an immediate refusal on the part of every medical man in the
18030: town to become a visitor at the Fever Hospital.
18031: 
18032: “Very well,” said Lydgate to Mr. Bulstrode, “we have a capital
18033: house-surgeon and dispenser, a clear-headed, neat-handed fellow; we’ll
18034: get Webbe from Crabsley, as good a country practitioner as any of them,
18035: to come over twice a-week, and in case of any exceptional operation,
18036: Protheroe will come from Brassing. I must work the harder, that’s all,
18037: and I have given up my post at the Infirmary. The plan will flourish in
18038: spite of them, and then they’ll be glad to come in. Things can’t last
18039: as they are: there must be all sorts of reform soon, and then young
18040: fellows may be glad to come and study here.” Lydgate was in high
18041: spirits.
18042: 
18043: “I shall not flinch, you may depend upon it, Mr. Lydgate,” said Mr.
18044: Bulstrode. “While I see you carrying out high intentions with vigor,
18045: you shall have my unfailing support. And I have humble confidence that
18046: the blessing which has hitherto attended my efforts against the spirit
18047: of evil in this town will not be withdrawn. Suitable directors to
18048: assist me I have no doubt of securing. Mr. Brooke of Tipton has already
18049: given me his concurrence, and a pledge to contribute yearly: he has not
18050: specified the sum—probably not a great one. But he will be a useful
18051: member of the board.”
18052: 
18053: A useful member was perhaps to be defined as one who would originate
18054: nothing, and always vote with Mr. Bulstrode.
18055: 
18056: The medical aversion to Lydgate was hardly disguised now. Neither Dr.
18057: Sprague nor Dr. Minchin said that he disliked Lydgate’s knowledge, or
18058: his disposition to improve treatment: what they disliked was his
18059: arrogance, which nobody felt to be altogether deniable. They implied
18060: that he was insolent, pretentious, and given to that reckless
18061: innovation for the sake of noise and show which was the essence of the
18062: charlatan.
18063: 
18064: The word charlatan once thrown on the air could not be let drop. In
18065: those days the world was agitated about the wondrous doings of Mr. St.
18066: John Long, “noblemen and gentlemen” attesting his extraction of a fluid
18067: like mercury from the temples of a patient.
18068: 
18069: Mr. Toller remarked one day, smilingly, to Mrs. Taft, that “Bulstrode
18070: had found a man to suit him in Lydgate; a charlatan in religion is sure
18071: to like other sorts of charlatans.”
18072: 
18073: “Yes, indeed, I can imagine,” said Mrs. Taft, keeping the number of
18074: thirty stitches carefully in her mind all the while; “there are so many
18075: of that sort. I remember Mr. Cheshire, with his irons, trying to make
18076: people straight when the Almighty had made them crooked.”
18077: 
18078: “No, no,” said Mr. Toller, “Cheshire was all right—all fair and above
18079: board. But there’s St. John Long—that’s the kind of fellow we call a
18080: charlatan, advertising cures in ways nobody knows anything about: a
18081: fellow who wants to make a noise by pretending to go deeper than other
18082: people. The other day he was pretending to tap a man’s brain and get
18083: quicksilver out of it.”
18084: 
18085: “Good gracious! what dreadful trifling with people’s constitutions!”
18086: said Mrs. Taft.
18087: 
18088: After this, it came to be held in various quarters that Lydgate played
18089: even with respectable constitutions for his own purposes, and how much
18090: more likely that in his flighty experimenting he should make sixes and
18091: sevens of hospital patients. Especially it was to be expected, as the
18092: landlady of the Tankard had said, that he would recklessly cut up their
18093: dead bodies. For Lydgate having attended Mrs. Goby, who died apparently
18094: of a heart-disease not very clearly expressed in the symptoms, too
18095: daringly asked leave of her relatives to open the body, and thus gave
18096: an offence quickly spreading beyond Parley Street, where that lady had
18097: long resided on an income such as made this association of her body
18098: with the victims of Burke and Hare a flagrant insult to her memory.
18099: 
18100: Affairs were in this stage when Lydgate opened the subject of the
18101: Hospital to Dorothea. We see that he was bearing enmity and silly
18102: misconception with much spirit, aware that they were partly created by
18103: his good share of success.
18104: 
18105: “They will not drive me away,” he said, talking confidentially in Mr.
18106: Farebrother’s study. “I have got a good opportunity here, for the ends
18107: I care most about; and I am pretty sure to get income enough for our
18108: wants. By-and-by I shall go on as quietly as possible: I have no
18109: seductions now away from home and work. And I am more and more
18110: convinced that it will be possible to demonstrate the homogeneous
18111: origin of all the tissues. Raspail and others are on the same track,
18112: and I have been losing time.”
18113: 
18114: “I have no power of prophecy there,” said Mr. Farebrother, who had been
18115: puffing at his pipe thoughtfully while Lydgate talked; “but as to the
18116: hostility in the town, you’ll weather it if you are prudent.”
18117: 
18118: “How am I to be prudent?” said Lydgate, “I just do what comes before me
18119: to do. I can’t help people’s ignorance and spite, any more than
18120: Vesalius could. It isn’t possible to square one’s conduct to silly
18121: conclusions which nobody can foresee.”
18122: 
18123: “Quite true; I didn’t mean that. I meant only two things. One is, keep
18124: yourself as separable from Bulstrode as you can: of course, you can go
18125: on doing good work of your own by his help; but don’t get tied. Perhaps
18126: it seems like personal feeling in me to say so—and there’s a good deal
18127: of that, I own—but personal feeling is not always in the wrong if you
18128: boil it down to the impressions which make it simply an opinion.”
18129: 
18130: “Bulstrode is nothing to me,” said Lydgate, carelessly, “except on
18131: public grounds. As to getting very closely united to him, I am not fond
18132: enough of him for that. But what was the other thing you meant?” said
18133: Lydgate, who was nursing his leg as comfortably as possible, and
18134: feeling in no great need of advice.
18135: 
18136: “Why, this. Take care—_experto crede_—take care not to get hampered
18137: about money matters. I know, by a word you let fall one day, that you
18138: don’t like my playing at cards so much for money. You are right enough
18139: there. But try and keep clear of wanting small sums that you haven’t
18140: got. I am perhaps talking rather superfluously; but a man likes to
18141: assume superiority over himself, by holding up his bad example and
18142: sermonizing on it.”
18143: 
18144: Lydgate took Mr. Farebrother’s hints very cordially, though he would
18145: hardly have borne them from another man. He could not help remembering
18146: that he had lately made some debts, but these had seemed inevitable,
18147: and he had no intention now to do more than keep house in a simple way.
18148: The furniture for which he owed would not want renewing; nor even the
18149: stock of wine for a long while.
18150: 
18151: Many thoughts cheered him at that time—and justly. A man conscious of
18152: enthusiasm for worthy aims is sustained under petty hostilities by the
18153: memory of great workers who had to fight their way not without wounds,
18154: and who hover in his mind as patron saints, invisibly helping. At home,
18155: that same evening when he had been chatting with Mr. Farebrother, he
18156: had his long legs stretched on the sofa, his head thrown back, and his
18157: hands clasped behind it according to his favorite ruminating attitude,
18158: while Rosamond sat at the piano, and played one tune after another, of
18159: which her husband only knew (like the emotional elephant he was!) that
18160: they fell in with his mood as if they had been melodious sea-breezes.
18161: 
18162: There was something very fine in Lydgate’s look just then, and any one
18163: might have been encouraged to bet on his achievement. In his dark eyes
18164: and on his mouth and brow there was that placidity which comes from the
18165: fulness of contemplative thought—the mind not searching, but beholding,
18166: and the glance seeming to be filled with what is behind it.
18167: 
18168: Presently Rosamond left the piano and seated herself on a chair close
18169: to the sofa and opposite her husband’s face.
18170: 
18171: “Is that enough music for you, my lord?” she said, folding her hands
18172: before her and putting on a little air of meekness.
18173: 
18174: “Yes, dear, if you are tired,” said Lydgate, gently, turning his eyes
18175: and resting them on her, but not otherwise moving. Rosamond’s presence
18176: at that moment was perhaps no more than a spoonful brought to the lake,
18177: and her woman’s instinct in this matter was not dull.
18178: 
18179: “What is absorbing you?” she said, leaning forward and bringing her
18180: face nearer to his.
18181: 
18182: He moved his hands and placed them gently behind her shoulders.
18183: 
18184: “I am thinking of a great fellow, who was about as old as I am three
18185: hundred years ago, and had already begun a new era in anatomy.”
18186: 
18187: “I can’t guess,” said Rosamond, shaking her head. “We used to play at
18188: guessing historical characters at Mrs. Lemon’s, but not anatomists.”
18189: 
18190: “I’ll tell you. His name was Vesalius. And the only way he could get to
18191: know anatomy as he did, was by going to snatch bodies at night, from
18192: graveyards and places of execution.”
18193: 
18194: “Oh!” said Rosamond, with a look of disgust on her pretty face, “I am
18195: very glad you are not Vesalius. I should have thought he might find
18196: some less horrible way than that.”
18197: 
18198: “No, he couldn’t,” said Lydgate, going on too earnestly to take much
18199: notice of her answer. “He could only get a complete skeleton by
18200: snatching the whitened bones of a criminal from the gallows, and
18201: burying them, and fetching them away by bits secretly, in the dead of
18202: night.”
18203: 
18204: “I hope he is not one of your great heroes,” said Rosamond, half
18205: playfully, half anxiously, “else I shall have you getting up in the
18206: night to go to St. Peter’s churchyard. You know how angry you told me
18207: the people were about Mrs. Goby. You have enemies enough already.”
18208: 
18209: “So had Vesalius, Rosy. No wonder the medical fogies in Middlemarch are
18210: jealous, when some of the greatest doctors living were fierce upon
18211: Vesalius because they had believed in Galen, and he showed that Galen
18212: was wrong. They called him a liar and a poisonous monster. But the
18213: facts of the human frame were on his side; and so he got the better of
18214: them.”
18215: 
18216: “And what happened to him afterwards?” said Rosamond, with some
18217: interest.
18218: 
18219: “Oh, he had a good deal of fighting to the last. And they did
18220: exasperate him enough at one time to make him burn a good deal of his
18221: work. Then he got shipwrecked just as he was coming from Jerusalem to
18222: take a great chair at Padua. He died rather miserably.”
18223: 
18224: There was a moment’s pause before Rosamond said, “Do you know, Tertius,
18225: I often wish you had not been a medical man.”
18226: 
18227: “Nay, Rosy, don’t say that,” said Lydgate, drawing her closer to him.
18228: “That is like saying you wish you had married another man.”
18229: 
18230: “Not at all; you are clever enough for anything: you might easily have
18231: been something else. And your cousins at Quallingham all think that you
18232: have sunk below them in your choice of a profession.”
18233: 
18234: “The cousins at Quallingham may go to the devil!” said Lydgate, with
18235: scorn. “It was like their impudence if they said anything of the sort
18236: to you.”
18237: 
18238: “Still,” said Rosamond, “I do _not_ think it is a nice profession,
18239: dear.” We know that she had much quiet perseverance in her opinion.
18240: 
18241: “It is the grandest profession in the world, Rosamond,” said Lydgate,
18242: gravely. “And to say that you love me without loving the medical man in
18243: me, is the same sort of thing as to say that you like eating a peach
18244: but don’t like its flavor. Don’t say that again, dear, it pains me.”
18245: 
18246: “Very well, Doctor Grave-face,” said Rosy, dimpling, “I will declare in
18247: future that I dote on skeletons, and body-snatchers, and bits of things
18248: in phials, and quarrels with everybody, that end in your dying
18249: miserably.”
18250: 
18251: “No, no, not so bad as that,” said Lydgate, giving up remonstrance and
18252: petting her resignedly.
18253: 
18254: 
18255: 
18256: 
18257: CHAPTER XLVI.
18258: 
18259: Pues no podemos haber aquello que queremos, queramos aquello que
18260: podremos.
18261: 
18262: Since we cannot get what we like, let us like what we can get.—_Spanish
18263: Proverb_.
18264: 
18265: 
18266: While Lydgate, safely married and with the Hospital under his command,
18267: felt himself struggling for Medical Reform against Middlemarch,
18268: Middlemarch was becoming more and more conscious of the national
18269: struggle for another kind of Reform.
18270: 
18271: By the time that Lord John Russell’s measure was being debated in the
18272: House of Commons, there was a new political animation in Middlemarch,
18273: and a new definition of parties which might show a decided change of
18274: balance if a new election came. And there were some who already
18275: predicted this event, declaring that a Reform Bill would never be
18276: carried by the actual Parliament. This was what Will Ladislaw dwelt on
18277: to Mr. Brooke as a reason for congratulation that he had not yet tried
18278: his strength at the hustings.
18279: 
18280: “Things will grow and ripen as if it were a comet year,” said Will.
18281: “The public temper will soon get to a cometary heat, now the question
18282: of Reform has set in. There is likely to be another election before
18283: long, and by that time Middlemarch will have got more ideas into its
18284: head. What we have to work at now is the ‘Pioneer’ and political
18285: meetings.”
18286: 
18287: “Quite right, Ladislaw; we shall make a new thing of opinion here,”
18288: said Mr. Brooke. “Only I want to keep myself independent about Reform,
18289: you know; I don’t want to go too far. I want to take up Wilberforce’s
18290: and Romilly’s line, you know, and work at Negro Emancipation, Criminal
18291: Law—that kind of thing. But of course I should support Grey.”
18292: 
18293: “If you go in for the principle of Reform, you must be prepared to take
18294: what the situation offers,” said Will. “If everybody pulled for his own
18295: bit against everybody else, the whole question would go to tatters.”
18296: 
18297: “Yes, yes, I agree with you—I quite take that point of view. I should
18298: put it in that light. I should support Grey, you know. But I don’t want
18299: to change the balance of the constitution, and I don’t think Grey
18300: would.”
18301: 
18302: “But that is what the country wants,” said Will. “Else there would be
18303: no meaning in political unions or any other movement that knows what
18304: it’s about. It wants to have a House of Commons which is not weighted
18305: with nominees of the landed class, but with representatives of the
18306: other interests. And as to contending for a reform short of that, it is
18307: like asking for a bit of an avalanche which has already begun to
18308: thunder.”
18309: 
18310: “That is fine, Ladislaw: that is the way to put it. Write that down,
18311: now. We must begin to get documents about the feeling of the country,
18312: as well as the machine-breaking and general distress.”
18313: 
18314: “As to documents,” said Will, “a two-inch card will hold plenty. A few
18315: rows of figures are enough to deduce misery from, and a few more will
18316: show the rate at which the political determination of the people is
18317: growing.”
18318: 
18319: “Good: draw that out a little more at length, Ladislaw. That is an
18320: idea, now: write it out in the ‘Pioneer.’ Put the figures and deduce
18321: the misery, you know; and put the other figures and deduce—and so on.
18322: You have a way of putting things. Burke, now:—when I think of Burke, I
18323: can’t help wishing somebody had a pocket-borough to give you, Ladislaw.
18324: You’d never get elected, you know. And we shall always want talent in
18325: the House: reform as we will, we shall always want talent. That
18326: avalanche and the thunder, now, was really a little like Burke. I want
18327: that sort of thing—not ideas, you know, but a way of putting them.”
18328: 
18329: “Pocket-boroughs would be a fine thing,” said Ladislaw, “if they were
18330: always in the right pocket, and there were always a Burke at hand.”
18331: 
18332: Will was not displeased with that complimentary comparison, even from
18333: Mr. Brooke; for it is a little too trying to human flesh to be
18334: conscious of expressing one’s self better than others and never to have
18335: it noticed, and in the general dearth of admiration for the right
18336: thing, even a chance bray of applause falling exactly in time is rather
18337: fortifying. Will felt that his literary refinements were usually beyond
18338: the limits of Middlemarch perception; nevertheless, he was beginning
18339: thoroughly to like the work of which when he began he had said to
18340: himself rather languidly, “Why not?”—and he studied the political
18341: situation with as ardent an interest as he had ever given to poetic
18342: metres or mediaevalism. It is undeniable that but for the desire to be
18343: where Dorothea was, and perhaps the want of knowing what else to do,
18344: Will would not at this time have been meditating on the needs of the
18345: English people or criticising English statesmanship: he would probably
18346: have been rambling in Italy sketching plans for several dramas, trying
18347: prose and finding it too jejune, trying verse and finding it too
18348: artificial, beginning to copy “bits” from old pictures, leaving off
18349: because they were “no good,” and observing that, after all,
18350: self-culture was the principal point; while in politics he would have
18351: been sympathizing warmly with liberty and progress in general. Our
18352: sense of duty must often wait for some work which shall take the place
18353: of dilettanteism and make us feel that the quality of our action is not
18354: a matter of indifference.
18355: 
18356: Ladislaw had now accepted his bit of work, though it was not that
18357: indeterminate loftiest thing which he had once dreamed of as alone
18358: worthy of continuous effort. His nature warmed easily in the presence
18359: of subjects which were visibly mixed with life and action, and the
18360: easily stirred rebellion in him helped the glow of public spirit. In
18361: spite of Mr. Casaubon and the banishment from Lowick, he was rather
18362: happy; getting a great deal of fresh knowledge in a vivid way and for
18363: practical purposes, and making the “Pioneer” celebrated as far as
18364: Brassing (never mind the smallness of the area; the writing was not
18365: worse than much that reaches the four corners of the earth).
18366: 
18367: Mr. Brooke was occasionally irritating; but Will’s impatience was
18368: relieved by the division of his time between visits to the Grange and
18369: retreats to his Middlemarch lodgings, which gave variety to his life.
18370: 
18371: “Shift the pegs a little,” he said to himself, “and Mr. Brooke might be
18372: in the Cabinet, while I was Under-Secretary. That is the common order
18373: of things: the little waves make the large ones and are of the same
18374: pattern. I am better here than in the sort of life Mr. Casaubon would
18375: have trained me for, where the doing would be all laid down by a
18376: precedent too rigid for me to react upon. I don’t care for prestige or
18377: high pay.”
18378: 
18379: As Lydgate had said of him, he was a sort of gypsy, rather enjoying the
18380: sense of belonging to no class; he had a feeling of romance in his
18381: position, and a pleasant consciousness of creating a little surprise
18382: wherever he went. That sort of enjoyment had been disturbed when he had
18383: felt some new distance between himself and Dorothea in their accidental
18384: meeting at Lydgate’s, and his irritation had gone out towards Mr.
18385: Casaubon, who had declared beforehand that Will would lose caste. “I
18386: never had any caste,” he would have said, if that prophecy had been
18387: uttered to him, and the quick blood would have come and gone like
18388: breath in his transparent skin. But it is one thing to like defiance,
18389: and another thing to like its consequences.
18390: 
18391: Meanwhile, the town opinion about the new editor of the “Pioneer” was
18392: tending to confirm Mr. Casaubon’s view. Will’s relationship in that
18393: distinguished quarter did not, like Lydgate’s high connections, serve
18394: as an advantageous introduction: if it was rumored that young Ladislaw
18395: was Mr. Casaubon’s nephew or cousin, it was also rumored that “Mr.
18396: Casaubon would have nothing to do with him.”
18397: 
18398: “Brooke has taken him up,” said Mr. Hawley, “because that is what no
18399: man in his senses could have expected. Casaubon has devilish good
18400: reasons, you may be sure, for turning the cold shoulder on a young
18401: fellow whose bringing-up he paid for. Just like Brooke—one of those
18402: fellows who would praise a cat to sell a horse.”
18403: 
18404: And some oddities of Will’s, more or less poetical, appeared to support
18405: Mr. Keck, the editor of the “Trumpet,” in asserting that Ladislaw, if
18406: the truth were known, was not only a Polish emissary but crack-brained,
18407: which accounted for the preternatural quickness and glibness of his
18408: speech when he got on to a platform—as he did whenever he had an
18409: opportunity, speaking with a facility which cast reflections on solid
18410: Englishmen generally. It was disgusting to Keck to see a strip of a
18411: fellow, with light curls round his head, get up and speechify by the
18412: hour against institutions “which had existed when he was in his
18413: cradle.” And in a leading article of the “Trumpet,” Keck characterized
18414: Ladislaw’s speech at a Reform meeting as “the violence of an
18415: energumen—a miserable effort to shroud in the brilliancy of fireworks
18416: the daring of irresponsible statements and the poverty of a knowledge
18417: which was of the cheapest and most recent description.”
18418: 
18419: “That was a rattling article yesterday, Keck,” said Dr. Sprague, with
18420: sarcastic intentions. “But what is an energumen?”
18421: 
18422: “Oh, a term that came up in the French Revolution,” said Keck.
18423: 
18424: This dangerous aspect of Ladislaw was strangely contrasted with other
18425: habits which became matter of remark. He had a fondness, half artistic,
18426: half affectionate, for little children—the smaller they were on
18427: tolerably active legs, and the funnier their clothing, the better Will
18428: liked to surprise and please them. We know that in Rome he was given to
18429: ramble about among the poor people, and the taste did not quit him in
18430: Middlemarch.
18431: 
18432: He had somehow picked up a troop of droll children, little hatless boys
18433: with their galligaskins much worn and scant shirting to hang out,
18434: little girls who tossed their hair out of their eyes to look at him,
18435: and guardian brothers at the mature age of seven. This troop he had led
18436: out on gypsy excursions to Halsell Wood at nutting-time, and since the
18437: cold weather had set in he had taken them on a clear day to gather
18438: sticks for a bonfire in the hollow of a hillside, where he drew out a
18439: small feast of gingerbread for them, and improvised a Punch-and-Judy
18440: drama with some private home-made puppets. Here was one oddity. Another
18441: was, that in houses where he got friendly, he was given to stretch
18442: himself at full length on the rug while he talked, and was apt to be
18443: discovered in this attitude by occasional callers for whom such an
18444: irregularity was likely to confirm the notions of his dangerously mixed
18445: blood and general laxity.
18446: 
18447: But Will’s articles and speeches naturally recommended him in families
18448: which the new strictness of party division had marked off on the side
18449: of Reform. He was invited to Mr. Bulstrode’s; but here he could not lie
18450: down on the rug, and Mrs. Bulstrode felt that his mode of talking about
18451: Catholic countries, as if there were any truce with Antichrist,
18452: illustrated the usual tendency to unsoundness in intellectual men.
18453: 
18454: At Mr. Farebrother’s, however, whom the irony of events had brought on
18455: the same side with Bulstrode in the national movement, Will became a
18456: favorite with the ladies; especially with little Miss Noble, whom it
18457: was one of his oddities to escort when he met her in the street with
18458: her little basket, giving her his arm in the eyes of the town, and
18459: insisting on going with her to pay some call where she distributed her
18460: small filchings from her own share of sweet things.
18461: 
18462: But the house where he visited oftenest and lay most on the rug was
18463: Lydgate’s. The two men were not at all alike, but they agreed none the
18464: worse. Lydgate was abrupt but not irritable, taking little notice of
18465: megrims in healthy people; and Ladislaw did not usually throw away his
18466: susceptibilities on those who took no notice of them. With Rosamond, on
18467: the other hand, he pouted and was wayward—nay, often uncomplimentary,
18468: much to her inward surprise; nevertheless he was gradually becoming
18469: necessary to her entertainment by his companionship in her music, his
18470: varied talk, and his freedom from the grave preoccupation which, with
18471: all her husband’s tenderness and indulgence, often made his manners
18472: unsatisfactory to her, and confirmed her dislike of the medical
18473: profession.
18474: 
18475: Lydgate, inclined to be sarcastic on the superstitious faith of the
18476: people in the efficacy of “the bill,” while nobody cared about the low
18477: state of pathology, sometimes assailed Will with troublesome questions.
18478: One evening in March, Rosamond in her cherry-colored dress with
18479: swansdown trimming about the throat sat at the tea-table; Lydgate,
18480: lately come in tired from his outdoor work, was seated sideways on an
18481: easy-chair by the fire with one leg over the elbow, his brow looking a
18482: little troubled as his eyes rambled over the columns of the “Pioneer,”
18483: while Rosamond, having noticed that he was perturbed, avoided looking
18484: at him, and inwardly thanked heaven that she herself had not a moody
18485: disposition. Will Ladislaw was stretched on the rug contemplating the
18486: curtain-pole abstractedly, and humming very low the notes of “When
18487: first I saw thy face;” while the house spaniel, also stretched out with
18488: small choice of room, looked from between his paws at the usurper of
18489: the rug with silent but strong objection.
18490: 
18491: Rosamond bringing Lydgate his cup of tea, he threw down the paper, and
18492: said to Will, who had started up and gone to the table—
18493: 
18494: “It’s no use your puffing Brooke as a reforming landlord, Ladislaw:
18495: they only pick the more holes in his coat in the ‘Trumpet.’”
18496: 
18497: “No matter; those who read the ‘Pioneer’ don’t read the ‘Trumpet,’”
18498: said Will, swallowing his tea and walking about. “Do you suppose the
18499: public reads with a view to its own conversion? We should have a
18500: witches’ brewing with a vengeance then—‘Mingle, mingle, mingle, mingle,
18501: You that mingle may’—and nobody would know which side he was going to
18502: take.”
18503: 
18504: “Farebrother says, he doesn’t believe Brooke would get elected if the
18505: opportunity came: the very men who profess to be for him would bring
18506: another member out of the bag at the right moment.”
18507: 
18508: “There’s no harm in trying. It’s good to have resident members.”
18509: 
18510: “Why?” said Lydgate, who was much given to use that inconvenient word
18511: in a curt tone.
18512: 
18513: “They represent the local stupidity better,” said Will, laughing, and
18514: shaking his curls; “and they are kept on their best behavior in the
18515: neighborhood. Brooke is not a bad fellow, but he has done some good
18516: things on his estate that he never would have done but for this
18517: Parliamentary bite.”
18518: 
18519: “He’s not fitted to be a public man,” said Lydgate, with contemptuous
18520: decision. “He would disappoint everybody who counted on him: I can see
18521: that at the Hospital. Only, there Bulstrode holds the reins and drives
18522: him.”
18523: 
18524: “That depends on how you fix your standard of public men,” said Will.
18525: “He’s good enough for the occasion: when the people have made up their
18526: mind as they are making it up now, they don’t want a man—they only want
18527: a vote.”
18528: 
18529: “That is the way with you political writers, Ladislaw—crying up a
18530: measure as if it were a universal cure, and crying up men who are a
18531: part of the very disease that wants curing.”
18532: 
18533: “Why not? Men may help to cure themselves off the face of the land
18534: without knowing it,” said Will, who could find reasons impromptu, when
18535: he had not thought of a question beforehand.
18536: 
18537: “That is no excuse for encouraging the superstitious exaggeration of
18538: hopes about this particular measure, helping the cry to swallow it
18539: whole and to send up voting popinjays who are good for nothing but to
18540: carry it. You go against rottenness, and there is nothing more
18541: thoroughly rotten than making people believe that society can be cured
18542: by a political hocus-pocus.”
18543: 
18544: “That’s very fine, my dear fellow. But your cure must begin somewhere,
18545: and put it that a thousand things which debase a population can never
18546: be reformed without this particular reform to begin with. Look what
18547: Stanley said the other day—that the House had been tinkering long
18548: enough at small questions of bribery, inquiring whether this or that
18549: voter has had a guinea when everybody knows that the seats have been
18550: sold wholesale. Wait for wisdom and conscience in public
18551: agents—fiddlestick! The only conscience we can trust to is the massive
18552: sense of wrong in a class, and the best wisdom that will work is the
18553: wisdom of balancing claims. That’s my text—which side is injured? I
18554: support the man who supports their claims; not the virtuous upholder of
18555: the wrong.”
18556: 
18557: “That general talk about a particular case is mere question begging,
18558: Ladislaw. When I say, I go in for the dose that cures, it doesn’t
18559: follow that I go in for opium in a given case of gout.”
18560: 
18561: “I am not begging the question we are upon—whether we are to try for
18562: nothing till we find immaculate men to work with. Should you go on that
18563: plan? If there were one man who would carry you a medical reform and
18564: another who would oppose it, should you inquire which had the better
18565: motives or even the better brains?”
18566: 
18567: “Oh, of course,” said Lydgate, seeing himself checkmated by a move
18568: which he had often used himself, “if one did not work with such men as
18569: are at hand, things must come to a dead-lock. Suppose the worst opinion
18570: in the town about Bulstrode were a true one, that would not make it
18571: less true that he has the sense and the resolution to do what I think
18572: ought to be done in the matters I know and care most about; but that is
18573: the only ground on which I go with him,” Lydgate added rather proudly,
18574: bearing in mind Mr. Farebrother’s remarks. “He is nothing to me
18575: otherwise; I would not cry him up on any personal ground—I would keep
18576: clear of that.”
18577: 
18578: “Do you mean that I cry up Brooke on any personal ground?” said Will
18579: Ladislaw, nettled, and turning sharp round. For the first time he felt
18580: offended with Lydgate; not the less so, perhaps, because he would have
18581: declined any close inquiry into the growth of his relation to Mr.
18582: Brooke.
18583: 
18584: “Not at all,” said Lydgate, “I was simply explaining my own action. I
18585: meant that a man may work for a special end with others whose motives
18586: and general course are equivocal, if he is quite sure of his personal
18587: independence, and that he is not working for his private
18588: interest—either place or money.”
18589: 
18590: “Then, why don’t you extend your liberality to others?” said Will,
18591: still nettled. “My personal independence is as important to me as yours
18592: is to you. You have no more reason to imagine that I have personal
18593: expectations from Brooke, than I have to imagine that you have personal
18594: expectations from Bulstrode. Motives are points of honor, I
18595: suppose—nobody can prove them. But as to money and place in the world,”
18596: Will ended, tossing back his head, “I think it is pretty clear that I
18597: am not determined by considerations of that sort.”
18598: 
18599: “You quite mistake me, Ladislaw,” said Lydgate, surprised. He had been
18600: preoccupied with his own vindication, and had been blind to what
18601: Ladislaw might infer on his own account. “I beg your pardon for
18602: unintentionally annoying you. In fact, I should rather attribute to you
18603: a romantic disregard of your own worldly interests. On the political
18604: question, I referred simply to intellectual bias.”
18605: 
18606: “How very unpleasant you both are this evening!” said Rosamond. “I
18607: cannot conceive why money should have been referred to. Politics and
18608: Medicine are sufficiently disagreeable to quarrel upon. You can both of
18609: you go on quarrelling with all the world and with each other on those
18610: two topics.”
18611: 
18612: Rosamond looked mildly neutral as she said this, rising to ring the
18613: bell, and then crossing to her work-table.
18614: 
18615: “Poor Rosy!” said Lydgate, putting out his hand to her as she was
18616: passing him. “Disputation is not amusing to cherubs. Have some music.
18617: Ask Ladislaw to sing with you.”
18618: 
18619: When Will was gone Rosamond said to her husband, “What put you out of
18620: temper this evening, Tertius?”
18621: 
18622: “Me? It was Ladislaw who was out of temper. He is like a bit of
18623: tinder.”
18624: 
18625: “But I mean, before that. Something had vexed you before you came in,
18626: you looked cross. And that made you begin to dispute with Mr. Ladislaw.
18627: You hurt me very much when you look so, Tertius.”
18628: 
18629: “Do I? Then I am a brute,” said Lydgate, caressing her penitently.
18630: 
18631: “What vexed you?”
18632: 
18633: “Oh, outdoor things—business.” It was really a letter insisting on the
18634: payment of a bill for furniture. But Rosamond was expecting to have a
18635: baby, and Lydgate wished to save her from any perturbation.
18636: 
18637: 
18638: 
18639: 
18640: CHAPTER XLVII.
18641: 
18642: Was never true love loved in vain,
18643: For truest love is highest gain.
18644: No art can make it: it must spring
18645: Where elements are fostering.
18646: So in heaven’s spot and hour
18647: Springs the little native flower,
18648: Downward root and upward eye,
18649: Shapen by the earth and sky.
18650: 
18651: 
18652: It happened to be on a Saturday evening that Will Ladislaw had that
18653: little discussion with Lydgate. Its effect when he went to his own
18654: rooms was to make him sit up half the night, thinking over again, under
18655: a new irritation, all that he had before thought of his having settled
18656: in Middlemarch and harnessed himself with Mr. Brooke. Hesitations
18657: before he had taken the step had since turned into susceptibility to
18658: every hint that he would have been wiser not to take it; and hence came
18659: his heat towards Lydgate—a heat which still kept him restless. Was he
18660: not making a fool of himself?—and at a time when he was more than ever
18661: conscious of being something better than a fool? And for what end?
18662: 
18663: Well, for no definite end. True, he had dreamy visions of
18664: possibilities: there is no human being who having both passions and
18665: thoughts does not think in consequence of his passions—does not find
18666: images rising in his mind which soothe the passion with hope or sting
18667: it with dread. But this, which happens to us all, happens to some with
18668: a wide difference; and Will was not one of those whose wit “keeps the
18669: roadway:” he had his bypaths where there were little joys of his own
18670: choosing, such as gentlemen cantering on the highroad might have
18671: thought rather idiotic. The way in which he made a sort of happiness
18672: for himself out of his feeling for Dorothea was an example of this. It
18673: may seem strange, but it is the fact, that the ordinary vulgar vision
18674: of which Mr. Casaubon suspected him—namely, that Dorothea might become
18675: a widow, and that the interest he had established in her mind might
18676: turn into acceptance of him as a husband—had no tempting, arresting
18677: power over him; he did not live in the scenery of such an event, and
18678: follow it out, as we all do with that imagined “otherwise” which is our
18679: practical heaven. It was not only that he was unwilling to entertain
18680: thoughts which could be accused of baseness, and was already uneasy in
18681: the sense that he had to justify himself from the charge of
18682: ingratitude—the latent consciousness of many other barriers between
18683: himself and Dorothea besides the existence of her husband, had helped
18684: to turn away his imagination from speculating on what might befall Mr.
18685: Casaubon. And there were yet other reasons. Will, we know, could not
18686: bear the thought of any flaw appearing in his crystal: he was at once
18687: exasperated and delighted by the calm freedom with which Dorothea
18688: looked at him and spoke to him, and there was something so exquisite in
18689: thinking of her just as she was, that he could not long for a change
18690: which must somehow change her. Do we not shun the street version of a
18691: fine melody?—or shrink from the news that the rarity—some bit of
18692: chiselling or engraving perhaps—which we have dwelt on even with
18693: exultation in the trouble it has cost us to snatch glimpses of it, is
18694: really not an uncommon thing, and may be obtained as an every-day
18695: possession? Our good depends on the quality and breadth of our emotion;
18696: and to Will, a creature who cared little for what are called the solid
18697: things of life and greatly for its subtler influences, to have within
18698: him such a feeling as he had towards Dorothea, was like the inheritance
18699: of a fortune. What others might have called the futility of his
18700: passion, made an additional delight for his imagination: he was
18701: conscious of a generous movement, and of verifying in his own
18702: experience that higher love-poetry which had charmed his fancy.
18703: Dorothea, he said to himself, was forever enthroned in his soul: no
18704: other woman could sit higher than her footstool; and if he could have
18705: written out in immortal syllables the effect she wrought within him, he
18706: might have boasted after the example of old Drayton, that,—
18707: 
18708: “Queens hereafter might be glad to live
18709: Upon the alms of her superfluous praise.”
18710: 
18711: 
18712: But this result was questionable. And what else could he do for
18713: Dorothea? What was his devotion worth to her? It was impossible to
18714: tell. He would not go out of her reach. He saw no creature among her
18715: friends to whom he could believe that she spoke with the same simple
18716: confidence as to him. She had once said that she would like him to
18717: stay; and stay he would, whatever fire-breathing dragons might hiss
18718: around her.
18719: 
18720: This had always been the conclusion of Will’s hesitations. But he was
18721: not without contradictoriness and rebellion even towards his own
18722: resolve. He had often got irritated, as he was on this particular
18723: night, by some outside demonstration that his public exertions with Mr.
18724: Brooke as a chief could not seem as heroic as he would like them to be,
18725: and this was always associated with the other ground of irritation—that
18726: notwithstanding his sacrifice of dignity for Dorothea’s sake, he could
18727: hardly ever see her. Whereupon, not being able to contradict these
18728: unpleasant facts, he contradicted his own strongest bias and said, “I
18729: am a fool.”
18730: 
18731: Nevertheless, since the inward debate necessarily turned on Dorothea,
18732: he ended, as he had done before, only by getting a livelier sense of
18733: what her presence would be to him; and suddenly reflecting that the
18734: morrow would be Sunday, he determined to go to Lowick Church and see
18735: her. He slept upon that idea, but when he was dressing in the rational
18736: morning light, Objection said—
18737: 
18738: “That will be a virtual defiance of Mr. Casaubon’s prohibition to visit
18739: Lowick, and Dorothea will be displeased.”
18740: 
18741: “Nonsense!” argued Inclination, “it would be too monstrous for him to
18742: hinder me from going out to a pretty country church on a spring
18743: morning. And Dorothea will be glad.”
18744: 
18745: “It will be clear to Mr. Casaubon that you have come either to annoy
18746: him or to see Dorothea.”
18747: 
18748: “It is not true that I go to annoy him, and why should I not go to see
18749: Dorothea? Is he to have everything to himself and be always
18750: comfortable? Let him smart a little, as other people are obliged to do.
18751: I have always liked the quaintness of the church and congregation;
18752: besides, I know the Tuckers: I shall go into their pew.”
18753: 
18754: Having silenced Objection by force of unreason, Will walked to Lowick
18755: as if he had been on the way to Paradise, crossing Halsell Common and
18756: skirting the wood, where the sunlight fell broadly under the budding
18757: boughs, bringing out the beauties of moss and lichen, and fresh green
18758: growths piercing the brown. Everything seemed to know that it was
18759: Sunday, and to approve of his going to Lowick Church. Will easily felt
18760: happy when nothing crossed his humor, and by this time the thought of
18761: vexing Mr. Casaubon had become rather amusing to him, making his face
18762: break into its merry smile, pleasant to see as the breaking of sunshine
18763: on the water—though the occasion was not exemplary. But most of us are
18764: apt to settle within ourselves that the man who blocks our way is
18765: odious, and not to mind causing him a little of the disgust which his
18766: personality excites in ourselves. Will went along with a small book
18767: under his arm and a hand in each side-pocket, never reading, but
18768: chanting a little, as he made scenes of what would happen in church and
18769: coming out. He was experimenting in tunes to suit some words of his
18770: own, sometimes trying a ready-made melody, sometimes improvising. The
18771: words were not exactly a hymn, but they certainly fitted his Sunday
18772: experience:—
18773: 
18774: “O me, O me, what frugal cheer
18775:     My love doth feed upon!
18776: A touch, a ray, that is not here,
18777:     A shadow that is gone:
18778: 
18779: “A dream of breath that might be near,
18780:     An inly-echoed tone,
18781: The thought that one may think me dear,
18782:     The place where one was known,
18783: 
18784: “The tremor of a banished fear,
18785:      An ill that was not done—
18786: O me, O me, what frugal cheer
18787:     My love doth feed upon!”
18788: 
18789: 
18790: Sometimes, when he took off his hat, shaking his head backward, and
18791: showing his delicate throat as he sang, he looked like an incarnation
18792: of the spring whose spirit filled the air—a bright creature, abundant
18793: in uncertain promises.
18794: 
18795: The bells were still ringing when he got to Lowick, and he went into
18796: the curate’s pew before any one else arrived there. But he was still
18797: left alone in it when the congregation had assembled. The curate’s pew
18798: was opposite the rector’s at the entrance of the small chancel, and
18799: Will had time to fear that Dorothea might not come while he looked
18800: round at the group of rural faces which made the congregation from year
18801: to year within the white-washed walls and dark old pews, hardly with
18802: more change than we see in the boughs of a tree which breaks here and
18803: there with age, but yet has young shoots. Mr. Rigg’s frog-face was
18804: something alien and unaccountable, but notwithstanding this shock to
18805: the order of things, there were still the Waules and the rural stock of
18806: the Powderells in their pews side by side; brother Samuel’s cheek had
18807: the same purple round as ever, and the three generations of decent
18808: cottagers came as of old with a sense of duty to their betters
18809: generally—the smaller children regarding Mr. Casaubon, who wore the
18810: black gown and mounted to the highest box, as probably the chief of all
18811: betters, and the one most awful if offended. Even in 1831 Lowick was at
18812: peace, not more agitated by Reform than by the solemn tenor of the
18813: Sunday sermon. The congregation had been used to seeing Will at church
18814: in former days, and no one took much note of him except the choir, who
18815: expected him to make a figure in the singing.
18816: 
18817: Dorothea did at last appear on this quaint background, walking up the
18818: short aisle in her white beaver bonnet and gray cloak—the same she had
18819: worn in the Vatican. Her face being, from her entrance, towards the
18820: chancel, even her shortsighted eyes soon discerned Will, but there was
18821: no outward show of her feeling except a slight paleness and a grave bow
18822: as she passed him. To his own surprise Will felt suddenly
18823: uncomfortable, and dared not look at her after they had bowed to each
18824: other. Two minutes later, when Mr. Casaubon came out of the vestry,
18825: and, entering the pew, seated himself in face of Dorothea, Will felt
18826: his paralysis more complete. He could look nowhere except at the choir
18827: in the little gallery over the vestry-door: Dorothea was perhaps
18828: pained, and he had made a wretched blunder. It was no longer amusing to
18829: vex Mr. Casaubon, who had the advantage probably of watching him and
18830: seeing that he dared not turn his head. Why had he not imagined this
18831: beforehand?—but he could not expect that he should sit in that square
18832: pew alone, unrelieved by any Tuckers, who had apparently departed from
18833: Lowick altogether, for a new clergyman was in the desk. Still he called
18834: himself stupid now for not foreseeing that it would be impossible for
18835: him to look towards Dorothea—nay, that she might feel his coming an
18836: impertinence. There was no delivering himself from his cage, however;
18837: and Will found his places and looked at his book as if he had been a
18838: school-mistress, feeling that the morning service had never been so
18839: immeasurably long before, that he was utterly ridiculous, out of
18840: temper, and miserable. This was what a man got by worshipping the sight
18841: of a woman! The clerk observed with surprise that Mr. Ladislaw did not
18842: join in the tune of Hanover, and reflected that he might have a cold.
18843: 
18844: Mr. Casaubon did not preach that morning, and there was no change in
18845: Will’s situation until the blessing had been pronounced and every one
18846: rose. It was the fashion at Lowick for “the betters” to go out first.
18847: With a sudden determination to break the spell that was upon him, Will
18848: looked straight at Mr. Casaubon. But that gentleman’s eyes were on the
18849: button of the pew-door, which he opened, allowing Dorothea to pass, and
18850: following her immediately without raising his eyelids. Will’s glance
18851: had caught Dorothea’s as she turned out of the pew, and again she
18852: bowed, but this time with a look of agitation, as if she were
18853: repressing tears. Will walked out after them, but they went on towards
18854: the little gate leading out of the churchyard into the shrubbery, never
18855: looking round.
18856: 
18857: It was impossible for him to follow them, and he could only walk back
18858: sadly at mid-day along the same road which he had trodden hopefully in
18859: the morning. The lights were all changed for him both without and
18860: within.
18861: 
18862: 
18863: 
18864: 
18865: CHAPTER XLVIII.
18866: 
18867: Surely the golden hours are turning gray
18868: And dance no more, and vainly strive to run:
18869: I see their white locks streaming in the wind—
18870: Each face is haggard as it looks at me,
18871: Slow turning in the constant clasping round
18872: Storm-driven.
18873: 
18874: 
18875: Dorothea’s distress when she was leaving the church came chiefly from
18876: the perception that Mr. Casaubon was determined not to speak to his
18877: cousin, and that Will’s presence at church had served to mark more
18878: strongly the alienation between them. Will’s coming seemed to her quite
18879: excusable, nay, she thought it an amiable movement in him towards a
18880: reconciliation which she herself had been constantly wishing for. He
18881: had probably imagined, as she had, that if Mr. Casaubon and he could
18882: meet easily, they would shake hands and friendly intercourse might
18883: return. But now Dorothea felt quite robbed of that hope. Will was
18884: banished further than ever, for Mr. Casaubon must have been newly
18885: embittered by this thrusting upon him of a presence which he refused to
18886: recognize.
18887: 
18888: He had not been very well that morning, suffering from some difficulty
18889: in breathing, and had not preached in consequence; she was not
18890: surprised, therefore, that he was nearly silent at luncheon, still less
18891: that he made no allusion to Will Ladislaw. For her own part she felt
18892: that she could never again introduce that subject. They usually spent
18893: apart the hours between luncheon and dinner on a Sunday; Mr. Casaubon
18894: in the library dozing chiefly, and Dorothea in her boudoir, where she
18895: was wont to occupy herself with some of her favorite books. There was a
18896: little heap of them on the table in the bow-window—of various sorts,
18897: from Herodotus, which she was learning to read with Mr. Casaubon, to
18898: her old companion Pascal, and Keble’s “Christian Year.” But to-day she
18899: opened one after another, and could read none of them. Everything
18900: seemed dreary: the portents before the birth of Cyrus—Jewish
18901: antiquities—oh dear!—devout epigrams—the sacred chime of favorite
18902: hymns—all alike were as flat as tunes beaten on wood: even the spring
18903: flowers and the grass had a dull shiver in them under the afternoon
18904: clouds that hid the sun fitfully; even the sustaining thoughts which
18905: had become habits seemed to have in them the weariness of long future
18906: days in which she would still live with them for her sole companions.
18907: It was another or rather a fuller sort of companionship that poor
18908: Dorothea was hungering for, and the hunger had grown from the perpetual
18909: effort demanded by her married life. She was always trying to be what
18910: her husband wished, and never able to repose on his delight in what she
18911: was. The thing that she liked, that she spontaneously cared to have,
18912: seemed to be always excluded from her life; for if it was only granted
18913: and not shared by her husband it might as well have been denied. About
18914: Will Ladislaw there had been a difference between them from the first,
18915: and it had ended, since Mr. Casaubon had so severely repulsed
18916: Dorothea’s strong feeling about his claims on the family property, by
18917: her being convinced that she was in the right and her husband in the
18918: wrong, but that she was helpless. This afternoon the helplessness was
18919: more wretchedly benumbing than ever: she longed for objects who could
18920: be dear to her, and to whom she could be dear. She longed for work
18921: which would be directly beneficent like the sunshine and the rain, and
18922: now it appeared that she was to live more and more in a virtual tomb,
18923: where there was the apparatus of a ghastly labor producing what would
18924: never see the light. Today she had stood at the door of the tomb and
18925: seen Will Ladislaw receding into the distant world of warm activity and
18926: fellowship—turning his face towards her as he went.
18927: 
18928: Books were of no use. Thinking was of no use. It was Sunday, and she
18929: could not have the carriage to go to Celia, who had lately had a baby.
18930: There was no refuge now from spiritual emptiness and discontent, and
18931: Dorothea had to bear her bad mood, as she would have borne a headache.
18932: 
18933: After dinner, at the hour when she usually began to read aloud, Mr.
18934: Casaubon proposed that they should go into the library, where, he said,
18935: he had ordered a fire and lights. He seemed to have revived, and to be
18936: thinking intently.
18937: 
18938: In the library Dorothea observed that he had newly arranged a row of
18939: his note-books on a table, and now he took up and put into her hand a
18940: well-known volume, which was a table of contents to all the others.
18941: 
18942: “You will oblige me, my dear,” he said, seating himself, “if instead of
18943: other reading this evening, you will go through this aloud, pencil in
18944: hand, and at each point where I say ‘mark,’ will make a cross with your
18945: pencil. This is the first step in a sifting process which I have long
18946: had in view, and as we go on I shall be able to indicate to you certain
18947: principles of selection whereby you will, I trust, have an intelligent
18948: participation in my purpose.”
18949: 
18950: This proposal was only one more sign added to many since his memorable
18951: interview with Lydgate, that Mr. Casaubon’s original reluctance to let
18952: Dorothea work with him had given place to the contrary disposition,
18953: namely, to demand much interest and labor from her.
18954: 
18955: After she had read and marked for two hours, he said, “We will take the
18956: volume up-stairs—and the pencil, if you please—and in case of reading
18957: in the night, we can pursue this task. It is not wearisome to you, I
18958: trust, Dorothea?”
18959: 
18960: “I prefer always reading what you like best to hear,” said Dorothea,
18961: who told the simple truth; for what she dreaded was to exert herself in
18962: reading or anything else which left him as joyless as ever.
18963: 
18964: It was a proof of the force with which certain characteristics in
18965: Dorothea impressed those around her, that her husband, with all his
18966: jealousy and suspicion, had gathered implicit trust in the integrity of
18967: her promises, and her power of devoting herself to her idea of the
18968: right and best. Of late he had begun to feel that these qualities were
18969: a peculiar possession for himself, and he wanted to engross them.
18970: 
18971: The reading in the night did come. Dorothea in her young weariness had
18972: slept soon and fast: she was awakened by a sense of light, which seemed
18973: to her at first like a sudden vision of sunset after she had climbed a
18974: steep hill: she opened her eyes and saw her husband wrapped in his warm
18975: gown seating himself in the arm-chair near the fire-place where the
18976: embers were still glowing. He had lit two candles, expecting that
18977: Dorothea would awake, but not liking to rouse her by more direct means.
18978: 
18979: “Are you ill, Edward?” she said, rising immediately.
18980: 
18981: “I felt some uneasiness in a reclining posture. I will sit here for a
18982: time.” She threw wood on the fire, wrapped herself up, and said, “You
18983: would like me to read to you?”
18984: 
18985: “You would oblige me greatly by doing so, Dorothea,” said Mr. Casaubon,
18986: with a shade more meekness than usual in his polite manner. “I am
18987: wakeful: my mind is remarkably lucid.”
18988: 
18989: “I fear that the excitement may be too great for you,” said Dorothea,
18990: remembering Lydgate’s cautions.
18991: 
18992: “No, I am not conscious of undue excitement. Thought is easy.” Dorothea
18993: dared not insist, and she read for an hour or more on the same plan as
18994: she had done in the evening, but getting over the pages with more
18995: quickness. Mr. Casaubon’s mind was more alert, and he seemed to
18996: anticipate what was coming after a very slight verbal indication,
18997: saying, “That will do—mark that”—or “Pass on to the next head—I omit
18998: the second excursus on Crete.” Dorothea was amazed to think of the
18999: bird-like speed with which his mind was surveying the ground where it
19000: had been creeping for years. At last he said—
19001: 
19002: “Close the book now, my dear. We will resume our work to-morrow. I have
19003: deferred it too long, and would gladly see it completed. But you
19004: observe that the principle on which my selection is made, is to give
19005: adequate, and not disproportionate illustration to each of the theses
19006: enumerated in my introduction, as at present sketched. You have
19007: perceived that distinctly, Dorothea?”
19008: 
19009: “Yes,” said Dorothea, rather tremulously. She felt sick at heart.
19010: 
19011: “And now I think that I can take some repose,” said Mr. Casaubon. He
19012: laid down again and begged her to put out the lights. When she had lain
19013: down too, and there was a darkness only broken by a dull glow on the
19014: hearth, he said—
19015: 
19016: “Before I sleep, I have a request to make, Dorothea.”
19017: 
19018: “What is it?” said Dorothea, with dread in her mind.
19019: 
19020: “It is that you will let me know, deliberately, whether, in case of my
19021: death, you will carry out my wishes: whether you will avoid doing what
19022: I should deprecate, and apply yourself to do what I should desire.”
19023: 
19024: Dorothea was not taken by surprise: many incidents had been leading her
19025: to the conjecture of some intention on her husband’s part which might
19026: make a new yoke for her. She did not answer immediately.
19027: 
19028: “You refuse?” said Mr. Casaubon, with more edge in his tone.
19029: 
19030: “No, I do not yet refuse,” said Dorothea, in a clear voice, the need of
19031: freedom asserting itself within her; “but it is too solemn—I think it
19032: is not right—to make a promise when I am ignorant what it will bind me
19033: to. Whatever affection prompted I would do without promising.”
19034: 
19035: “But you would use your own judgment: I ask you to obey mine; you
19036: refuse.”
19037: 
19038: “No, dear, no!” said Dorothea, beseechingly, crushed by opposing fears.
19039: “But may I wait and reflect a little while? I desire with my whole soul
19040: to do what will comfort you; but I cannot give any pledge
19041: suddenly—still less a pledge to do I know not what.”
19042: 
19043: “You cannot then confide in the nature of my wishes?”
19044: 
19045: “Grant me till to-morrow,” said Dorothea, beseechingly.
19046: 
19047: “Till to-morrow then,” said Mr. Casaubon.
19048: 
19049: Soon she could hear that he was sleeping, but there was no more sleep
19050: for her. While she constrained herself to lie still lest she should
19051: disturb him, her mind was carrying on a conflict in which imagination
19052: ranged its forces first on one side and then on the other. She had no
19053: presentiment that the power which her husband wished to establish over
19054: her future action had relation to anything else than his work. But it
19055: was clear enough to her that he would expect her to devote herself to
19056: sifting those mixed heaps of material, which were to be the doubtful
19057: illustration of principles still more doubtful. The poor child had
19058: become altogether unbelieving as to the trustworthiness of that Key
19059: which had made the ambition and the labor of her husband’s life. It was
19060: not wonderful that, in spite of her small instruction, her judgment in
19061: this matter was truer than his: for she looked with unbiassed
19062: comparison and healthy sense at probabilities on which he had risked
19063: all his egoism. And now she pictured to herself the days, and months,
19064: and years which she must spend in sorting what might be called
19065: shattered mummies, and fragments of a tradition which was itself a
19066: mosaic wrought from crushed ruins—sorting them as food for a theory
19067: which was already withered in the birth like an elfin child. Doubtless
19068: a vigorous error vigorously pursued has kept the embryos of truth
19069: a-breathing: the quest of gold being at the same time a questioning of
19070: substances, the body of chemistry is prepared for its soul, and
19071: Lavoisier is born. But Mr. Casaubon’s theory of the elements which made
19072: the seed of all tradition was not likely to bruise itself unawares
19073: against discoveries: it floated among flexible conjectures no more
19074: solid than those etymologies which seemed strong because of likeness in
19075: sound until it was shown that likeness in sound made them impossible:
19076: it was a method of interpretation which was not tested by the necessity
19077: of forming anything which had sharper collisions than an elaborate
19078: notion of Gog and Magog: it was as free from interruption as a plan for
19079: threading the stars together. And Dorothea had so often had to check
19080: her weariness and impatience over this questionable riddle-guessing, as
19081: it revealed itself to her instead of the fellowship in high knowledge
19082: which was to make life worthier! She could understand well enough now
19083: why her husband had come to cling to her, as possibly the only hope
19084: left that his labors would ever take a shape in which they could be
19085: given to the world. At first it had seemed that he wished to keep even
19086: her aloof from any close knowledge of what he was doing; but gradually
19087: the terrible stringency of human need—the prospect of a too speedy
19088: death—
19089: 
19090: And here Dorothea’s pity turned from her own future to her husband’s
19091: past—nay, to his present hard struggle with a lot which had grown out
19092: of that past: the lonely labor, the ambition breathing hardly under the
19093: pressure of self-distrust; the goal receding, and the heavier limbs;
19094: and now at last the sword visibly trembling above him! And had she not
19095: wished to marry him that she might help him in his life’s labor?—But
19096: she had thought the work was to be something greater, which she could
19097: serve in devoutly for its own sake. Was it right, even to soothe his
19098: grief—would it be possible, even if she promised—to work as in a
19099: treadmill fruitlessly?
19100: 
19101: And yet, could she deny him? Could she say, “I refuse to content this
19102: pining hunger?” It would be refusing to do for him dead, what she was
19103: almost sure to do for him living. If he lived as Lydgate had said he
19104: might, for fifteen years or more, her life would certainly be spent in
19105: helping him and obeying him.
19106: 
19107: Still, there was a deep difference between that devotion to the living
19108: and that indefinite promise of devotion to the dead. While he lived, he
19109: could claim nothing that she would not still be free to remonstrate
19110: against, and even to refuse. But—the thought passed through her mind
19111: more than once, though she could not believe in it—might he not mean to
19112: demand something more from her than she had been able to imagine, since
19113: he wanted her pledge to carry out his wishes without telling her
19114: exactly what they were? No; his heart was bound up in his work only:
19115: that was the end for which his failing life was to be eked out by hers.
19116: 
19117: And now, if she were to say, “No! if you die, I will put no finger to
19118: your work“—it seemed as if she would be crushing that bruised heart.
19119: 
19120: For four hours Dorothea lay in this conflict, till she felt ill and
19121: bewildered, unable to resolve, praying mutely. Helpless as a child
19122: which has sobbed and sought too long, she fell into a late morning
19123: sleep, and when she waked Mr. Casaubon was already up. Tantripp told
19124: her that he had read prayers, breakfasted, and was in the library.
19125: 
19126: “I never saw you look so pale, madam,” said Tantripp, a solid-figured
19127: woman who had been with the sisters at Lausanne.
19128: 
19129: “Was I ever high-colored, Tantripp?” said Dorothea, smiling faintly.
19130: 
19131: “Well, not to say high-colored, but with a bloom like a Chiny rose. But
19132: always smelling those leather books, what can be expected? Do rest a
19133: little this morning, madam. Let me say you are ill and not able to go
19134: into that close library.”
19135: 
19136: “Oh no, no! let me make haste,” said Dorothea. “Mr. Casaubon wants me
19137: particularly.”
19138: 
19139: When she went down she felt sure that she should promise to fulfil his
19140: wishes; but that would be later in the day—not yet.
19141: 
19142: As Dorothea entered the library, Mr. Casaubon turned round from the
19143: table where he had been placing some books, and said—
19144: 
19145: “I was waiting for your appearance, my dear. I had hoped to set to work
19146: at once this morning, but I find myself under some indisposition,
19147: probably from too much excitement yesterday. I am going now to take a
19148: turn in the shrubbery, since the air is milder.”
19149: 
19150: “I am glad to hear that,” said Dorothea. “Your mind, I feared, was too
19151: active last night.”
19152: 
19153: “I would fain have it set at rest on the point I last spoke of,
19154: Dorothea. You can now, I hope, give me an answer.”
19155: 
19156: “May I come out to you in the garden presently?” said Dorothea, winning
19157: a little breathing space in that way.
19158: 
19159: “I shall be in the Yew-tree Walk for the next half-hour,” said Mr.
19160: Casaubon, and then he left her.
19161: 
19162: Dorothea, feeling very weary, rang and asked Tantripp to bring her some
19163: wraps. She had been sitting still for a few minutes, but not in any
19164: renewal of the former conflict: she simply felt that she was going to
19165: say “Yes” to her own doom: she was too weak, too full of dread at the
19166: thought of inflicting a keen-edged blow on her husband, to do anything
19167: but submit completely. She sat still and let Tantripp put on her bonnet
19168: and shawl, a passivity which was unusual with her, for she liked to
19169: wait on herself.
19170: 
19171: “God bless you, madam!” said Tantripp, with an irrepressible movement
19172: of love towards the beautiful, gentle creature for whom she felt unable
19173: to do anything more, now that she had finished tying the bonnet.
19174: 
19175: This was too much for Dorothea’s highly-strung feeling, and she burst
19176: into tears, sobbing against Tantripp’s arm. But soon she checked
19177: herself, dried her eyes, and went out at the glass door into the
19178: shrubbery.
19179: 
19180: “I wish every book in that library was built into a caticom for your
19181: master,” said Tantripp to Pratt, the butler, finding him in the
19182: breakfast-room. She had been at Rome, and visited the antiquities, as
19183: we know; and she always declined to call Mr. Casaubon anything but
19184: “your master,” when speaking to the other servants.
19185: 
19186: Pratt laughed. He liked his master very well, but he liked Tantripp
19187: better.
19188: 
19189: When Dorothea was out on the gravel walks, she lingered among the
19190: nearer clumps of trees, hesitating, as she had done once before, though
19191: from a different cause. Then she had feared lest her effort at
19192: fellowship should be unwelcome; now she dreaded going to the spot where
19193: she foresaw that she must bind herself to a fellowship from which she
19194: shrank. Neither law nor the world’s opinion compelled her to this—only
19195: her husband’s nature and her own compassion, only the ideal and not the
19196: real yoke of marriage. She saw clearly enough the whole situation, yet
19197: she was fettered: she could not smite the stricken soul that entreated
19198: hers. If that were weakness, Dorothea was weak. But the half-hour was
19199: passing, and she must not delay longer. When she entered the Yew-tree
19200: Walk she could not see her husband; but the walk had bends, and she
19201: went, expecting to catch sight of his figure wrapped in a blue cloak,
19202: which, with a warm velvet cap, was his outer garment on chill days for
19203: the garden. It occurred to her that he might be resting in the
19204: summer-house, towards which the path diverged a little. Turning the
19205: angle, she could see him seated on the bench, close to a stone table.
19206: His arms were resting on the table, and his brow was bowed down on
19207: them, the blue cloak being dragged forward and screening his face on
19208: each side.
19209: 
19210: “He exhausted himself last night,” Dorothea said to herself, thinking
19211: at first that he was asleep, and that the summer-house was too damp a
19212: place to rest in. But then she remembered that of late she had seen him
19213: take that attitude when she was reading to him, as if he found it
19214: easier than any other; and that he would sometimes speak, as well as
19215: listen, with his face down in that way. She went into the summerhouse
19216: and said, “I am come, Edward; I am ready.”
19217: 
19218: He took no notice, and she thought that he must be fast asleep. She
19219: laid her hand on his shoulder, and repeated, “I am ready!” Still he was
19220: motionless; and with a sudden confused fear, she leaned down to him,
19221: took off his velvet cap, and leaned her cheek close to his head, crying
19222: in a distressed tone—
19223: 
19224: “Wake, dear, wake! Listen to me. I am come to answer.” But Dorothea
19225: never gave her answer.
19226: 
19227: Later in the day, Lydgate was seated by her bedside, and she was
19228: talking deliriously, thinking aloud, and recalling what had gone
19229: through her mind the night before. She knew him, and called him by his
19230: name, but appeared to think it right that she should explain everything
19231: to him; and again, and again, begged him to explain everything to her
19232: husband.
19233: 
19234: “Tell him I shall go to him soon: I am ready to promise. Only, thinking
19235: about it was so dreadful—it has made me ill. Not very ill. I shall soon
19236: be better. Go and tell him.”
19237: 
19238: But the silence in her husband’s ear was never more to be broken.
19239: 
19240: 
19241: 
19242: 
19243: CHAPTER XLIX.
19244: 
19245: “A task too strong for wizard spells
19246: This squire had brought about;
19247: ’T is easy dropping stones in wells,
19248: But who shall get them out?”
19249: 
19250: 
19251: “I wish to God we could hinder Dorothea from knowing this,” said Sir
19252: James Chettam, with a little frown on his brow, and an expression of
19253: intense disgust about his mouth.
19254: 
19255: He was standing on the hearth-rug in the library at Lowick Grange, and
19256: speaking to Mr. Brooke. It was the day after Mr. Casaubon had been
19257: buried, and Dorothea was not yet able to leave her room.
19258: 
19259: “That would be difficult, you know, Chettam, as she is an executrix,
19260: and she likes to go into these things—property, land, that kind of
19261: thing. She has her notions, you know,” said Mr. Brooke, sticking his
19262: eye-glasses on nervously, and exploring the edges of a folded paper
19263: which he held in his hand; “and she would like to act—depend upon it,
19264: as an executrix Dorothea would want to act. And she was twenty-one last
19265: December, you know. I can hinder nothing.”
19266: 
19267: Sir James looked at the carpet for a minute in silence, and then
19268: lifting his eyes suddenly fixed them on Mr. Brooke, saying, “I will
19269: tell you what we can do. Until Dorothea is well, all business must be
19270: kept from her, and as soon as she is able to be moved she must come to
19271: us. Being with Celia and the baby will be the best thing in the world
19272: for her, and will pass away the time. And meanwhile you must get rid of
19273: Ladislaw: you must send him out of the country.” Here Sir James’s look
19274: of disgust returned in all its intensity.
19275: 
19276: Mr. Brooke put his hands behind him, walked to the window and
19277: straightened his back with a little shake before he replied.
19278: 
19279: “That is easily said, Chettam, easily said, you know.”
19280: 
19281: “My dear sir,” persisted Sir James, restraining his indignation within
19282: respectful forms, “it was you who brought him here, and you who keep
19283: him here—I mean by the occupation you give him.”
19284: 
19285: “Yes, but I can’t dismiss him in an instant without assigning reasons,
19286: my dear Chettam. Ladislaw has been invaluable, most satisfactory. I
19287: consider that I have done this part of the country a service by
19288: bringing him—by bringing him, you know.” Mr. Brooke ended with a nod,
19289: turning round to give it.
19290: 
19291: “It’s a pity this part of the country didn’t do without him, that’s all
19292: I have to say about it. At any rate, as Dorothea’s brother-in-law, I
19293: feel warranted in objecting strongly to his being kept here by any
19294: action on the part of her friends. You admit, I hope, that I have a
19295: right to speak about what concerns the dignity of my wife’s sister?”
19296: 
19297: Sir James was getting warm.
19298: 
19299: “Of course, my dear Chettam, of course. But you and I have different
19300: ideas—different—”
19301: 
19302: “Not about this action of Casaubon’s, I should hope,” interrupted Sir
19303: James. “I say that he has most unfairly compromised Dorothea. I say
19304: that there never was a meaner, more ungentlemanly action than this—a
19305: codicil of this sort to a will which he made at the time of his
19306: marriage with the knowledge and reliance of her family—a positive
19307: insult to Dorothea!”
19308: 
19309: “Well, you know, Casaubon was a little twisted about Ladislaw. Ladislaw
19310: has told me the reason—dislike of the bent he took, you know—Ladislaw
19311: didn’t think much of Casaubon’s notions, Thoth and Dagon—that sort of
19312: thing: and I fancy that Casaubon didn’t like the independent position
19313: Ladislaw had taken up. I saw the letters between them, you know. Poor
19314: Casaubon was a little buried in books—he didn’t know the world.”
19315: 
19316: “It’s all very well for Ladislaw to put that color on it,” said Sir
19317: James. “But I believe Casaubon was only jealous of him on Dorothea’s
19318: account, and the world will suppose that she gave him some reason; and
19319: that is what makes it so abominable—coupling her name with this young
19320: fellow’s.”
19321: 
19322: “My dear Chettam, it won’t lead to anything, you know,” said Mr.
19323: Brooke, seating himself and sticking on his eye-glass again. “It’s all
19324: of a piece with Casaubon’s oddity. This paper, now, ‘Synoptical
19325: Tabulation’ and so on, ‘for the use of Mrs. Casaubon,’ it was locked up
19326: in the desk with the will. I suppose he meant Dorothea to publish his
19327: researches, eh? and she’ll do it, you know; she has gone into his
19328: studies uncommonly.”
19329: 
19330: “My dear sir,” said Sir James, impatiently, “that is neither here nor
19331: there. The question is, whether you don’t see with me the propriety of
19332: sending young Ladislaw away?”
19333: 
19334: “Well, no, not the urgency of the thing. By-and-by, perhaps, it may
19335: come round. As to gossip, you know, sending him away won’t hinder
19336: gossip. People say what they like to say, not what they have chapter
19337: and verse for,” said Mr Brooke, becoming acute about the truths that
19338: lay on the side of his own wishes. “I might get rid of Ladislaw up to a
19339: certain point—take away the ‘Pioneer’ from him, and that sort of thing;
19340: but I couldn’t send him out of the country if he didn’t choose to
19341: go—didn’t choose, you know.”
19342: 
19343: Mr. Brooke, persisting as quietly as if he were only discussing the
19344: nature of last year’s weather, and nodding at the end with his usual
19345: amenity, was an exasperating form of obstinacy.
19346: 
19347: “Good God!” said Sir James, with as much passion as he ever showed,
19348: “let us get him a post; let us spend money on him. If he could go in
19349: the suite of some Colonial Governor! Grampus might take him—and I could
19350: write to Fulke about it.”
19351: 
19352: “But Ladislaw won’t be shipped off like a head of cattle, my dear
19353: fellow; Ladislaw has his ideas. It’s my opinion that if he were to part
19354: from me to-morrow, you’d only hear the more of him in the country. With
19355: his talent for speaking and drawing up documents, there are few men who
19356: could come up to him as an agitator—an agitator, you know.”
19357: 
19358: “Agitator!” said Sir James, with bitter emphasis, feeling that the
19359: syllables of this word properly repeated were a sufficient exposure of
19360: its hatefulness.
19361: 
19362: “But be reasonable, Chettam. Dorothea, now. As you say, she had better
19363: go to Celia as soon as possible. She can stay under your roof, and in
19364: the mean time things may come round quietly. Don’t let us be firing off
19365: our guns in a hurry, you know. Standish will keep our counsel, and the
19366: news will be old before it’s known. Twenty things may happen to carry
19367: off Ladislaw—without my doing anything, you know.”
19368: 
19369: “Then I am to conclude that you decline to do anything?”
19370: 
19371: “Decline, Chettam?—no—I didn’t say decline. But I really don’t see what
19372: I could do. Ladislaw is a gentleman.”
19373: 
19374: “I am glad to hear it!” said Sir James, his irritation making him
19375: forget himself a little. “I am sure Casaubon was not.”
19376: 
19377: “Well, it would have been worse if he had made the codicil to hinder
19378: her from marrying again at all, you know.”
19379: 
19380: “I don’t know that,” said Sir James. “It would have been less
19381: indelicate.”
19382: 
19383: “One of poor Casaubon’s freaks! That attack upset his brain a little.
19384: It all goes for nothing. She doesn’t _want_ to marry Ladislaw.”
19385: 
19386: “But this codicil is framed so as to make everybody believe that she
19387: did. I don’t believe anything of the sort about Dorothea,” said Sir
19388: James—then frowningly, “but I suspect Ladislaw. I tell you frankly, I
19389: suspect Ladislaw.”
19390: 
19391: “I couldn’t take any immediate action on that ground, Chettam. In fact,
19392: if it were possible to pack him off—send him to Norfolk Island—that
19393: sort of thing—it would look all the worse for Dorothea to those who
19394: knew about it. It would seem as if we distrusted her—distrusted her,
19395: you know.”
19396: 
19397: That Mr. Brooke had hit on an undeniable argument, did not tend to
19398: soothe Sir James. He put out his hand to reach his hat, implying that
19399: he did not mean to contend further, and said, still with some heat—
19400: 
19401: “Well, I can only say that I think Dorothea was sacrificed once,
19402: because her friends were too careless. I shall do what I can, as her
19403: brother, to protect her now.”
19404: 
19405: “You can’t do better than get her to Freshitt as soon as possible,
19406: Chettam. I approve that plan altogether,” said Mr. Brooke, well pleased
19407: that he had won the argument. It would have been highly inconvenient to
19408: him to part with Ladislaw at that time, when a dissolution might happen
19409: any day, and electors were to be convinced of the course by which the
19410: interests of the country would be best served. Mr. Brooke sincerely
19411: believed that this end could be secured by his own return to
19412: Parliament: he offered the forces of his mind honestly to the nation.
19413: 
19414: 
19415: 
19416: 
19417: CHAPTER L.
19418: 
19419: “This Loller here wol precilen us somewhat.”
19420: “Nay by my father’s soule! that schal he nat,”
19421: Sayde the Schipman, ‘here schal he not preche,
19422: We schal no gospel glosen here ne teche.
19423: We leven all in the gret God,’ quod he.
19424: He wolden sowen some diffcultee.”—_Canterbury Tales_.
19425: 
19426: 
19427: Dorothea had been safe at Freshitt Hall nearly a week before she had
19428: asked any dangerous questions. Every morning now she sat with Celia in
19429: the prettiest of up-stairs sitting-rooms, opening into a small
19430: conservatory—Celia all in white and lavender like a bunch of mixed
19431: violets, watching the remarkable acts of the baby, which were so
19432: dubious to her inexperienced mind that all conversation was interrupted
19433: by appeals for their interpretation made to the oracular nurse.
19434: Dorothea sat by in her widow’s dress, with an expression which rather
19435: provoked Celia, as being much too sad; for not only was baby quite
19436: well, but really when a husband had been so dull and troublesome while
19437: he lived, and besides that had—well, well! Sir James, of course, had
19438: told Celia everything, with a strong representation how important it
19439: was that Dorothea should not know it sooner than was inevitable.
19440: 
19441: But Mr. Brooke had been right in predicting that Dorothea would not
19442: long remain passive where action had been assigned to her; she knew the
19443: purport of her husband’s will made at the time of their marriage, and
19444: her mind, as soon as she was clearly conscious of her position, was
19445: silently occupied with what she ought to do as the owner of Lowick
19446: Manor with the patronage of the living attached to it.
19447: 
19448: One morning when her uncle paid his usual visit, though with an unusual
19449: alacrity in his manner which he accounted for by saying that it was now
19450: pretty certain Parliament would be dissolved forthwith, Dorothea said—
19451: 
19452: “Uncle, it is right now that I should consider who is to have the
19453: living at Lowick. After Mr. Tucker had been provided for, I never heard
19454: my husband say that he had any clergyman in his mind as a successor to
19455: himself. I think I ought to have the keys now and go to Lowick to
19456: examine all my husband’s papers. There may be something that would
19457: throw light on his wishes.”
19458: 
19459: “No hurry, my dear,” said Mr. Brooke, quietly. “By-and-by, you know,
19460: you can go, if you like. But I cast my eyes over things in the desks
19461: and drawers—there was nothing—nothing but deep subjects, you
19462: know—besides the will. Everything can be done by-and-by. As to the
19463: living, I have had an application for interest already—I should say
19464: rather good. Mr. Tyke has been strongly recommended to me—I had
19465: something to do with getting him an appointment before. An apostolic
19466: man, I believe—the sort of thing that would suit you, my dear.”
19467: 
19468: “I should like to have fuller knowledge about him, uncle, and judge for
19469: myself, if Mr. Casaubon has not left any expression of his wishes. He
19470: has perhaps made some addition to his will—there may be some
19471: instructions for me,” said Dorothea, who had all the while had this
19472: conjecture in her mind with relation to her husband’s work.
19473: 
19474: “Nothing about the rectory, my dear—nothing,” said Mr. Brooke, rising
19475: to go away, and putting out his hand to his nieces: “nor about his
19476: researches, you know. Nothing in the will.”
19477: 
19478: Dorothea’s lip quivered.
19479: 
19480: “Come, you must not think of these things yet, my dear. By-and-by, you
19481: know.”
19482: 
19483: “I am quite well now, uncle; I wish to exert myself.”
19484: 
19485: “Well, well, we shall see. But I must run away now—I have no end of
19486: work now—it’s a crisis—a political crisis, you know. And here is Celia
19487: and her little man—you are an aunt, you know, now, and I am a sort of
19488: grandfather,” said Mr. Brooke, with placid hurry, anxious to get away
19489: and tell Chettam that it would not be his (Mr. Brooke’s) fault if
19490: Dorothea insisted on looking into everything.
19491: 
19492: Dorothea sank back in her chair when her uncle had left the room, and
19493: cast her eyes down meditatively on her crossed hands.
19494: 
19495: “Look, Dodo! look at him! Did you ever see anything like that?” said
19496: Celia, in her comfortable staccato.
19497: 
19498: “What, Kitty?” said Dorothea, lifting her eyes rather absently.
19499: 
19500: “What? why, his upper lip; see how he is drawing it down, as if he
19501: meant to make a face. Isn’t it wonderful! He may have his little
19502: thoughts. I wish nurse were here. Do look at him.”
19503: 
19504: A large tear which had been for some time gathering, rolled down
19505: Dorothea’s cheek as she looked up and tried to smile.
19506: 
19507: “Don’t be sad, Dodo; kiss baby. What are you brooding over so? I am
19508: sure you did everything, and a great deal too much. You should be happy
19509: now.”
19510: 
19511: “I wonder if Sir James would drive me to Lowick. I want to look over
19512: everything—to see if there were any words written for me.”
19513: 
19514: “You are not to go till Mr. Lydgate says you may go. And he has not
19515: said so yet (here you are, nurse; take baby and walk up and down the
19516: gallery). Besides, you have got a wrong notion in your head as usual,
19517: Dodo—I can see that: it vexes me.”
19518: 
19519: “Where am I wrong, Kitty?” said Dorothea, quite meekly. She was almost
19520: ready now to think Celia wiser than herself, and was really wondering
19521: with some fear what her wrong notion was. Celia felt her advantage, and
19522: was determined to use it. None of them knew Dodo as well as she did, or
19523: knew how to manage her. Since Celia’s baby was born, she had had a new
19524: sense of her mental solidity and calm wisdom. It seemed clear that
19525: where there was a baby, things were right enough, and that error, in
19526: general, was a mere lack of that central poising force.
19527: 
19528: “I can see what you are thinking of as well as can be, Dodo,” said
19529: Celia. “You are wanting to find out if there is anything uncomfortable
19530: for you to do now, only because Mr. Casaubon wished it. As if you had
19531: not been uncomfortable enough before. And he doesn’t deserve it, and
19532: you will find that out. He has behaved very badly. James is as angry
19533: with him as can be. And I had better tell you, to prepare you.”
19534: 
19535: “Celia,” said Dorothea, entreatingly, “you distress me. Tell me at once
19536: what you mean.” It glanced through her mind that Mr. Casaubon had left
19537: the property away from her—which would not be so very distressing.
19538: 
19539: “Why, he has made a codicil to his will, to say the property was all to
19540: go away from you if you married—I mean—”
19541: 
19542: “That is of no consequence,” said Dorothea, breaking in impetuously.
19543: 
19544: “But if you married Mr. Ladislaw, not anybody else,” Celia went on with
19545: persevering quietude. “Of course that is of no consequence in one
19546: way—you never _would_ marry Mr. Ladislaw; but that only makes it worse
19547: of Mr. Casaubon.”
19548: 
19549: The blood rushed to Dorothea’s face and neck painfully. But Celia was
19550: administering what she thought a sobering dose of fact. It was taking
19551: up notions that had done Dodo’s health so much harm. So she went on in
19552: her neutral tone, as if she had been remarking on baby’s robes.
19553: 
19554: “James says so. He says it is abominable, and not like a gentleman. And
19555: there never was a better judge than James. It is as if Mr. Casaubon
19556: wanted to make people believe that you would wish to marry Mr.
19557: Ladislaw—which is ridiculous. Only James says it was to hinder Mr.
19558: Ladislaw from wanting to marry you for your money—just as if he ever
19559: would think of making you an offer. Mrs. Cadwallader said you might as
19560: well marry an Italian with white mice! But I must just go and look at
19561: baby,” Celia added, without the least change of tone, throwing a light
19562: shawl over her, and tripping away.
19563: 
19564: Dorothea by this time had turned cold again, and now threw herself back
19565: helplessly in her chair. She might have compared her experience at that
19566: moment to the vague, alarmed consciousness that her life was taking on
19567: a new form, that she was undergoing a metamorphosis in which memory
19568: would not adjust itself to the stirring of new organs. Everything was
19569: changing its aspect: her husband’s conduct, her own duteous feeling
19570: towards him, every struggle between them—and yet more, her whole
19571: relation to Will Ladislaw. Her world was in a state of convulsive
19572: change; the only thing she could say distinctly to herself was, that
19573: she must wait and think anew. One change terrified her as if it had
19574: been a sin; it was a violent shock of repulsion from her departed
19575: husband, who had had hidden thoughts, perhaps perverting everything she
19576: said and did. Then again she was conscious of another change which also
19577: made her tremulous; it was a sudden strange yearning of heart towards
19578: Will Ladislaw. It had never before entered her mind that he could,
19579: under any circumstances, be her lover: conceive the effect of the
19580: sudden revelation that another had thought of him in that light—that
19581: perhaps he himself had been conscious of such a possibility,—and this
19582: with the hurrying, crowding vision of unfitting conditions, and
19583: questions not soon to be solved.
19584: 
19585: It seemed a long while—she did not know how long—before she heard Celia
19586: saying, “That will do, nurse; he will be quiet on my lap now. You can
19587: go to lunch, and let Garratt stay in the next room. What I think,
19588: Dodo,” Celia went on, observing nothing more than that Dorothea was
19589: leaning back in her chair, and likely to be passive, “is that Mr.
19590: Casaubon was spiteful. I never did like him, and James never did. I
19591: think the corners of his mouth were dreadfully spiteful. And now he has
19592: behaved in this way, I am sure religion does not require you to make
19593: yourself uncomfortable about him. If he has been taken away, that is a
19594: mercy, and you ought to be grateful. We should not grieve, should we,
19595: baby?” said Celia confidentially to that unconscious centre and poise
19596: of the world, who had the most remarkable fists all complete even to
19597: the nails, and hair enough, really, when you took his cap off, to
19598: make—you didn’t know what:—in short, he was Bouddha in a Western form.
19599: 
19600: At this crisis Lydgate was announced, and one of the first things he
19601: said was, “I fear you are not so well as you were, Mrs. Casaubon; have
19602: you been agitated? allow me to feel your pulse.” Dorothea’s hand was of
19603: a marble coldness.
19604: 
19605: “She wants to go to Lowick, to look over papers,” said Celia. “She
19606: ought not, ought she?”
19607: 
19608: Lydgate did not speak for a few moments. Then he said, looking at
19609: Dorothea. “I hardly know. In my opinion Mrs. Casaubon should do what
19610: would give her the most repose of mind. That repose will not always
19611: come from being forbidden to act.”
19612: 
19613: “Thank you,” said Dorothea, exerting herself, “I am sure that is wise.
19614: There are so many things which I ought to attend to. Why should I sit
19615: here idle?” Then, with an effort to recall subjects not connected with
19616: her agitation, she added, abruptly, “You know every one in Middlemarch,
19617: I think, Mr. Lydgate. I shall ask you to tell me a great deal. I have
19618: serious things to do now. I have a living to give away. You know Mr.
19619: Tyke and all the—” But Dorothea’s effort was too much for her; she
19620: broke off and burst into sobs.
19621: 
19622: Lydgate made her drink a dose of sal volatile.
19623: 
19624: “Let Mrs. Casaubon do as she likes,” he said to Sir James, whom he
19625: asked to see before quitting the house. “She wants perfect freedom, I
19626: think, more than any other prescription.”
19627: 
19628: His attendance on Dorothea while her brain was excited, had enabled him
19629: to form some true conclusions concerning the trials of her life. He
19630: felt sure that she had been suffering from the strain and conflict of
19631: self-repression; and that she was likely now to feel herself only in
19632: another sort of pinfold than that from which she had been released.
19633: 
19634: Lydgate’s advice was all the easier for Sir James to follow when he
19635: found that Celia had already told Dorothea the unpleasant fact about
19636: the will. There was no help for it now—no reason for any further delay
19637: in the execution of necessary business. And the next day Sir James
19638: complied at once with her request that he would drive her to Lowick.
19639: 
19640: “I have no wish to stay there at present,” said Dorothea; “I could
19641: hardly bear it. I am much happier at Freshitt with Celia. I shall be
19642: able to think better about what should be done at Lowick by looking at
19643: it from a distance. And I should like to be at the Grange a little
19644: while with my uncle, and go about in all the old walks and among the
19645: people in the village.”
19646: 
19647: “Not yet, I think. Your uncle is having political company, and you are
19648: better out of the way of such doings,” said Sir James, who at that
19649: moment thought of the Grange chiefly as a haunt of young Ladislaw’s.
19650: But no word passed between him and Dorothea about the objectionable
19651: part of the will; indeed, both of them felt that the mention of it
19652: between them would be impossible. Sir James was shy, even with men,
19653: about disagreeable subjects; and the one thing that Dorothea would have
19654: chosen to say, if she had spoken on the matter at all, was forbidden to
19655: her at present because it seemed to be a further exposure of her
19656: husband’s injustice. Yet she did wish that Sir James could know what
19657: had passed between her and her husband about Will Ladislaw’s moral
19658: claim on the property: it would then, she thought, be apparent to him
19659: as it was to her, that her husband’s strange indelicate proviso had
19660: been chiefly urged by his bitter resistance to that idea of claim, and
19661: not merely by personal feelings more difficult to talk about. Also, it
19662: must be admitted, Dorothea wished that this could be known for Will’s
19663: sake, since her friends seemed to think of him as simply an object of
19664: Mr. Casaubon’s charity. Why should he be compared with an Italian
19665: carrying white mice? That word quoted from Mrs. Cadwallader seemed like
19666: a mocking travesty wrought in the dark by an impish finger.
19667: 
19668: At Lowick Dorothea searched desk and drawer—searched all her husband’s
19669: places of deposit for private writing, but found no paper addressed
19670: especially to her, except that “Synoptical Tabulation,” which was
19671: probably only the beginning of many intended directions for her
19672: guidance. In carrying out this bequest of labor to Dorothea, as in all
19673: else, Mr. Casaubon had been slow and hesitating, oppressed in the plan
19674: of transmitting his work, as he had been in executing it, by the sense
19675: of moving heavily in a dim and clogging medium: distrust of Dorothea’s
19676: competence to arrange what he had prepared was subdued only by distrust
19677: of any other redactor. But he had come at last to create a trust for
19678: himself out of Dorothea’s nature: she could do what she resolved to do:
19679: and he willingly imagined her toiling under the fetters of a promise to
19680: erect a tomb with his name upon it. (Not that Mr. Casaubon called the
19681: future volumes a tomb; he called them the Key to all Mythologies.) But
19682: the months gained on him and left his plans belated: he had only had
19683: time to ask for that promise by which he sought to keep his cold grasp
19684: on Dorothea’s life.
19685: 
19686: The grasp had slipped away. Bound by a pledge given from the depths of
19687: her pity, she would have been capable of undertaking a toil which her
19688: judgment whispered was vain for all uses except that consecration of
19689: faithfulness which is a supreme use. But now her judgment, instead of
19690: being controlled by duteous devotion, was made active by the
19691: imbittering discovery that in her past union there had lurked the
19692: hidden alienation of secrecy and suspicion. The living, suffering man
19693: was no longer before her to awaken her pity: there remained only the
19694: retrospect of painful subjection to a husband whose thoughts had been
19695: lower than she had believed, whose exorbitant claims for himself had
19696: even blinded his scrupulous care for his own character, and made him
19697: defeat his own pride by shocking men of ordinary honor. As for the
19698: property which was the sign of that broken tie, she would have been
19699: glad to be free from it and have nothing more than her original fortune
19700: which had been settled on her, if there had not been duties attached to
19701: ownership, which she ought not to flinch from. About this property many
19702: troublous questions insisted on rising: had she not been right in
19703: thinking that the half of it ought to go to Will Ladislaw?—but was it
19704: not impossible now for her to do that act of justice? Mr. Casaubon had
19705: taken a cruelly effective means of hindering her: even with indignation
19706: against him in her heart, any act that seemed a triumphant eluding of
19707: his purpose revolted her.
19708: 
19709: After collecting papers of business which she wished to examine, she
19710: locked up again the desks and drawers—all empty of personal words for
19711: her—empty of any sign that in her husband’s lonely brooding his heart
19712: had gone out to her in excuse or explanation; and she went back to
19713: Freshitt with the sense that around his last hard demand and his last
19714: injurious assertion of his power, the silence was unbroken.
19715: 
19716: Dorothea tried now to turn her thoughts towards immediate duties, and
19717: one of these was of a kind which others were determined to remind her
19718: of. Lydgate’s ear had caught eagerly her mention of the living, and as
19719: soon as he could, he reopened the subject, seeing here a possibility of
19720: making amends for the casting-vote he had once given with an
19721: ill-satisfied conscience. “Instead of telling you anything about Mr.
19722: Tyke,” he said, “I should like to speak of another man—Mr. Farebrother,
19723: the Vicar of St. Botolph’s. His living is a poor one, and gives him a
19724: stinted provision for himself and his family. His mother, aunt, and
19725: sister all live with him, and depend upon him. I believe he has never
19726: married because of them. I never heard such good preaching as his—such
19727: plain, easy eloquence. He would have done to preach at St. Paul’s Cross
19728: after old Latimer. His talk is just as good about all subjects:
19729: original, simple, clear. I think him a remarkable fellow: he ought to
19730: have done more than he has done.”
19731: 
19732: “Why has he not done more?” said Dorothea, interested now in all who
19733: had slipped below their own intention.
19734: 
19735: “That’s a hard question,” said Lydgate. “I find myself that it’s
19736: uncommonly difficult to make the right thing work: there are so many
19737: strings pulling at once. Farebrother often hints that he has got into
19738: the wrong profession; he wants a wider range than that of a poor
19739: clergyman, and I suppose he has no interest to help him on. He is very
19740: fond of Natural History and various scientific matters, and he is
19741: hampered in reconciling these tastes with his position. He has no money
19742: to spare—hardly enough to use; and that has led him into
19743: card-playing—Middlemarch is a great place for whist. He does play for
19744: money, and he wins a good deal. Of course that takes him into company a
19745: little beneath him, and makes him slack about some things; and yet,
19746: with all that, looking at him as a whole, I think he is one of the most
19747: blameless men I ever knew. He has neither venom nor doubleness in him,
19748: and those often go with a more correct outside.”
19749: 
19750: “I wonder whether he suffers in his conscience because of that habit,”
19751: said Dorothea; “I wonder whether he wishes he could leave it off.”
19752: 
19753: “I have no doubt he would leave it off, if he were transplanted into
19754: plenty: he would be glad of the time for other things.”
19755: 
19756: “My uncle says that Mr. Tyke is spoken of as an apostolic man,” said
19757: Dorothea, meditatively. She was wishing it were possible to restore the
19758: times of primitive zeal, and yet thinking of Mr. Farebrother with a
19759: strong desire to rescue him from his chance-gotten money.
19760: 
19761: “I don’t pretend to say that Farebrother is apostolic,” said Lydgate.
19762: “His position is not quite like that of the Apostles: he is only a
19763: parson among parishioners whose lives he has to try and make better.
19764: Practically I find that what is called being apostolic now, is an
19765: impatience of everything in which the parson doesn’t cut the principal
19766: figure. I see something of that in Mr. Tyke at the Hospital: a good
19767: deal of his doctrine is a sort of pinching hard to make people
19768: uncomfortably aware of him. Besides, an apostolic man at Lowick!—he
19769: ought to think, as St. Francis did, that it is needful to preach to the
19770: birds.”
19771: 
19772: “True,” said Dorothea. “It is hard to imagine what sort of notions our
19773: farmers and laborers get from their teaching. I have been looking into
19774: a volume of sermons by Mr. Tyke: such sermons would be of no use at
19775: Lowick—I mean, about imputed righteousness and the prophecies in the
19776: Apocalypse. I have always been thinking of the different ways in which
19777: Christianity is taught, and whenever I find one way that makes it a
19778: wider blessing than any other, I cling to that as the truest—I mean
19779: that which takes in the most good of all kinds, and brings in the most
19780: people as sharers in it. It is surely better to pardon too much, than
19781: to condemn too much. But I should like to see Mr. Farebrother and hear
19782: him preach.”
19783: 
19784: “Do,” said Lydgate; “I trust to the effect of that. He is very much
19785: beloved, but he has his enemies too: there are always people who can’t
19786: forgive an able man for differing from them. And that money-winning
19787: business is really a blot. You don’t, of course, see many Middlemarch
19788: people: but Mr. Ladislaw, who is constantly seeing Mr. Brooke, is a
19789: great friend of Mr. Farebrother’s old ladies, and would be glad to sing
19790: the Vicar’s praises. One of the old ladies—Miss Noble, the aunt—is a
19791: wonderfully quaint picture of self-forgetful goodness, and Ladislaw
19792: gallants her about sometimes. I met them one day in a back street: you
19793: know Ladislaw’s look—a sort of Daphnis in coat and waistcoat; and this
19794: little old maid reaching up to his arm—they looked like a couple
19795: dropped out of a romantic comedy. But the best evidence about
19796: Farebrother is to see him and hear him.”
19797: 
19798: Happily Dorothea was in her private sitting-room when this conversation
19799: occurred, and there was no one present to make Lydgate’s innocent
19800: introduction of Ladislaw painful to her. As was usual with him in
19801: matters of personal gossip, Lydgate had quite forgotten Rosamond’s
19802: remark that she thought Will adored Mrs. Casaubon. At that moment he
19803: was only caring for what would recommend the Farebrother family; and he
19804: had purposely given emphasis to the worst that could be said about the
19805: Vicar, in order to forestall objections. In the weeks since Mr.
19806: Casaubon’s death he had hardly seen Ladislaw, and he had heard no rumor
19807: to warn him that Mr. Brooke’s confidential secretary was a dangerous
19808: subject with Mrs. Casaubon. When he was gone, his picture of Ladislaw
19809: lingered in her mind and disputed the ground with that question of the
19810: Lowick living. What was Will Ladislaw thinking about her? Would he hear
19811: of that fact which made her cheeks burn as they never used to do? And
19812: how would he feel when he heard it?—But she could see as well as
19813: possible how he smiled down at the little old maid. An Italian with
19814: white mice!—on the contrary, he was a creature who entered into every
19815: one’s feelings, and could take the pressure of their thought instead of
19816: urging his own with iron resistance.
19817: 
19818: 
19819: 
19820: 
19821: CHAPTER LI.
19822: 
19823: Party is Nature too, and you shall see
19824: By force of Logic how they both agree:
19825: The Many in the One, the One in Many;
19826: All is not Some, nor Some the same as Any:
19827: Genus holds species, both are great or small;
19828: One genus highest, one not high at all;
19829: Each species has its differentia too,
19830: This is not That, and He was never You,
19831: Though this and that are AYES, and you and he
19832: Are like as one to one, or three to three.
19833: 
19834: 
19835: No gossip about Mr. Casaubon’s will had yet reached Ladislaw: the air
19836: seemed to be filled with the dissolution of Parliament and the coming
19837: election, as the old wakes and fairs were filled with the rival clatter
19838: of itinerant shows; and more private noises were taken little notice
19839: of. The famous “dry election” was at hand, in which the depths of
19840: public feeling might be measured by the low flood-mark of drink. Will
19841: Ladislaw was one of the busiest at this time; and though Dorothea’s
19842: widowhood was continually in his thought, he was so far from wishing to
19843: be spoken to on the subject, that when Lydgate sought him out to tell
19844: him what had passed about the Lowick living, he answered rather
19845: waspishly—
19846: 
19847: “Why should you bring me into the matter? I never see Mrs. Casaubon,
19848: and am not likely to see her, since she is at Freshitt. I never go
19849: there. It is Tory ground, where I and the ‘Pioneer’ are no more welcome
19850: than a poacher and his gun.”
19851: 
19852: The fact was that Will had been made the more susceptible by observing
19853: that Mr. Brooke, instead of wishing him, as before, to come to the
19854: Grange oftener than was quite agreeable to himself, seemed now to
19855: contrive that he should go there as little as possible. This was a
19856: shuffling concession of Mr. Brooke’s to Sir James Chettam’s indignant
19857: remonstrance; and Will, awake to the slightest hint in this direction,
19858: concluded that he was to be kept away from the Grange on Dorothea’s
19859: account. Her friends, then, regarded him with some suspicion? Their
19860: fears were quite superfluous: they were very much mistaken if they
19861: imagined that he would put himself forward as a needy adventurer trying
19862: to win the favor of a rich woman.
19863: 
19864: Until now Will had never fully seen the chasm between himself and
19865: Dorothea—until now that he was come to the brink of it, and saw her on
19866: the other side. He began, not without some inward rage, to think of
19867: going away from the neighborhood: it would be impossible for him to
19868: show any further interest in Dorothea without subjecting himself to
19869: disagreeable imputations—perhaps even in her mind, which others might
19870: try to poison.
19871: 
19872: “We are forever divided,” said Will. “I might as well be at Rome; she
19873: would be no farther from me.” But what we call our despair is often
19874: only the painful eagerness of unfed hope. There were plenty of reasons
19875: why he should not go—public reasons why he should not quit his post at
19876: this crisis, leaving Mr. Brooke in the lurch when he needed “coaching”
19877: for the election, and when there was so much canvassing, direct and
19878: indirect, to be carried on. Will could not like to leave his own
19879: chessmen in the heat of a game; and any candidate on the right side,
19880: even if his brain and marrow had been as soft as was consistent with a
19881: gentlemanly bearing, might help to turn a majority. To coach Mr. Brooke
19882: and keep him steadily to the idea that he must pledge himself to vote
19883: for the actual Reform Bill, instead of insisting on his independence
19884: and power of pulling up in time, was not an easy task. Mr.
19885: Farebrother’s prophecy of a fourth candidate “in the bag” had not yet
19886: been fulfilled, neither the Parliamentary Candidate Society nor any
19887: other power on the watch to secure a reforming majority seeing a worthy
19888: nodus for interference while there was a second reforming candidate
19889: like Mr. Brooke, who might be returned at his own expense; and the
19890: fight lay entirely between Pinkerton the old Tory member, Bagster the
19891: new Whig member returned at the last election, and Brooke the future
19892: independent member, who was to fetter himself for this occasion only.
19893: Mr. Hawley and his party would bend all their forces to the return of
19894: Pinkerton, and Mr. Brooke’s success must depend either on plumpers
19895: which would leave Bagster in the rear, or on the new minting of Tory
19896: votes into reforming votes. The latter means, of course, would be
19897: preferable.
19898: 
19899: This prospect of converting votes was a dangerous distraction to Mr.
19900: Brooke: his impression that waverers were likely to be allured by
19901: wavering statements, and also the liability of his mind to stick afresh
19902: at opposing arguments as they turned up in his memory, gave Will
19903: Ladislaw much trouble.
19904: 
19905: “You know there are tactics in these things,” said Mr. Brooke; “meeting
19906: people half-way—tempering your ideas—saying, ‘Well now, there’s
19907: something in that,’ and so on. I agree with you that this is a peculiar
19908: occasion—the country with a will of its own—political unions—that sort
19909: of thing—but we sometimes cut with rather too sharp a knife, Ladislaw.
19910: These ten-pound householders, now: why ten? Draw the line
19911: somewhere—yes: but why just at ten? That’s a difficult question, now,
19912: if you go into it.”
19913: 
19914: “Of course it is,” said Will, impatiently. “But if you are to wait till
19915: we get a logical Bill, you must put yourself forward as a
19916: revolutionist, and then Middlemarch would not elect you, I fancy. As
19917: for trimming, this is not a time for trimming.”
19918: 
19919: Mr. Brooke always ended by agreeing with Ladislaw, who still appeared
19920: to him a sort of Burke with a leaven of Shelley; but after an interval
19921: the wisdom of his own methods reasserted itself, and he was again drawn
19922: into using them with much hopefulness. At this stage of affairs he was
19923: in excellent spirits, which even supported him under large advances of
19924: money; for his powers of convincing and persuading had not yet been
19925: tested by anything more difficult than a chairman’s speech introducing
19926: other orators, or a dialogue with a Middlemarch voter, from which he
19927: came away with a sense that he was a tactician by nature, and that it
19928: was a pity he had not gone earlier into this kind of thing. He was a
19929: little conscious of defeat, however, with Mr. Mawmsey, a chief
19930: representative in Middlemarch of that great social power, the retail
19931: trader, and naturally one of the most doubtful voters in the
19932: borough—willing for his own part to supply an equal quality of teas and
19933: sugars to reformer and anti-reformer, as well as to agree impartially
19934: with both, and feeling like the burgesses of old that this necessity of
19935: electing members was a great burthen to a town; for even if there were
19936: no danger in holding out hopes to all parties beforehand, there would
19937: be the painful necessity at last of disappointing respectable people
19938: whose names were on his books. He was accustomed to receive large
19939: orders from Mr. Brooke of Tipton; but then, there were many of
19940: Pinkerton’s committee whose opinions had a great weight of grocery on
19941: their side. Mr. Mawmsey thinking that Mr. Brooke, as not too “clever in
19942: his intellects,” was the more likely to forgive a grocer who gave a
19943: hostile vote under pressure, had become confidential in his back
19944: parlor.
19945: 
19946: “As to Reform, sir, put it in a family light,” he said, rattling the
19947: small silver in his pocket, and smiling affably. “Will it support Mrs.
19948: Mawmsey, and enable her to bring up six children when I am no more? I
19949: put the question _fictiously_, knowing what must be the answer. Very
19950: well, sir. I ask you what, as a husband and a father, I am to do when
19951: gentlemen come to me and say, ‘Do as you like, Mawmsey; but if you vote
19952: against us, I shall get my groceries elsewhere: when I sugar my liquor
19953: I like to feel that I am benefiting the country by maintaining
19954: tradesmen of the right color.’ Those very words have been spoken to me,
19955: sir, in the very chair where you are now sitting. I don’t mean by your
19956: honorable self, Mr. Brooke.”
19957: 
19958: “No, no, no—that’s narrow, you know. Until my butler complains to me of
19959: your goods, Mr. Mawmsey,” said Mr. Brooke, soothingly, “until I hear
19960: that you send bad sugars, spices—that sort of thing—I shall never order
19961: him to go elsewhere.”
19962: 
19963: “Sir, I am your humble servant, and greatly obliged,” said Mr. Mawmsey,
19964: feeling that politics were clearing up a little. “There would be some
19965: pleasure in voting for a gentleman who speaks in that honorable
19966: manner.”
19967: 
19968: “Well, you know, Mr. Mawmsey, you would find it the right thing to put
19969: yourself on our side. This Reform will touch everybody by-and-by—a
19970: thoroughly popular measure—a sort of A, B, C, you know, that must come
19971: first before the rest can follow. I quite agree with you that you’ve
19972: got to look at the thing in a family light: but public spirit, now.
19973: We’re all one family, you know—it’s all one cupboard. Such a thing as a
19974: vote, now: why, it may help to make men’s fortunes at the Cape—there’s
19975: no knowing what may be the effect of a vote,” Mr. Brooke ended, with a
19976: sense of being a little out at sea, though finding it still enjoyable.
19977: But Mr. Mawmsey answered in a tone of decisive check.
19978: 
19979: “I beg your pardon, sir, but I can’t afford that. When I give a vote I
19980: must know what I am doing; I must look to what will be the effects on
19981: my till and ledger, speaking respectfully. Prices, I’ll admit, are what
19982: nobody can know the merits of; and the sudden falls after you’ve bought
19983: in currants, which are a goods that will not keep—I’ve never; myself
19984: seen into the ins and outs there; which is a rebuke to human pride. But
19985: as to one family, there’s debtor and creditor, I hope; they’re not
19986: going to reform that away; else I should vote for things staying as
19987: they are. Few men have less need to cry for change than I have,
19988: personally speaking—that is, for self and family. I am not one of those
19989: who have nothing to lose: I mean as to respectability both in parish
19990: and private business, and noways in respect of your honorable self and
19991: custom, which you was good enough to say you would not withdraw from
19992: me, vote or no vote, while the article sent in was satisfactory.”
19993: 
19994: After this conversation Mr. Mawmsey went up and boasted to his wife
19995: that he had been rather too many for Brooke of Tipton, and that he
19996: didn’t mind so much now about going to the poll.
19997: 
19998: Mr. Brooke on this occasion abstained from boasting of his tactics to
19999: Ladislaw, who for his part was glad enough to persuade himself that he
20000: had no concern with any canvassing except the purely argumentative
20001: sort, and that he worked no meaner engine than knowledge. Mr. Brooke,
20002: necessarily, had his agents, who understood the nature of the
20003: Middlemarch voter and the means of enlisting his ignorance on the side
20004: of the Bill—which were remarkably similar to the means of enlisting it
20005: on the side against the Bill. Will stopped his ears. Occasionally
20006: Parliament, like the rest of our lives, even to our eating and apparel,
20007: could hardly go on if our imaginations were too active about processes.
20008: There were plenty of dirty-handed men in the world to do dirty
20009: business; and Will protested to himself that his share in bringing Mr.
20010: Brooke through would be quite innocent.
20011: 
20012: But whether he should succeed in that mode of contributing to the
20013: majority on the right side was very doubtful to him. He had written out
20014: various speeches and memoranda for speeches, but he had begun to
20015: perceive that Mr. Brooke’s mind, if it had the burthen of remembering
20016: any train of thought, would let it drop, run away in search of it, and
20017: not easily come back again. To collect documents is one mode of serving
20018: your country, and to remember the contents of a document is another.
20019: No! the only way in which Mr. Brooke could be coerced into thinking of
20020: the right arguments at the right time was to be well plied with them
20021: till they took up all the room in his brain. But here there was the
20022: difficulty of finding room, so many things having been taken in
20023: beforehand. Mr. Brooke himself observed that his ideas stood rather in
20024: his way when he was speaking.
20025: 
20026: However, Ladislaw’s coaching was forthwith to be put to the test, for
20027: before the day of nomination Mr. Brooke was to explain himself to the
20028: worthy electors of Middlemarch from the balcony of the White Hart,
20029: which looked out advantageously at an angle of the market-place,
20030: commanding a large area in front and two converging streets. It was a
20031: fine May morning, and everything seemed hopeful: there was some
20032: prospect of an understanding between Bagster’s committee and Brooke’s,
20033: to which Mr. Bulstrode, Mr. Standish as a Liberal lawyer, and such
20034: manufacturers as Mr. Plymdale and Mr. Vincy, gave a solidity which
20035: almost counterbalanced Mr. Hawley and his associates who sat for
20036: Pinkerton at the Green Dragon. Mr. Brooke, conscious of having weakened
20037: the blasts of the “Trumpet” against him, by his reforms as a landlord
20038: in the last half year, and hearing himself cheered a little as he drove
20039: into the town, felt his heart tolerably light under his buff-colored
20040: waistcoat. But with regard to critical occasions, it often happens that
20041: all moments seem comfortably remote until the last.
20042: 
20043: “This looks well, eh?” said Mr. Brooke as the crowd gathered. “I shall
20044: have a good audience, at any rate. I like this, now—this kind of public
20045: made up of one’s own neighbors, you know.”
20046: 
20047: The weavers and tanners of Middlemarch, unlike Mr. Mawmsey, had never
20048: thought of Mr. Brooke as a neighbor, and were not more attached to him
20049: than if he had been sent in a box from London. But they listened
20050: without much disturbance to the speakers who introduced the candidate,
20051: one of them—a political personage from Brassing, who came to tell
20052: Middlemarch its duty—spoke so fully, that it was alarming to think what
20053: the candidate could find to say after him. Meanwhile the crowd became
20054: denser, and as the political personage neared the end of his speech,
20055: Mr. Brooke felt a remarkable change in his sensations while he still
20056: handled his eye-glass, trifled with documents before him, and exchanged
20057: remarks with his committee, as a man to whom the moment of summons was
20058: indifferent.
20059: 
20060: “I’ll take another glass of sherry, Ladislaw,” he said, with an easy
20061: air, to Will, who was close behind him, and presently handed him the
20062: supposed fortifier. It was ill-chosen; for Mr. Brooke was an abstemious
20063: man, and to drink a second glass of sherry quickly at no great interval
20064: from the first was a surprise to his system which tended to scatter his
20065: energies instead of collecting them. Pray pity him: so many English
20066: gentlemen make themselves miserable by speechifying on entirely private
20067: grounds! whereas Mr. Brooke wished to serve his country by standing for
20068: Parliament—which, indeed, may also be done on private grounds, but
20069: being once undertaken does absolutely demand some speechifying.
20070: 
20071: It was not about the beginning of his speech that Mr. Brooke was at all
20072: anxious; this, he felt sure, would be all right; he should have it
20073: quite pat, cut out as neatly as a set of couplets from Pope. Embarking
20074: would be easy, but the vision of open sea that might come after was
20075: alarming. “And questions, now,” hinted the demon just waking up in his
20076: stomach, “somebody may put questions about the schedules.—Ladislaw,” he
20077: continued, aloud, “just hand me the memorandum of the schedules.”
20078: 
20079: When Mr. Brooke presented himself on the balcony, the cheers were quite
20080: loud enough to counterbalance the yells, groans, brayings, and other
20081: expressions of adverse theory, which were so moderate that Mr. Standish
20082: (decidedly an old bird) observed in the ear next to him, “This looks
20083: dangerous, by God! Hawley has got some deeper plan than this.” Still,
20084: the cheers were exhilarating, and no candidate could look more amiable
20085: than Mr. Brooke, with the memorandum in his breast-pocket, his left
20086: hand on the rail of the balcony, and his right trifling with his
20087: eye-glass. The striking points in his appearance were his buff
20088: waistcoat, short-clipped blond hair, and neutral physiognomy. He began
20089: with some confidence.
20090: 
20091: “Gentlemen—Electors of Middlemarch!”
20092: 
20093: This was so much the right thing that a little pause after it seemed
20094: natural.
20095: 
20096: “I’m uncommonly glad to be here—I was never so proud and happy in my
20097: life—never so happy, you know.”
20098: 
20099: This was a bold figure of speech, but not exactly the right thing; for,
20100: unhappily, the pat opening had slipped away—even couplets from Pope may
20101: be but “fallings from us, vanishings,” when fear clutches us, and a
20102: glass of sherry is hurrying like smoke among our ideas. Ladislaw, who
20103: stood at the window behind the speaker, thought, “it’s all up now. The
20104: only chance is that, since the best thing won’t always do, floundering
20105: may answer for once.” Mr. Brooke, meanwhile, having lost other clews,
20106: fell back on himself and his qualifications—always an appropriate
20107: graceful subject for a candidate.
20108: 
20109: “I am a close neighbor of yours, my good friends—you’ve known me on the
20110: bench a good while—I’ve always gone a good deal into public
20111: questions—machinery, now, and machine-breaking—you’re many of you
20112: concerned with machinery, and I’ve been going into that lately. It
20113: won’t do, you know, breaking machines: everything must go on—trade,
20114: manufactures, commerce, interchange of staples—that kind of thing—since
20115: Adam Smith, that must go on. We must look all over the
20116: globe:—‘Observation with extensive view,’ must look everywhere, ‘from
20117: China to Peru,’ as somebody says—Johnson, I think, ‘The Rambler,’ you
20118: know. That is what I have done up to a certain point—not as far as
20119: Peru; but I’ve not always stayed at home—I saw it wouldn’t do. I’ve
20120: been in the Levant, where some of your Middlemarch goods go—and then,
20121: again, in the Baltic. The Baltic, now.”
20122: 
20123: Plying among his recollections in this way, Mr. Brooke might have got
20124: along, easily to himself, and would have come back from the remotest
20125: seas without trouble; but a diabolical procedure had been set up by the
20126: enemy. At one and the same moment there had risen above the shoulders
20127: of the crowd, nearly opposite Mr. Brooke, and within ten yards of him,
20128: the effigy of himself: buff-colored waistcoat, eye-glass, and neutral
20129: physiognomy, painted on rag; and there had arisen, apparently in the
20130: air, like the note of the cuckoo, a parrot-like, Punch-voiced echo of
20131: his words. Everybody looked up at the open windows in the houses at the
20132: opposite angles of the converging streets; but they were either blank,
20133: or filled by laughing listeners. The most innocent echo has an impish
20134: mockery in it when it follows a gravely persistent speaker, and this
20135: echo was not at all innocent; if it did not follow with the precision
20136: of a natural echo, it had a wicked choice of the words it overtook. By
20137: the time it said, “The Baltic, now,” the laugh which had been running
20138: through the audience became a general shout, and but for the sobering
20139: effects of party and that great public cause which the entanglement of
20140: things had identified with “Brooke of Tipton,” the laugh might have
20141: caught his committee. Mr. Bulstrode asked, reprehensively, what the new
20142: police was doing; but a voice could not well be collared, and an attack
20143: on the effigy of the candidate would have been too equivocal, since
20144: Hawley probably meant it to be pelted.
20145: 
20146: Mr. Brooke himself was not in a position to be quickly conscious of
20147: anything except a general slipping away of ideas within himself: he had
20148: even a little singing in the ears, and he was the only person who had
20149: not yet taken distinct account of the echo or discerned the image of
20150: himself. Few things hold the perceptions more thoroughly captive than
20151: anxiety about what we have got to say. Mr. Brooke heard the laughter;
20152: but he had expected some Tory efforts at disturbance, and he was at
20153: this moment additionally excited by the tickling, stinging sense that
20154: his lost exordium was coming back to fetch him from the Baltic.
20155: 
20156: “That reminds me,” he went on, thrusting a hand into his side-pocket,
20157: with an easy air, “if I wanted a precedent, you know—but we never want
20158: a precedent for the right thing—but there is Chatham, now; I can’t say
20159: I should have supported Chatham, or Pitt, the younger Pitt—he was not a
20160: man of ideas, and we want ideas, you know.”
20161: 
20162: “Blast your ideas! we want the Bill,” said a loud rough voice from the
20163: crowd below.
20164: 
20165: Immediately the invisible Punch, who had hitherto followed Mr. Brooke,
20166: repeated, “Blast your ideas! we want the Bill.” The laugh was louder
20167: than ever, and for the first time Mr. Brooke being himself silent,
20168: heard distinctly the mocking echo. But it seemed to ridicule his
20169: interrupter, and in that light was encouraging; so he replied with
20170: amenity—
20171: 
20172: “There is something in what you say, my good friend, and what do we
20173: meet for but to speak our minds—freedom of opinion, freedom of the
20174: press, liberty—that kind of thing? The Bill, now—you shall have the
20175: Bill”—here Mr. Brooke paused a moment to fix on his eye-glass and take
20176: the paper from his breast-pocket, with a sense of being practical and
20177: coming to particulars. The invisible Punch followed:—
20178: 
20179: “You shall have the Bill, Mr. Brooke, per electioneering contest, and a
20180: seat outside Parliament as delivered, five thousand pounds, seven
20181: shillings, and fourpence.”
20182: 
20183: Mr. Brooke, amid the roars of laughter, turned red, let his eye-glass
20184: fall, and looking about him confusedly, saw the image of himself, which
20185: had come nearer. The next moment he saw it dolorously bespattered with
20186: eggs. His spirit rose a little, and his voice too.
20187: 
20188: “Buffoonery, tricks, ridicule the test of truth—all that is very
20189: well”—here an unpleasant egg broke on Mr. Brooke’s shoulder, as the
20190: echo said, “All that is very well;” then came a hail of eggs, chiefly
20191: aimed at the image, but occasionally hitting the original, as if by
20192: chance. There was a stream of new men pushing among the crowd;
20193: whistles, yells, bellowings, and fifes made all the greater hubbub
20194: because there was shouting and struggling to put them down. No voice
20195: would have had wing enough to rise above the uproar, and Mr. Brooke,
20196: disagreeably anointed, stood his ground no longer. The frustration
20197: would have been less exasperating if it had been less gamesome and
20198: boyish: a serious assault of which the newspaper reporter “can aver
20199: that it endangered the learned gentleman’s ribs,” or can respectfully
20200: bear witness to “the soles of that gentleman’s boots having been
20201: visible above the railing,” has perhaps more consolations attached to
20202: it.
20203: 
20204: Mr. Brooke re-entered the committee-room, saying, as carelessly as he
20205: could, “This is a little too bad, you know. I should have got the ear
20206: of the people by-and-by—but they didn’t give me time. I should have
20207: gone into the Bill by-and-by, you know,” he added, glancing at
20208: Ladislaw. “However, things will come all right at the nomination.”
20209: 
20210: But it was not resolved unanimously that things would come right; on
20211: the contrary, the committee looked rather grim, and the political
20212: personage from Brassing was writing busily, as if he were brewing new
20213: devices.
20214: 
20215: “It was Bowyer who did it,” said Mr. Standish, evasively. “I know it as
20216: well as if he had been advertised. He’s uncommonly good at
20217: ventriloquism, and he did it uncommonly well, by God! Hawley has been
20218: having him to dinner lately: there’s a fund of talent in Bowyer.”
20219: 
20220: “Well, you know, you never mentioned him to me, Standish, else I would
20221: have invited him to dine,” said poor Mr. Brooke, who had gone through a
20222: great deal of inviting for the good of his country.
20223: 
20224: “There’s not a more paltry fellow in Middlemarch than Bowyer,” said
20225: Ladislaw, indignantly, “but it seems as if the paltry fellows were
20226: always to turn the scale.”
20227: 
20228: Will was thoroughly out of temper with himself as well as with his
20229: “principal,” and he went to shut himself in his rooms with a
20230: half-formed resolve to throw up the “Pioneer” and Mr. Brooke together.
20231: Why should he stay? If the impassable gulf between himself and Dorothea
20232: were ever to be filled up, it must rather be by his going away and
20233: getting into a thoroughly different position than by staying here and
20234: slipping into deserved contempt as an understrapper of Brooke’s. Then
20235: came the young dream of wonders that he might do—in five years, for
20236: example: political writing, political speaking, would get a higher
20237: value now public life was going to be wider and more national, and they
20238: might give him such distinction that he would not seem to be asking
20239: Dorothea to step down to him. Five years:—if he could only be sure that
20240: she cared for him more than for others; if he could only make her aware
20241: that he stood aloof until he could tell his love without lowering
20242: himself—then he could go away easily, and begin a career which at
20243: five-and-twenty seemed probable enough in the inward order of things,
20244: where talent brings fame, and fame everything else which is delightful.
20245: He could speak and he could write; he could master any subject if he
20246: chose, and he meant always to take the side of reason and justice, on
20247: which he would carry all his ardor. Why should he not one day be lifted
20248: above the shoulders of the crowd, and feel that he had won that
20249: eminence well? Without doubt he would leave Middlemarch, go to town,
20250: and make himself fit for celebrity by “eating his dinners.”
20251: 
20252: But not immediately: not until some kind of sign had passed between him
20253: and Dorothea. He could not be satisfied until she knew why, even if he
20254: were the man she would choose to marry, he would not marry her. Hence
20255: he must keep his post and bear with Mr. Brooke a little longer.
20256: 
20257: But he soon had reason to suspect that Mr. Brooke had anticipated him
20258: in the wish to break up their connection. Deputations without and
20259: voices within had concurred in inducing that philanthropist to take a
20260: stronger measure than usual for the good of mankind; namely, to
20261: withdraw in favor of another candidate, to whom he left the advantages
20262: of his canvassing machinery. He himself called this a strong measure,
20263: but observed that his health was less capable of sustaining excitement
20264: than he had imagined.
20265: 
20266: “I have felt uneasy about the chest—it won’t do to carry that too far,”
20267: he said to Ladislaw in explaining the affair. “I must pull up. Poor
20268: Casaubon was a warning, you know. I’ve made some heavy advances, but
20269: I’ve dug a channel. It’s rather coarse work—this electioneering, eh,
20270: Ladislaw? dare say you are tired of it. However, we have dug a channel
20271: with the ‘Pioneer’—put things in a track, and so on. A more ordinary
20272: man than you might carry it on now—more ordinary, you know.”
20273: 
20274: “Do you wish me to give it up?” said Will, the quick color coming in
20275: his face, as he rose from the writing-table, and took a turn of three
20276: steps with his hands in his pockets. “I am ready to do so whenever you
20277: wish it.”
20278: 
20279: “As to wishing, my dear Ladislaw, I have the highest opinion of your
20280: powers, you know. But about the ‘Pioneer,’ I have been consulting a
20281: little with some of the men on our side, and they are inclined to take
20282: it into their hands—indemnify me to a certain extent—carry it on, in
20283: fact. And under the circumstances, you might like to give up—might find
20284: a better field. These people might not take that high view of you which
20285: I have always taken, as an alter ego, a right hand—though I always
20286: looked forward to your doing something else. I think of having a run
20287: into France. But I’ll write you any letters, you know—to Althorpe and
20288: people of that kind. I’ve met Althorpe.”
20289: 
20290: “I am exceedingly obliged to you,” said Ladislaw, proudly. “Since you
20291: are going to part with the ‘Pioneer,’ I need not trouble you about the
20292: steps I shall take. I may choose to continue here for the present.”
20293: 
20294: After Mr. Brooke had left him Will said to himself, “The rest of the
20295: family have been urging him to get rid of me, and he doesn’t care now
20296: about my going. I shall stay as long as I like. I shall go of my own
20297: movements and not because they are afraid of me.”
20298: 
20299: 
20300: 
20301: 
20302: CHAPTER LII.
20303: 
20304: “His heart
20305: The lowliest duties on itself did lay.”
20306: —WORDSWORTH.
20307: 
20308: 
20309: On that June evening when Mr. Farebrother knew that he was to have the
20310: Lowick living, there was joy in the old fashioned parlor, and even the
20311: portraits of the great lawyers seemed to look on with satisfaction. His
20312: mother left her tea and toast untouched, but sat with her usual pretty
20313: primness, only showing her emotion by that flush in the cheeks and
20314: brightness in the eyes which give an old woman a touching momentary
20315: identity with her far-off youthful self, and saying decisively—
20316: 
20317: “The greatest comfort, Camden, is that you have deserved it.”
20318: 
20319: “When a man gets a good berth, mother, half the deserving must come
20320: after,” said the son, brimful of pleasure, and not trying to conceal
20321: it. The gladness in his face was of that active kind which seems to
20322: have energy enough not only to flash outwardly, but to light up busy
20323: vision within: one seemed to see thoughts, as well as delight, in his
20324: glances.
20325: 
20326: “Now, aunt,” he went on, rubbing his hands and looking at Miss Noble,
20327: who was making tender little beaver-like noises, “There shall be
20328: sugar-candy always on the table for you to steal and give to the
20329: children, and you shall have a great many new stockings to make
20330: presents of, and you shall darn your own more than ever!”
20331: 
20332: Miss Noble nodded at her nephew with a subdued half-frightened laugh,
20333: conscious of having already dropped an additional lump of sugar into
20334: her basket on the strength of the new preferment.
20335: 
20336: “As for you, Winny”—the Vicar went on—“I shall make no difficulty about
20337: your marrying any Lowick bachelor—Mr. Solomon Featherstone, for
20338: example, as soon as I find you are in love with him.”
20339: 
20340: Miss Winifred, who had been looking at her brother all the while and
20341: crying heartily, which was her way of rejoicing, smiled through her
20342: tears and said, “You must set me the example, Cam: _you_ must marry
20343: now.”
20344: 
20345: “With all my heart. But who is in love with me? I am a seedy old
20346: fellow,” said the Vicar, rising, pushing his chair away and looking
20347: down at himself. “What do you say, mother?”
20348: 
20349: “You are a handsome man, Camden: though not so fine a figure of a man
20350: as your father,” said the old lady.
20351: 
20352: “I wish you would marry Miss Garth, brother,” said Miss Winifred. “She
20353: would make us so lively at Lowick.”
20354: 
20355: “Very fine! You talk as if young women were tied up to be chosen, like
20356: poultry at market; as if I had only to ask and everybody would have
20357: me,” said the Vicar, not caring to specify.
20358: 
20359: “We don’t want everybody,” said Miss Winifred. “But _you_ would like
20360: Miss Garth, mother, shouldn’t you?”
20361: 
20362: “My son’s choice shall be mine,” said Mrs. Farebrother, with majestic
20363: discretion, “and a wife would be most welcome, Camden. You will want
20364: your whist at home when we go to Lowick, and Henrietta Noble never was
20365: a whist-player.” (Mrs. Farebrother always called her tiny old sister by
20366: that magnificent name.)
20367: 
20368: “I shall do without whist now, mother.”
20369: 
20370: “Why so, Camden? In my time whist was thought an undeniable amusement
20371: for a good churchman,” said Mrs. Farebrother, innocent of the meaning
20372: that whist had for her son, and speaking rather sharply, as at some
20373: dangerous countenancing of new doctrine.
20374: 
20375: “I shall be too busy for whist; I shall have two parishes,” said the
20376: Vicar, preferring not to discuss the virtues of that game.
20377: 
20378: He had already said to Dorothea, “I don’t feel bound to give up St.
20379: Botolph’s. It is protest enough against the pluralism they want to
20380: reform if I give somebody else most of the money. The stronger thing is
20381: not to give up power, but to use it well.”
20382: 
20383: “I have thought of that,” said Dorothea. “So far as self is concerned,
20384: I think it would be easier to give up power and money than to keep
20385: them. It seems very unfitting that I should have this patronage, yet I
20386: felt that I ought not to let it be used by some one else instead of
20387: me.”
20388: 
20389: “It is I who am bound to act so that you will not regret your power,”
20390: said Mr. Farebrother.
20391: 
20392: His was one of the natures in which conscience gets the more active
20393: when the yoke of life ceases to gall them. He made no display of
20394: humility on the subject, but in his heart he felt rather ashamed that
20395: his conduct had shown laches which others who did not get benefices
20396: were free from.
20397: 
20398: “I used often to wish I had been something else than a clergyman,” he
20399: said to Lydgate, “but perhaps it will be better to try and make as good
20400: a clergyman out of myself as I can. That is the well-beneficed point of
20401: view, you perceive, from which difficulties are much simplified,” he
20402: ended, smiling.
20403: 
20404: The Vicar did feel then as if his share of duties would be easy. But
20405: Duty has a trick of behaving unexpectedly—something like a heavy friend
20406: whom we have amiably asked to visit us, and who breaks his leg within
20407: our gates.
20408: 
20409: Hardly a week later, Duty presented itself in his study under the
20410: disguise of Fred Vincy, now returned from Omnibus College with his
20411: bachelor’s degree.
20412: 
20413: “I am ashamed to trouble you, Mr. Farebrother,” said Fred, whose fair
20414: open face was propitiating, “but you are the only friend I can consult.
20415: I told you everything once before, and you were so good that I can’t
20416: help coming to you again.”
20417: 
20418: “Sit down, Fred, I’m ready to hear and do anything I can,” said the
20419: Vicar, who was busy packing some small objects for removal, and went on
20420: with his work.
20421: 
20422: “I wanted to tell you—” Fred hesitated an instant and then went on
20423: plungingly, “I might go into the Church now; and really, look where I
20424: may, I can’t see anything else to do. I don’t like it, but I know it’s
20425: uncommonly hard on my father to say so, after he has spent a good deal
20426: of money in educating me for it.” Fred paused again an instant, and
20427: then repeated, “and I can’t see anything else to do.”
20428: 
20429: “I did talk to your father about it, Fred, but I made little way with
20430: him. He said it was too late. But you have got over one bridge now:
20431: what are your other difficulties?”
20432: 
20433: “Merely that I don’t like it. I don’t like divinity, and preaching, and
20434: feeling obliged to look serious. I like riding across country, and
20435: doing as other men do. I don’t mean that I want to be a bad fellow in
20436: any way; but I’ve no taste for the sort of thing people expect of a
20437: clergyman. And yet what else am I to do? My father can’t spare me any
20438: capital, else I might go into farming. And he has no room for me in his
20439: trade. And of course I can’t begin to study for law or physic now, when
20440: my father wants me to earn something. It’s all very well to say I’m
20441: wrong to go into the Church; but those who say so might as well tell me
20442: to go into the backwoods.”
20443: 
20444: Fred’s voice had taken a tone of grumbling remonstrance, and Mr.
20445: Farebrother might have been inclined to smile if his mind had not been
20446: too busy in imagining more than Fred told him.
20447: 
20448: “Have you any difficulties about doctrines—about the Articles?” he
20449: said, trying hard to think of the question simply for Fred’s sake.
20450: 
20451: “No; I suppose the Articles are right. I am not prepared with any
20452: arguments to disprove them, and much better, cleverer fellows than I am
20453: go in for them entirely. I think it would be rather ridiculous in me to
20454: urge scruples of that sort, as if I were a judge,” said Fred, quite
20455: simply.
20456: 
20457: “I suppose, then, it has occurred to you that you might be a fair
20458: parish priest without being much of a divine?”
20459: 
20460: “Of course, if I am obliged to be a clergyman, I shall try and do my
20461: duty, though I mayn’t like it. Do you think any body ought to blame
20462: me?”
20463: 
20464: “For going into the Church under the circumstances? That depends on
20465: your conscience, Fred—how far you have counted the cost, and seen what
20466: your position will require of you. I can only tell you about myself,
20467: that I have always been too lax, and have been uneasy in consequence.”
20468: 
20469: “But there is another hindrance,” said Fred, coloring. “I did not tell
20470: you before, though perhaps I may have said things that made you guess
20471: it. There is somebody I am very fond of: I have loved her ever since we
20472: were children.”
20473: 
20474: “Miss Garth, I suppose?” said the Vicar, examining some labels very
20475: closely.
20476: 
20477: “Yes. I shouldn’t mind anything if she would have me. And I know I
20478: could be a good fellow then.”
20479: 
20480: “And you think she returns the feeling?”
20481: 
20482: “She never will say so; and a good while ago she made me promise not to
20483: speak to her about it again. And she has set her mind especially
20484: against my being a clergyman; I know that. But I can’t give her up. I
20485: do think she cares about me. I saw Mrs. Garth last night, and she said
20486: that Mary was staying at Lowick Rectory with Miss Farebrother.”
20487: 
20488: “Yes, she is very kindly helping my sister. Do you wish to go there?”
20489: 
20490: “No, I want to ask a great favor of you. I am ashamed to bother you in
20491: this way; but Mary might listen to what you said, if you mentioned the
20492: subject to her—I mean about my going into the Church.”
20493: 
20494: “That is rather a delicate task, my dear Fred. I shall have to
20495: presuppose your attachment to her; and to enter on the subject as you
20496: wish me to do, will be asking her to tell me whether she returns it.”
20497: 
20498: “That is what I want her to tell you,” said Fred, bluntly. “I don’t
20499: know what to do, unless I can get at her feeling.”
20500: 
20501: “You mean that you would be guided by that as to your going into the
20502: Church?”
20503: 
20504: “If Mary said she would never have me I might as well go wrong in one
20505: way as another.”
20506: 
20507: “That is nonsense, Fred. Men outlive their love, but they don’t outlive
20508: the consequences of their recklessness.”
20509: 
20510: “Not my sort of love: I have never been without loving Mary. If I had
20511: to give her up, it would be like beginning to live on wooden legs.”
20512: 
20513: “Will she not be hurt at my intrusion?”
20514: 
20515: “No, I feel sure she will not. She respects you more than any one, and
20516: she would not put you off with fun as she does me. Of course I could
20517: not have told any one else, or asked any one else to speak to her, but
20518: you. There is no one else who could be such a friend to both of us.”
20519: Fred paused a moment, and then said, rather complainingly, “And she
20520: ought to acknowledge that I have worked in order to pass. She ought to
20521: believe that I would exert myself for her sake.”
20522: 
20523: There was a moment’s silence before Mr. Farebrother laid down his work,
20524: and putting out his hand to Fred said—
20525: 
20526: “Very well, my boy. I will do what you wish.”
20527: 
20528: That very day Mr. Farebrother went to Lowick parsonage on the nag which
20529: he had just set up. “Decidedly I am an old stalk,” he thought, “the
20530: young growths are pushing me aside.”
20531: 
20532: He found Mary in the garden gathering roses and sprinkling the petals
20533: on a sheet. The sun was low, and tall trees sent their shadows across
20534: the grassy walks where Mary was moving without bonnet or parasol. She
20535: did not observe Mr. Farebrother’s approach along the grass, and had
20536: just stooped down to lecture a small black-and-tan terrier, which would
20537: persist in walking on the sheet and smelling at the rose-leaves as Mary
20538: sprinkled them. She took his fore-paws in one hand, and lifted up the
20539: forefinger of the other, while the dog wrinkled his brows and looked
20540: embarrassed. “Fly, Fly, I am ashamed of you,” Mary was saying in a
20541: grave contralto. “This is not becoming in a sensible dog; anybody would
20542: think you were a silly young gentleman.”
20543: 
20544: “You are unmerciful to young gentlemen, Miss Garth,” said the Vicar,
20545: within two yards of her.
20546: 
20547: Mary started up and blushed. “It always answers to reason with Fly,”
20548: she said, laughingly.
20549: 
20550: “But not with young gentlemen?”
20551: 
20552: “Oh, with some, I suppose; since some of them turn into excellent men.”
20553: 
20554: “I am glad of that admission, because I want at this very moment to
20555: interest you in a young gentleman.”
20556: 
20557: “Not a silly one, I hope,” said Mary, beginning to pluck the roses
20558: again, and feeling her heart beat uncomfortably.
20559: 
20560: “No; though perhaps wisdom is not his strong point, but rather
20561: affection and sincerity. However, wisdom lies more in those two
20562: qualities than people are apt to imagine. I hope you know by those
20563: marks what young gentleman I mean.”
20564: 
20565: “Yes, I think I do,” said Mary, bravely, her face getting more serious,
20566: and her hands cold; “it must be Fred Vincy.”
20567: 
20568: “He has asked me to consult you about his going into the Church. I hope
20569: you will not think that I consented to take a liberty in promising to
20570: do so.”
20571: 
20572: “On the contrary, Mr. Farebrother,” said Mary, giving up the roses, and
20573: folding her arms, but unable to look up, “whenever you have anything to
20574: say to me I feel honored.”
20575: 
20576: “But before I enter on that question, let me just touch a point on
20577: which your father took me into confidence; by the way, it was that very
20578: evening on which I once before fulfilled a mission from Fred, just
20579: after he had gone to college. Mr. Garth told me what happened on the
20580: night of Featherstone’s death—how you refused to burn the will; and he
20581: said that you had some heart-prickings on that subject, because you had
20582: been the innocent means of hindering Fred from getting his ten thousand
20583: pounds. I have kept that in mind, and I have heard something that may
20584: relieve you on that score—may show you that no sin-offering is demanded
20585: from you there.”
20586: 
20587: Mr. Farebrother paused a moment and looked at Mary. He meant to give
20588: Fred his full advantage, but it would be well, he thought, to clear her
20589: mind of any superstitions, such as women sometimes follow when they do
20590: a man the wrong of marrying him as an act of atonement. Mary’s cheeks
20591: had begun to burn a little, and she was mute.
20592: 
20593: “I mean, that your action made no real difference to Fred’s lot. I find
20594: that the first will would not have been legally good after the burning
20595: of the last; it would not have stood if it had been disputed, and you
20596: may be sure it would have been disputed. So, on that score, you may
20597: feel your mind free.”
20598: 
20599: “Thank you, Mr. Farebrother,” said Mary, earnestly. “I am grateful to
20600: you for remembering my feelings.”
20601: 
20602: “Well, now I may go on. Fred, you know, has taken his degree. He has
20603: worked his way so far, and now the question is, what is he to do? That
20604: question is so difficult that he is inclined to follow his father’s
20605: wishes and enter the Church, though you know better than I do that he
20606: was quite set against that formerly. I have questioned him on the
20607: subject, and I confess I see no insuperable objection to his being a
20608: clergyman, as things go. He says that he could turn his mind to doing
20609: his best in that vocation, on one condition. If that condition were
20610: fulfilled I would do my utmost in helping Fred on. After a time—not, of
20611: course, at first—he might be with me as my curate, and he would have so
20612: much to do that his stipend would be nearly what I used to get as
20613: vicar. But I repeat that there is a condition without which all this
20614: good cannot come to pass. He has opened his heart to me, Miss Garth,
20615: and asked me to plead for him. The condition lies entirely in your
20616: feeling.”
20617: 
20618: Mary looked so much moved, that he said after a moment, “Let us walk a
20619: little;” and when they were walking he added, “To speak quite plainly,
20620: Fred will not take any course which would lessen the chance that you
20621: would consent to be his wife; but with that prospect, he will try his
20622: best at anything you approve.”
20623: 
20624: “I cannot possibly say that I will ever be his wife, Mr. Farebrother:
20625: but I certainly never will be his wife if he becomes a clergyman. What
20626: you say is most generous and kind; I don’t mean for a moment to correct
20627: your judgment. It is only that I have my girlish, mocking way of
20628: looking at things,” said Mary, with a returning sparkle of playfulness
20629: in her answer which only made its modesty more charming.
20630: 
20631: “He wishes me to report exactly what you think,” said Mr. Farebrother.
20632: 
20633: “I could not love a man who is ridiculous,” said Mary, not choosing to
20634: go deeper. “Fred has sense and knowledge enough to make him
20635: respectable, if he likes, in some good worldly business, but I can
20636: never imagine him preaching and exhorting, and pronouncing blessings,
20637: and praying by the sick, without feeling as if I were looking at a
20638: caricature. His being a clergyman would be only for gentility’s sake,
20639: and I think there is nothing more contemptible than such imbecile
20640: gentility. I used to think that of Mr. Crowse, with his empty face and
20641: neat umbrella, and mincing little speeches. What right have such men to
20642: represent Christianity—as if it were an institution for getting up
20643: idiots genteelly—as if—” Mary checked herself. She had been carried
20644: along as if she had been speaking to Fred instead of Mr. Farebrother.
20645: 
20646: “Young women are severe: they don’t feel the stress of action as men
20647: do, though perhaps I ought to make you an exception there. But you
20648: don’t put Fred Vincy on so low a level as that?”
20649: 
20650: “No, indeed, he has plenty of sense, but I think he would not show it
20651: as a clergyman. He would be a piece of professional affectation.”
20652: 
20653: “Then the answer is quite decided. As a clergyman he could have no
20654: hope?”
20655: 
20656: Mary shook her head.
20657: 
20658: “But if he braved all the difficulties of getting his bread in some
20659: other way—will you give him the support of hope? May he count on
20660: winning you?”
20661: 
20662: “I think Fred ought not to need telling again what I have already said
20663: to him,” Mary answered, with a slight resentment in her manner. “I mean
20664: that he ought not to put such questions until he has done something
20665: worthy, instead of saying that he could do it.”
20666: 
20667: Mr. Farebrother was silent for a minute or more, and then, as they
20668: turned and paused under the shadow of a maple at the end of a grassy
20669: walk, said, “I understand that you resist any attempt to fetter you,
20670: but either your feeling for Fred Vincy excludes your entertaining
20671: another attachment, or it does not: either he may count on your
20672: remaining single until he shall have earned your hand, or he may in any
20673: case be disappointed. Pardon me, Mary—you know I used to catechise you
20674: under that name—but when the state of a woman’s affections touches the
20675: happiness of another life—of more lives than one—I think it would be
20676: the nobler course for her to be perfectly direct and open.”
20677: 
20678: Mary in her turn was silent, wondering not at Mr. Farebrother’s manner
20679: but at his tone, which had a grave restrained emotion in it. When the
20680: strange idea flashed across her that his words had reference to
20681: himself, she was incredulous, and ashamed of entertaining it. She had
20682: never thought that any man could love her except Fred, who had espoused
20683: her with the umbrella ring, when she wore socks and little strapped
20684: shoes; still less that she could be of any importance to Mr.
20685: Farebrother, the cleverest man in her narrow circle. She had only time
20686: to feel that all this was hazy and perhaps illusory; but one thing was
20687: clear and determined—her answer.
20688: 
20689: “Since you think it my duty, Mr. Farebrother, I will tell you that I
20690: have too strong a feeling for Fred to give him up for any one else. I
20691: should never be quite happy if I thought he was unhappy for the loss of
20692: me. It has taken such deep root in me—my gratitude to him for always
20693: loving me best, and minding so much if I hurt myself, from the time
20694: when we were very little. I cannot imagine any new feeling coming to
20695: make that weaker. I should like better than anything to see him worthy
20696: of every one’s respect. But please tell him I will not promise to marry
20697: him till then: I should shame and grieve my father and mother. He is
20698: free to choose some one else.”
20699: 
20700: “Then I have fulfilled my commission thoroughly,” said Mr. Farebrother,
20701: putting out his hand to Mary, “and I shall ride back to Middlemarch
20702: forthwith. With this prospect before him, we shall get Fred into the
20703: right niche somehow, and I hope I shall live to join your hands. God
20704: bless you!”
20705: 
20706: “Oh, please stay, and let me give you some tea,” said Mary. Her eyes
20707: filled with tears, for something indefinable, something like the
20708: resolute suppression of a pain in Mr. Farebrother’s manner, made her
20709: feel suddenly miserable, as she had once felt when she saw her father’s
20710: hands trembling in a moment of trouble.
20711: 
20712: “No, my dear, no. I must get back.”
20713: 
20714: In three minutes the Vicar was on horseback again, having gone
20715: magnanimously through a duty much harder than the renunciation of
20716: whist, or even than the writing of penitential meditations.
20717: 
20718: 
20719: 
20720: 
20721: CHAPTER LIII.
20722: 
20723: It is but a shallow haste which concludeth insincerity from what
20724: outsiders call inconsistency—putting a dead mechanism of “ifs” and
20725: “therefores” for the living myriad of hidden suckers whereby the belief
20726: and the conduct are wrought into mutual sustainment.
20727: 
20728: 
20729: Mr. Bulstrode, when he was hoping to acquire a new interest in Lowick,
20730: had naturally had an especial wish that the new clergyman should be one
20731: whom he thoroughly approved; and he believed it to be a chastisement
20732: and admonition directed to his own shortcomings and those of the nation
20733: at large, that just about the time when he came in possession of the
20734: deeds which made him the proprietor of Stone Court, Mr. Farebrother
20735: “read himself” into the quaint little church and preached his first
20736: sermon to the congregation of farmers, laborers, and village artisans.
20737: It was not that Mr. Bulstrode intended to frequent Lowick Church or to
20738: reside at Stone Court for a good while to come: he had bought the
20739: excellent farm and fine homestead simply as a retreat which he might
20740: gradually enlarge as to the land and beautify as to the dwelling, until
20741: it should be conducive to the divine glory that he should enter on it
20742: as a residence, partially withdrawing from his present exertions in the
20743: administration of business, and throwing more conspicuously on the side
20744: of Gospel truth the weight of local landed proprietorship, which
20745: Providence might increase by unforeseen occasions of purchase. A strong
20746: leading in this direction seemed to have been given in the surprising
20747: facility of getting Stone Court, when every one had expected that Mr.
20748: Rigg Featherstone would have clung to it as the Garden of Eden. That
20749: was what poor old Peter himself had expected; having often, in
20750: imagination, looked up through the sods above him, and, unobstructed by
20751: perspective, seen his frog-faced legatee enjoying the fine old place to
20752: the perpetual surprise and disappointment of other survivors.
20753: 
20754: But how little we know what would make paradise for our neighbors! We
20755: judge from our own desires, and our neighbors themselves are not always
20756: open enough even to throw out a hint of theirs. The cool and judicious
20757: Joshua Rigg had not allowed his parent to perceive that Stone Court was
20758: anything less than the chief good in his estimation, and he had
20759: certainly wished to call it his own. But as Warren Hastings looked at
20760: gold and thought of buying Daylesford, so Joshua Rigg looked at Stone
20761: Court and thought of buying gold. He had a very distinct and intense
20762: vision of his chief good, the vigorous greed which he had inherited
20763: having taken a special form by dint of circumstance: and his chief good
20764: was to be a moneychanger. From his earliest employment as an errand-boy
20765: in a seaport, he had looked through the windows of the moneychangers as
20766: other boys look through the windows of the pastry-cooks; the
20767: fascination had wrought itself gradually into a deep special passion;
20768: he meant, when he had property, to do many things, one of them being to
20769: marry a genteel young person; but these were all accidents and joys
20770: that imagination could dispense with. The one joy after which his soul
20771: thirsted was to have a money-changer’s shop on a much-frequented quay,
20772: to have locks all round him of which he held the keys, and to look
20773: sublimely cool as he handled the breeding coins of all nations, while
20774: helpless Cupidity looked at him enviously from the other side of an
20775: iron lattice. The strength of that passion had been a power enabling
20776: him to master all the knowledge necessary to gratify it. And when
20777: others were thinking that he had settled at Stone Court for life,
20778: Joshua himself was thinking that the moment now was not far off when he
20779: should settle on the North Quay with the best appointments in safes and
20780: locks.
20781: 
20782: Enough. We are concerned with looking at Joshua Rigg’s sale of his land
20783: from Mr. Bulstrode’s point of view, and he interpreted it as a cheering
20784: dispensation conveying perhaps a sanction to a purpose which he had for
20785: some time entertained without external encouragement; he interpreted it
20786: thus, but not too confidently, offering up his thanksgiving in guarded
20787: phraseology. His doubts did not arise from the possible relations of
20788: the event to Joshua Rigg’s destiny, which belonged to the unmapped
20789: regions not taken under the providential government, except perhaps in
20790: an imperfect colonial way; but they arose from reflecting that this
20791: dispensation too might be a chastisement for himself, as Mr.
20792: Farebrother’s induction to the living clearly was.
20793: 
20794: This was not what Mr. Bulstrode said to any man for the sake of
20795: deceiving him: it was what he said to himself—it was as genuinely his
20796: mode of explaining events as any theory of yours may be, if you happen
20797: to disagree with him. For the egoism which enters into our theories
20798: does not affect their sincerity; rather, the more our egoism is
20799: satisfied, the more robust is our belief.
20800: 
20801: However, whether for sanction or for chastisement, Mr. Bulstrode,
20802: hardly fifteen months after the death of Peter Featherstone, had become
20803: the proprietor of Stone Court, and what Peter would say “if he were
20804: worthy to know,” had become an inexhaustible and consolatory subject of
20805: conversation to his disappointed relatives. The tables were now turned
20806: on that dear brother departed, and to contemplate the frustration of
20807: his cunning by the superior cunning of things in general was a cud of
20808: delight to Solomon. Mrs. Waule had a melancholy triumph in the proof
20809: that it did not answer to make false Featherstones and cut off the
20810: genuine; and Sister Martha receiving the news in the Chalky Flats said,
20811: “Dear, dear! then the Almighty could have been none so pleased with the
20812: almshouses after all.”
20813: 
20814: Affectionate Mrs. Bulstrode was particularly glad of the advantage
20815: which her husband’s health was likely to get from the purchase of Stone
20816: Court. Few days passed without his riding thither and looking over some
20817: part of the farm with the bailiff, and the evenings were delicious in
20818: that quiet spot, when the new hay-ricks lately set up were sending
20819: forth odors to mingle with the breath of the rich old garden. One
20820: evening, while the sun was still above the horizon and burning in
20821: golden lamps among the great walnut boughs, Mr. Bulstrode was pausing
20822: on horseback outside the front gate waiting for Caleb Garth, who had
20823: met him by appointment to give an opinion on a question of stable
20824: drainage, and was now advising the bailiff in the rick-yard.
20825: 
20826: Mr. Bulstrode was conscious of being in a good spiritual frame and more
20827: than usually serene, under the influence of his innocent recreation. He
20828: was doctrinally convinced that there was a total absence of merit in
20829: himself; but that doctrinal conviction may be held without pain when
20830: the sense of demerit does not take a distinct shape in memory and
20831: revive the tingling of shame or the pang of remorse. Nay, it may be
20832: held with intense satisfaction when the depth of our sinning is but a
20833: measure for the depth of forgiveness, and a clenching proof that we are
20834: peculiar instruments of the divine intention. The memory has as many
20835: moods as the temper, and shifts its scenery like a diorama. At this
20836: moment Mr. Bulstrode felt as if the sunshine were all one with that of
20837: far-off evenings when he was a very young man and used to go out
20838: preaching beyond Highbury. And he would willingly have had that service
20839: of exhortation in prospect now. The texts were there still, and so was
20840: his own facility in expounding them. His brief reverie was interrupted
20841: by the return of Caleb Garth, who also was on horseback, and was just
20842: shaking his bridle before starting, when he exclaimed—
20843: 
20844: “Bless my heart! what’s this fellow in black coming along the lane?
20845: He’s like one of those men one sees about after the races.”
20846: 
20847: Mr. Bulstrode turned his horse and looked along the lane, but made no
20848: reply. The comer was our slight acquaintance Mr. Raffles, whose
20849: appearance presented no other change than such as was due to a suit of
20850: black and a crape hat-band. He was within three yards of the horseman
20851: now, and they could see the flash of recognition in his face as he
20852: whirled his stick upward, looking all the while at Mr. Bulstrode, and
20853: at last exclaiming:—
20854: 
20855: “By Jove, Nick, it’s you! I couldn’t be mistaken, though the
20856: five-and-twenty years have played old Boguy with us both! How are you,
20857: eh? you didn’t expect to see _me_ here. Come, shake us by the hand.” To
20858: say that Mr. Raffles’ manner was rather excited would be only one mode
20859: of saying that it was evening. Caleb Garth could see that there was a
20860: moment of struggle and hesitation in Mr. Bulstrode, but it ended in his
20861: putting out his hand coldly to Raffles and saying—
20862: 
20863: “I did not indeed expect to see you in this remote country place.”
20864: 
20865: “Well, it belongs to a stepson of mine,” said Raffles, adjusting
20866: himself in a swaggering attitude. “I came to see him here before. I’m
20867: not so surprised at seeing you, old fellow, because I picked up a
20868: letter—what you may call a providential thing. It’s uncommonly
20869: fortunate I met you, though; for I don’t care about seeing my stepson:
20870: he’s not affectionate, and his poor mother’s gone now. To tell the
20871: truth, I came out of love to you, Nick: I came to get your address,
20872: for—look here!” Raffles drew a crumpled paper from his pocket.
20873: 
20874: Almost any other man than Caleb Garth might have been tempted to linger
20875: on the spot for the sake of hearing all he could about a man whose
20876: acquaintance with Bulstrode seemed to imply passages in the banker’s
20877: life so unlike anything that was known of him in Middlemarch that they
20878: must have the nature of a secret to pique curiosity. But Caleb was
20879: peculiar: certain human tendencies which are commonly strong were
20880: almost absent from his mind; and one of these was curiosity about
20881: personal affairs. Especially if there was anything discreditable to be
20882: found out concerning another man, Caleb preferred not to know it; and
20883: if he had to tell anybody under him that his evil doings were
20884: discovered, he was more embarrassed than the culprit. He now spurred
20885: his horse, and saying, “I wish you good evening, Mr. Bulstrode; I must
20886: be getting home,” set off at a trot.
20887: 
20888: “You didn’t put your full address to this letter,” Raffles continued.
20889: “That was not like the first-rate man of business you used to be. ‘The
20890: Shrubs,’—they may be anywhere: you live near at hand, eh?—have cut the
20891: London concern altogether—perhaps turned country squire—have a rural
20892: mansion to invite me to. Lord, how many years it is ago! The old lady
20893: must have been dead a pretty long while—gone to glory without the pain
20894: of knowing how poor her daughter was, eh? But, by Jove! you’re very
20895: pale and pasty, Nick. Come, if you’re going home, I’ll walk by your
20896: side.”
20897: 
20898: Mr. Bulstrode’s usual paleness had in fact taken an almost deathly hue.
20899: Five minutes before, the expanse of his life had been submerged in its
20900: evening sunshine which shone backward to its remembered morning: sin
20901: seemed to be a question of doctrine and inward penitence, humiliation
20902: an exercise of the closet, the bearing of his deeds a matter of private
20903: vision adjusted solely by spiritual relations and conceptions of the
20904: divine purposes. And now, as if by some hideous magic, this loud red
20905: figure had risen before him in unmanageable solidity—an incorporate
20906: past which had not entered into his imagination of chastisements. But
20907: Mr. Bulstrode’s thought was busy, and he was not a man to act or speak
20908: rashly.
20909: 
20910: “I was going home,” he said, “but I can defer my ride a little. And you
20911: can, if you please, rest here.”
20912: 
20913: “Thank you,” said Raffles, making a grimace. “I don’t care now about
20914: seeing my stepson. I’d rather go home with you.”
20915: 
20916: “Your stepson, if Mr. Rigg Featherstone was he, is here no longer. I am
20917: master here now.”
20918: 
20919: Raffles opened wide eyes, and gave a long whistle of surprise, before
20920: he said, “Well then, I’ve no objection. I’ve had enough walking from
20921: the coach-road. I never was much of a walker, or rider either. What I
20922: like is a smart vehicle and a spirited cob. I was always a little heavy
20923: in the saddle. What a pleasant surprise it must be to you to see me,
20924: old fellow!” he continued, as they turned towards the house. “You don’t
20925: say so; but you never took your luck heartily—you were always thinking
20926: of improving the occasion—you’d such a gift for improving your luck.”
20927: 
20928: Mr. Raffles seemed greatly to enjoy his own wit, and swung his leg in a
20929: swaggering manner which was rather too much for his companion’s
20930: judicious patience.
20931: 
20932: “If I remember rightly,” Mr. Bulstrode observed, with chill anger, “our
20933: acquaintance many years ago had not the sort of intimacy which you are
20934: now assuming, Mr. Raffles. Any services you desire of me will be the
20935: more readily rendered if you will avoid a tone of familiarity which did
20936: not lie in our former intercourse, and can hardly be warranted by more
20937: than twenty years of separation.”
20938: 
20939: “You don’t like being called Nick? Why, I always called you Nick in my
20940: heart, and though lost to sight, to memory dear. By Jove! my feelings
20941: have ripened for you like fine old cognac. I hope you’ve got some in
20942: the house now. Josh filled my flask well the last time.”
20943: 
20944: Mr. Bulstrode had not yet fully learned that even the desire for cognac
20945: was not stronger in Raffles than the desire to torment, and that a hint
20946: of annoyance always served him as a fresh cue. But it was at least
20947: clear that further objection was useless, and Mr. Bulstrode, in giving
20948: orders to the housekeeper for the accommodation of the guest, had a
20949: resolute air of quietude.
20950: 
20951: There was the comfort of thinking that this housekeeper had been in the
20952: service of Rigg also, and might accept the idea that Mr. Bulstrode
20953: entertained Raffles merely as a friend of her former master.
20954: 
20955: When there was food and drink spread before his visitor in the
20956: wainscoted parlor, and no witness in the room, Mr. Bulstrode said—
20957: 
20958: “Your habits and mine are so different, Mr. Raffles, that we can hardly
20959: enjoy each other’s society. The wisest plan for both of us will
20960: therefore be to part as soon as possible. Since you say that you wished
20961: to meet me, you probably considered that you had some business to
20962: transact with me. But under the circumstances I will invite you to
20963: remain here for the night, and I will myself ride over here early
20964: to-morrow morning—before breakfast, in fact—when I can receive any
20965: communication you have to make to me.”
20966: 
20967: “With all my heart,” said Raffles; “this is a comfortable place—a
20968: little dull for a continuance; but I can put up with it for a night,
20969: with this good liquor and the prospect of seeing you again in the
20970: morning. You’re a much better host than my stepson was; but Josh owed
20971: me a bit of a grudge for marrying his mother; and between you and me
20972: there was never anything but kindness.”
20973: 
20974: Mr. Bulstrode, hoping that the peculiar mixture of joviality and
20975: sneering in Raffles’ manner was a good deal the effect of drink, had
20976: determined to wait till he was quite sober before he spent more words
20977: upon him. But he rode home with a terribly lucid vision of the
20978: difficulty there would be in arranging any result that could be
20979: permanently counted on with this man. It was inevitable that he should
20980: wish to get rid of John Raffles, though his reappearance could not be
20981: regarded as lying outside the divine plan. The spirit of evil might
20982: have sent him to threaten Mr. Bulstrode’s subversion as an instrument
20983: of good; but the threat must have been permitted, and was a
20984: chastisement of a new kind. It was an hour of anguish for him very
20985: different from the hours in which his struggle had been securely
20986: private, and which had ended with a sense that his secret misdeeds were
20987: pardoned and his services accepted. Those misdeeds even when
20988: committed—had they not been half sanctified by the singleness of his
20989: desire to devote himself and all he possessed to the furtherance of the
20990: divine scheme? And was he after all to become a mere stone of stumbling
20991: and a rock of offence? For who would understand the work within him?
20992: Who would not, when there was the pretext of casting disgrace upon him,
20993: confound his whole life and the truths he had espoused, in one heap of
20994: obloquy?
20995: 
20996: In his closest meditations the life-long habit of Mr. Bulstrode’s mind
20997: clad his most egoistic terrors in doctrinal references to superhuman
20998: ends. But even while we are talking and meditating about the earth’s
20999: orbit and the solar system, what we feel and adjust our movements to is
21000: the stable earth and the changing day. And now within all the automatic
21001: succession of theoretic phrases—distinct and inmost as the shiver and
21002: the ache of oncoming fever when we are discussing abstract pain, was
21003: the forecast of disgrace in the presence of his neighbors and of his
21004: own wife. For the pain, as well as the public estimate of disgrace,
21005: depends on the amount of previous profession. To men who only aim at
21006: escaping felony, nothing short of the prisoner’s dock is disgrace. But
21007: Mr. Bulstrode had aimed at being an eminent Christian.
21008: 
21009: It was not more than half-past seven in the morning when he again
21010: reached Stone Court. The fine old place never looked more like a
21011: delightful home than at that moment; the great white lilies were in
21012: flower, the nasturtiums, their pretty leaves all silvered with dew,
21013: were running away over the low stone wall; the very noises all around
21014: had a heart of peace within them. But everything was spoiled for the
21015: owner as he walked on the gravel in front and awaited the descent of
21016: Mr. Raffles, with whom he was condemned to breakfast.
21017: 
21018: It was not long before they were seated together in the wainscoted
21019: parlor over their tea and toast, which was as much as Raffles cared to
21020: take at that early hour. The difference between his morning and evening
21021: self was not so great as his companion had imagined that it might be;
21022: the delight in tormenting was perhaps even the stronger because his
21023: spirits were rather less highly pitched. Certainly his manners seemed
21024: more disagreeable by the morning light.
21025: 
21026: “As I have little time to spare, Mr. Raffles,” said the banker, who
21027: could hardly do more than sip his tea and break his toast without
21028: eating it, “I shall be obliged if you will mention at once the ground
21029: on which you wished to meet with me. I presume that you have a home
21030: elsewhere and will be glad to return to it.”
21031: 
21032: “Why, if a man has got any heart, doesn’t he want to see an old friend,
21033: Nick?—I must call you Nick—we always did call you young Nick when we
21034: knew you meant to marry the old widow. Some said you had a handsome
21035: family likeness to old Nick, but that was your mother’s fault, calling
21036: you Nicholas. Aren’t you glad to see me again? I expected an invite to
21037: stay with you at some pretty place. My own establishment is broken up
21038: now my wife’s dead. I’ve no particular attachment to any spot; I would
21039: as soon settle hereabout as anywhere.”
21040: 
21041: “May I ask why you returned from America? I considered that the strong
21042: wish you expressed to go there, when an adequate sum was furnished, was
21043: tantamount to an engagement that you would remain there for life.”
21044: 
21045: “Never knew that a wish to go to a place was the same thing as a wish
21046: to stay. But I did stay a matter of ten years; it didn’t suit me to
21047: stay any longer. And I’m not going again, Nick.” Here Mr. Raffles
21048: winked slowly as he looked at Mr. Bulstrode.
21049: 
21050: “Do you wish to be settled in any business? What is your calling now?”
21051: 
21052: “Thank you, my calling is to enjoy myself as much as I can. I don’t
21053: care about working any more. If I did anything it would be a little
21054: travelling in the tobacco line—or something of that sort, which takes a
21055: man into agreeable company. But not without an independence to fall
21056: back upon. That’s what I want: I’m not so strong as I was, Nick, though
21057: I’ve got more color than you. I want an independence.”
21058: 
21059: “That could be supplied to you, if you would engage to keep at a
21060: distance,” said Mr. Bulstrode, perhaps with a little too much eagerness
21061: in his undertone.
21062: 
21063: “That must be as it suits my convenience,” said Raffles coolly. “I see
21064: no reason why I shouldn’t make a few acquaintances hereabout. I’m not
21065: ashamed of myself as company for anybody. I dropped my portmanteau at
21066: the turnpike when I got down—change of linen—genuine—honor bright—more
21067: than fronts and wristbands; and with this suit of mourning, straps and
21068: everything, I should do you credit among the nobs here.” Mr. Raffles
21069: had pushed away his chair and looked down at himself, particularly at
21070: his straps. His chief intention was to annoy Bulstrode, but he really
21071: thought that his appearance now would produce a good effect, and that
21072: he was not only handsome and witty, but clad in a mourning style which
21073: implied solid connections.
21074: 
21075: “If you intend to rely on me in any way, Mr. Raffles,” said Bulstrode,
21076: after a moment’s pause, “you will expect to meet my wishes.”
21077: 
21078: “Ah, to be sure,” said Raffles, with a mocking cordiality. “Didn’t I
21079: always do it? Lord, you made a pretty thing out of me, and I got but
21080: little. I’ve often thought since, I might have done better by telling
21081: the old woman that I’d found her daughter and her grandchild: it would
21082: have suited my feelings better; I’ve got a soft place in my heart. But
21083: you’ve buried the old lady by this time, I suppose—it’s all one to her
21084: now. And you’ve got your fortune out of that profitable business which
21085: had such a blessing on it. You’ve taken to being a nob, buying land,
21086: being a country bashaw. Still in the Dissenting line, eh? Still godly?
21087: Or taken to the Church as more genteel?”
21088: 
21089: This time Mr. Raffles’ slow wink and slight protrusion of his tongue
21090: was worse than a nightmare, because it held the certitude that it was
21091: not a nightmare, but a waking misery. Mr. Bulstrode felt a shuddering
21092: nausea, and did not speak, but was considering diligently whether he
21093: should not leave Raffles to do as he would, and simply defy him as a
21094: slanderer. The man would soon show himself disreputable enough to make
21095: people disbelieve him. “But not when he tells any ugly-looking truth
21096: about _you_,” said discerning consciousness. And again: it seemed no
21097: wrong to keep Raffles at a distance, but Mr. Bulstrode shrank from the
21098: direct falsehood of denying true statements. It was one thing to look
21099: back on forgiven sins, nay, to explain questionable conformity to lax
21100: customs, and another to enter deliberately on the necessity of
21101: falsehood.
21102: 
21103: But since Bulstrode did not speak, Raffles ran on, by way of using time
21104: to the utmost.
21105: 
21106: “I’ve not had such fine luck as you, by Jove! Things went confoundedly
21107: with me in New York; those Yankees are cool hands, and a man of
21108: gentlemanly feelings has no chance with them. I married when I came
21109: back—a nice woman in the tobacco trade—very fond of me—but the trade
21110: was restricted, as we say. She had been settled there a good many years
21111: by a friend; but there was a son too much in the case. Josh and I never
21112: hit it off. However, I made the most of the position, and I’ve always
21113: taken my glass in good company. It’s been all on the square with me;
21114: I’m as open as the day. You won’t take it ill of me that I didn’t look
21115: you up before. I’ve got a complaint that makes me a little dilatory. I
21116: thought you were trading and praying away in London still, and didn’t
21117: find you there. But you see I was sent to you, Nick—perhaps for a
21118: blessing to both of us.”
21119: 
21120: Mr. Raffles ended with a jocose snuffle: no man felt his intellect more
21121: superior to religious cant. And if the cunning which calculates on the
21122: meanest feelings in men could be called intellect, he had his share,
21123: for under the blurting rallying tone with which he spoke to Bulstrode,
21124: there was an evident selection of statements, as if they had been so
21125: many moves at chess. Meanwhile Bulstrode had determined on his move,
21126: and he said, with gathered resolution—
21127: 
21128: “You will do well to reflect, Mr. Raffles, that it is possible for a
21129: man to overreach himself in the effort to secure undue advantage.
21130: Although I am not in any way bound to you, I am willing to supply you
21131: with a regular annuity—in quarterly payments—so long as you fulfil a
21132: promise to remain at a distance from this neighborhood. It is in your
21133: power to choose. If you insist on remaining here, even for a short
21134: time, you will get nothing from me. I shall decline to know you.”
21135: 
21136: “Ha, ha!” said Raffles, with an affected explosion, “that reminds me of
21137: a droll dog of a thief who declined to know the constable.”
21138: 
21139: “Your allusions are lost on me sir,” said Bulstrode, with white heat;
21140: “the law has no hold on me either through your agency or any other.”
21141: 
21142: “You can’t understand a joke, my good fellow. I only meant that I
21143: should never decline to know you. But let us be serious. Your quarterly
21144: payment won’t quite suit me. I like my freedom.”
21145: 
21146: Here Raffles rose and stalked once or twice up and down the room,
21147: swinging his leg, and assuming an air of masterly meditation. At last
21148: he stopped opposite Bulstrode, and said, “I’ll tell you what! Give us a
21149: couple of hundreds—come, that’s modest—and I’ll go away—honor
21150: bright!—pick up my portmanteau and go away. But I shall not give up my
21151: liberty for a dirty annuity. I shall come and go where I like. Perhaps
21152: it may suit me to stay away, and correspond with a friend; perhaps not.
21153: Have you the money with you?”
21154: 
21155: “No, I have one hundred,” said Bulstrode, feeling the immediate
21156: riddance too great a relief to be rejected on the ground of future
21157: uncertainties. “I will forward you the other if you will mention an
21158: address.”
21159: 
21160: “No, I’ll wait here till you bring it,” said Raffles. “I’ll take a
21161: stroll and have a snack, and you’ll be back by that time.”
21162: 
21163: Mr. Bulstrode’s sickly body, shattered by the agitations he had gone
21164: through since the last evening, made him feel abjectly in the power of
21165: this loud invulnerable man. At that moment he snatched at a temporary
21166: repose to be won on any terms. He was rising to do what Raffles
21167: suggested, when the latter said, lifting up his finger as if with a
21168: sudden recollection—
21169: 
21170: “I did have another look after Sarah again, though I didn’t tell you;
21171: I’d a tender conscience about that pretty young woman. I didn’t find
21172: her, but I found out her husband’s name, and I made a note of it. But
21173: hang it, I lost my pocketbook. However, if I heard it, I should know it
21174: again. I’ve got my faculties as if I was in my prime, but names wear
21175: out, by Jove! Sometimes I’m no better than a confounded tax-paper
21176: before the names are filled in. However, if I hear of her and her
21177: family, you shall know, Nick. You’d like to do something for her, now
21178: she’s your step-daughter.”
21179: 
21180: “Doubtless,” said Mr. Bulstrode, with the usual steady look of his
21181: light-gray eyes; “though that might reduce my power of assisting you.”
21182: 
21183: As he walked out of the room, Raffles winked slowly at his back, and
21184: then turned towards the window to watch the banker riding
21185: away—virtually at his command. His lips first curled with a smile and
21186: then opened with a short triumphant laugh.
21187: 
21188: “But what the deuce was the name?” he presently said, half aloud,
21189: scratching his head, and wrinkling his brows horizontally. He had not
21190: really cared or thought about this point of forgetfulness until it
21191: occurred to him in his invention of annoyances for Bulstrode.
21192: 
21193: “It began with L; it was almost all l’s I fancy,” he went on, with a
21194: sense that he was getting hold of the slippery name. But the hold was
21195: too slight, and he soon got tired of this mental chase; for few men
21196: were more impatient of private occupation or more in need of making
21197: themselves continually heard than Mr. Raffles. He preferred using his
21198: time in pleasant conversation with the bailiff and the housekeeper,
21199: from whom he gathered as much as he wanted to know about Mr.
21200: Bulstrode’s position in Middlemarch.
21201: 
21202: After all, however, there was a dull space of time which needed
21203: relieving with bread and cheese and ale, and when he was seated alone
21204: with these resources in the wainscoted parlor, he suddenly slapped his
21205: knee, and exclaimed, “Ladislaw!” That action of memory which he had
21206: tried to set going, and had abandoned in despair, had suddenly
21207: completed itself without conscious effort—a common experience,
21208: agreeable as a completed sneeze, even if the name remembered is of no
21209: value. Raffles immediately took out his pocket-book, and wrote down the
21210: name, not because he expected to use it, but merely for the sake of not
21211: being at a loss if he ever did happen to want it. He was not going to
21212: tell Bulstrode: there was no actual good in telling, and to a mind like
21213: that of Mr. Raffles there is always probable good in a secret.
21214: 
21215: He was satisfied with his present success, and by three o’clock that
21216: day he had taken up his portmanteau at the turnpike and mounted the
21217: coach, relieving Mr. Bulstrode’s eyes of an ugly black spot on the
21218: landscape at Stone Court, but not relieving him of the dread that the
21219: black spot might reappear and become inseparable even from the vision
21220: of his hearth.

21231: CHAPTER LIV.
21232: 
21233: “Negli occhi porta la mia donna Amore;
21234: Per che si fa gentil ciò ch’ella mira:
21235: Ov’ella passa, ogni uom ver lei si gira,
21236: E cui saluta fa tremar lo core.
21237: 
21238: Sicchè, bassando il viso, tutto smore,
21239: E d’ogni suo difetto allor sospira:
21240: Fuggon dinanzi a lei Superbia ed Ira:
21241: Aiutatemi, donne, a farle onore.
21242: 
21243: Ogni dolcezza, ogni pensiero umile
21244: Nasce nel core a chi parlar la sente;
21245: Ond’è beato chi prima la vide.
21246: Quel ch’ella par quand’ un poco sorride,
21247: Non si può dicer, nè tener a mente,
21248: Si è nuovo miracolo gentile.”
21249: —DANTE: _La Vita Nuova_.
21250: 
21251: 
21252: By that delightful morning when the hay-ricks at Stone Court were
21253: scenting the air quite impartially, as if Mr. Raffles had been a guest
21254: worthy of finest incense, Dorothea had again taken up her abode at
21255: Lowick Manor. After three months Freshitt had become rather oppressive:
21256: to sit like a model for Saint Catherine looking rapturously at Celia’s
21257: baby would not do for many hours in the day, and to remain in that
21258: momentous babe’s presence with persistent disregard was a course that
21259: could not have been tolerated in a childless sister. Dorothea would
21260: have been capable of carrying baby joyfully for a mile if there had
21261: been need, and of loving it the more tenderly for that labor; but to an
21262: aunt who does not recognize her infant nephew as Bouddha, and has
21263: nothing to do for him but to admire, his behavior is apt to appear
21264: monotonous, and the interest of watching him exhaustible. This
21265: possibility was quite hidden from Celia, who felt that Dorothea’s
21266: childless widowhood fell in quite prettily with the birth of little
21267: Arthur (baby was named after Mr. Brooke).
21268: 
21269: “Dodo is just the creature not to mind about having anything of her
21270: own—children or anything!” said Celia to her husband. “And if she had
21271: had a baby, it never could have been such a dear as Arthur. Could it,
21272: James?
21273: 
21274: “Not if it had been like Casaubon,” said Sir James, conscious of some
21275: indirectness in his answer, and of holding a strictly private opinion
21276: as to the perfections of his first-born.
21277: 
21278: “No! just imagine! Really it was a mercy,” said Celia; “and I think it
21279: is very nice for Dodo to be a widow. She can be just as fond of our
21280: baby as if it were her own, and she can have as many notions of her own
21281: as she likes.”
21282: 
21283: “It is a pity she was not a queen,” said the devout Sir James.
21284: 
21285: “But what should we have been then? We must have been something else,”
21286: said Celia, objecting to so laborious a flight of imagination. “I like
21287: her better as she is.”
21288: 
21289: Hence, when she found that Dorothea was making arrangements for her
21290: final departure to Lowick, Celia raised her eyebrows with
21291: disappointment, and in her quiet unemphatic way shot a needle-arrow of
21292: sarcasm.
21293: 
21294: “What will you do at Lowick, Dodo? You say yourself there is nothing to
21295: be done there: everybody is so clean and well off, it makes you quite
21296: melancholy. And here you have been so happy going all about Tipton with
21297: Mr. Garth into the worst backyards. And now uncle is abroad, you and
21298: Mr. Garth can have it all your own way; and I am sure James does
21299: everything you tell him.”
21300: 
21301: “I shall often come here, and I shall see how baby grows all the
21302: better,” said Dorothea.
21303: 
21304: “But you will never see him washed,” said Celia; “and that is quite the
21305: best part of the day.” She was almost pouting: it did seem to her very
21306: hard in Dodo to go away from the baby when she might stay.
21307: 
21308: “Dear Kitty, I will come and stay all night on purpose,” said Dorothea;
21309: “but I want to be alone now, and in my own home. I wish to know the
21310: Farebrothers better, and to talk to Mr. Farebrother about what there is
21311: to be done in Middlemarch.”
21312: 
21313: Dorothea’s native strength of will was no longer all converted into
21314: resolute submission. She had a great yearning to be at Lowick, and was
21315: simply determined to go, not feeling bound to tell all her reasons. But
21316: every one around her disapproved. Sir James was much pained, and
21317: offered that they should all migrate to Cheltenham for a few months
21318: with the sacred ark, otherwise called a cradle: at that period a man
21319: could hardly know what to propose if Cheltenham were rejected.
21320: 
21321: The Dowager Lady Chettam, just returned from a visit to her daughter in
21322: town, wished, at least, that Mrs. Vigo should be written to, and
21323: invited to accept the office of companion to Mrs. Casaubon: it was not
21324: credible that Dorothea as a young widow would think of living alone in
21325: the house at Lowick. Mrs. Vigo had been reader and secretary to royal
21326: personages, and in point of knowledge and sentiments even Dorothea
21327: could have nothing to object to her.
21328: 
21329: Mrs. Cadwallader said, privately, “You will certainly go mad in that
21330: house alone, my dear. You will see visions. We have all got to exert
21331: ourselves a little to keep sane, and call things by the same names as
21332: other people call them by. To be sure, for younger sons and women who
21333: have no money, it is a sort of provision to go mad: they are taken care
21334: of then. But you must not run into that. I dare say you are a little
21335: bored here with our good dowager; but think what a bore you might
21336: become yourself to your fellow-creatures if you were always playing
21337: tragedy queen and taking things sublimely. Sitting alone in that
21338: library at Lowick you may fancy yourself ruling the weather; you must
21339: get a few people round you who wouldn’t believe you if you told them.
21340: That is a good lowering medicine.”
21341: 
21342: “I never called everything by the same name that all the people about
21343: me did,” said Dorothea, stoutly.
21344: 
21345: “But I suppose you have found out your mistake, my dear,” said Mrs.
21346: Cadwallader, “and that is a proof of sanity.”
21347: 
21348: Dorothea was aware of the sting, but it did not hurt her. “No,” she
21349: said, “I still think that the greater part of the world is mistaken
21350: about many things. Surely one may be sane and yet think so, since the
21351: greater part of the world has often had to come round from its
21352: opinion.”
21353: 
21354: Mrs. Cadwallader said no more on that point to Dorothea, but to her
21355: husband she remarked, “It will be well for her to marry again as soon
21356: as it is proper, if one could get her among the right people. Of course
21357: the Chettams would not wish it. But I see clearly a husband is the best
21358: thing to keep her in order. If we were not so poor I would invite Lord
21359: Triton. He will be marquis some day, and there is no denying that she
21360: would make a good marchioness: she looks handsomer than ever in her
21361: mourning.”
21362: 
21363: “My dear Elinor, do let the poor woman alone. Such contrivances are of
21364: no use,” said the easy Rector.
21365: 
21366: “No use? How are matches made, except by bringing men and women
21367: together? And it is a shame that her uncle should have run away and
21368: shut up the Grange just now. There ought to be plenty of eligible
21369: matches invited to Freshitt and the Grange. Lord Triton is precisely
21370: the man: full of plans for making the people happy in a soft-headed
21371: sort of way. That would just suit Mrs. Casaubon.”
21372: 
21373: “Let Mrs. Casaubon choose for herself, Elinor.”
21374: 
21375: “That is the nonsense you wise men talk! How can she choose if she has
21376: no variety to choose from? A woman’s choice usually means taking the
21377: only man she can get. Mark my words, Humphrey. If her friends don’t
21378: exert themselves, there will be a worse business than the Casaubon
21379: business yet.”
21380: 
21381: “For heaven’s sake don’t touch on that topic, Elinor! It is a very sore
21382: point with Sir James. He would be deeply offended if you entered on it
21383: to him unnecessarily.”
21384: 
21385: “I have never entered on it,” said Mrs Cadwallader, opening her hands.
21386: “Celia told me all about the will at the beginning, without any asking
21387: of mine.”
21388: 
21389: “Yes, yes; but they want the thing hushed up, and I understand that the
21390: young fellow is going out of the neighborhood.”
21391: 
21392: Mrs. Cadwallader said nothing, but gave her husband three significant
21393: nods, with a very sarcastic expression in her dark eyes.
21394: 
21395: Dorothea quietly persisted in spite of remonstrance and persuasion. So
21396: by the end of June the shutters were all opened at Lowick Manor, and
21397: the morning gazed calmly into the library, shining on the rows of
21398: note-books as it shines on the weary waste planted with huge stones,
21399: the mute memorial of a forgotten faith; and the evening laden with
21400: roses entered silently into the blue-green boudoir where Dorothea chose
21401: oftenest to sit. At first she walked into every room, questioning the
21402: eighteen months of her married life, and carrying on her thoughts as if
21403: they were a speech to be heard by her husband. Then, she lingered in
21404: the library and could not be at rest till she had carefully ranged all
21405: the note-books as she imagined that he would wish to see them, in
21406: orderly sequence. The pity which had been the restraining compelling
21407: motive in her life with him still clung about his image, even while she
21408: remonstrated with him in indignant thought and told him that he was
21409: unjust. One little act of hers may perhaps be smiled at as
21410: superstitious. The Synoptical Tabulation for the use of Mrs. Casaubon,
21411: she carefully enclosed and sealed, writing within the envelope, “I
21412: could not use it. Do you not see now that I could not submit my soul to
21413: yours, by working hopelessly at what I have no belief in—Dorothea?”
21414: Then she deposited the paper in her own desk.
21415: 
21416: That silent colloquy was perhaps only the more earnest because
21417: underneath and through it all there was always the deep longing which
21418: had really determined her to come to Lowick. The longing was to see
21419: Will Ladislaw. She did not know any good that could come of their
21420: meeting: she was helpless; her hands had been tied from making up to
21421: him for any unfairness in his lot. But her soul thirsted to see him.
21422: How could it be otherwise? If a princess in the days of enchantment had
21423: seen a four-footed creature from among those which live in herds come
21424: to her once and again with a human gaze which rested upon her with
21425: choice and beseeching, what would she think of in her journeying, what
21426: would she look for when the herds passed her? Surely for the gaze which
21427: had found her, and which she would know again. Life would be no better
21428: than candle-light tinsel and daylight rubbish if our spirits were not
21429: touched by what has been, to issues of longing and constancy. It was
21430: true that Dorothea wanted to know the Farebrothers better, and
21431: especially to talk to the new rector, but also true that remembering
21432: what Lydgate had told her about Will Ladislaw and little Miss Noble,
21433: she counted on Will’s coming to Lowick to see the Farebrother family.
21434: The very first Sunday, _before_ she entered the church, she saw him as
21435: she had seen him the last time she was there, alone in the clergyman’s
21436: pew; but _when_ she entered his figure was gone.
21437: 
21438: In the week-days when she went to see the ladies at the Rectory, she
21439: listened in vain for some word that they might let fall about Will; but
21440: it seemed to her that Mrs. Farebrother talked of every one else in the
21441: neighborhood and out of it.
21442: 
21443: “Probably some of Mr. Farebrother’s Middlemarch hearers may follow him
21444: to Lowick sometimes. Do you not think so?” said Dorothea, rather
21445: despising herself for having a secret motive in asking the question.
21446: 
21447: “If they are wise they will, Mrs. Casaubon,” said the old lady. “I see
21448: that you set a right value on my son’s preaching. His grandfather on my
21449: side was an excellent clergyman, but his father was in the law:—most
21450: exemplary and honest nevertheless, which is a reason for our never
21451: being rich. They say Fortune is a woman and capricious. But sometimes
21452: she is a good woman and gives to those who merit, which has been the
21453: case with you, Mrs. Casaubon, who have given a living to my son.”
21454: 
21455: Mrs. Farebrother recurred to her knitting with a dignified satisfaction
21456: in her neat little effort at oratory, but this was not what Dorothea
21457: wanted to hear. Poor thing! she did not even know whether Will Ladislaw
21458: was still at Middlemarch, and there was no one whom she dared to ask,
21459: unless it were Lydgate. But just now she could not see Lydgate without
21460: sending for him or going to seek him. Perhaps Will Ladislaw, having
21461: heard of that strange ban against him left by Mr. Casaubon, had felt it
21462: better that he and she should not meet again, and perhaps she was wrong
21463: to wish for a meeting that others might find many good reasons against.
21464: Still “I do wish it” came at the end of those wise reflections as
21465: naturally as a sob after holding the breath. And the meeting did
21466: happen, but in a formal way quite unexpected by her.
21467: 
21468: One morning, about eleven, Dorothea was seated in her boudoir with a
21469: map of the land attached to the manor and other papers before her,
21470: which were to help her in making an exact statement for herself of her
21471: income and affairs. She had not yet applied herself to her work, but
21472: was seated with her hands folded on her lap, looking out along the
21473: avenue of limes to the distant fields. Every leaf was at rest in the
21474: sunshine, the familiar scene was changeless, and seemed to represent
21475: the prospect of her life, full of motiveless ease—motiveless, if her
21476: own energy could not seek out reasons for ardent action. The widow’s
21477: cap of those times made an oval frame for the face, and had a crown
21478: standing up; the dress was an experiment in the utmost laying on of
21479: crape; but this heavy solemnity of clothing made her face look all the
21480: younger, with its recovered bloom, and the sweet, inquiring candor of
21481: her eyes.
21482: 
21483: Her reverie was broken by Tantripp, who came to say that Mr. Ladislaw
21484: was below, and begged permission to see Madam if it were not too early.
21485: 
21486: “I will see him,” said Dorothea, rising immediately. “Let him be shown
21487: into the drawing-room.”
21488: 
21489: The drawing-room was the most neutral room in the house to her—the one
21490: least associated with the trials of her married life: the damask
21491: matched the wood-work, which was all white and gold; there were two
21492: tall mirrors and tables with nothing on them—in brief, it was a room
21493: where you had no reason for sitting in one place rather than in
21494: another. It was below the boudoir, and had also a bow-window looking
21495: out on the avenue. But when Pratt showed Will Ladislaw into it the
21496: window was open; and a winged visitor, buzzing in and out now and then
21497: without minding the furniture, made the room look less formal and
21498: uninhabited.
21499: 
21500: “Glad to see you here again, sir,” said Pratt, lingering to adjust a
21501: blind.
21502: 
21503: “I am only come to say good-by, Pratt,” said Will, who wished even the
21504: butler to know that he was too proud to hang about Mrs. Casaubon now
21505: she was a rich widow.
21506: 
21507: “Very sorry to hear it, sir,” said Pratt, retiring. Of course, as a
21508: servant who was to be told nothing, he knew the fact of which Ladislaw
21509: was still ignorant, and had drawn his inferences; indeed, had not
21510: differed from his betrothed Tantripp when she said, “Your master was as
21511: jealous as a fiend—and no reason. Madam would look higher than Mr.
21512: Ladislaw, else I don’t know her. Mrs. Cadwallader’s maid says there’s a
21513: lord coming who is to marry her when the mourning’s over.”
21514: 
21515: There were not many moments for Will to walk about with his hat in his
21516: hand before Dorothea entered. The meeting was very different from that
21517: first meeting in Rome when Will had been embarrassed and Dorothea calm.
21518: This time he felt miserable but determined, while she was in a state of
21519: agitation which could not be hidden. Just outside the door she had felt
21520: that this longed-for meeting was after all too difficult, and when she
21521: saw Will advancing towards her, the deep blush which was rare in her
21522: came with painful suddenness. Neither of them knew how it was, but
21523: neither of them spoke. She gave her hand for a moment, and then they
21524: went to sit down near the window, she on one settee and he on another
21525: opposite. Will was peculiarly uneasy: it seemed to him not like
21526: Dorothea that the mere fact of her being a widow should cause such a
21527: change in her manner of receiving him; and he knew of no other
21528: condition which could have affected their previous relation to each
21529: other—except that, as his imagination at once told him, her friends
21530: might have been poisoning her mind with their suspicions of him.
21531: 
21532: “I hope I have not presumed too much in calling,” said Will; “I could
21533: not bear to leave the neighborhood and begin a new life without seeing
21534: you to say good-by.”
21535: 
21536: “Presumed? Surely not. I should have thought it unkind if you had not
21537: wished to see me,” said Dorothea, her habit of speaking with perfect
21538: genuineness asserting itself through all her uncertainty and agitation.
21539: “Are you going away immediately?”
21540: 
21541: “Very soon, I think. I intend to go to town and eat my dinners as a
21542: barrister, since, they say, that is the preparation for all public
21543: business. There will be a great deal of political work to be done
21544: by-and-by, and I mean to try and do some of it. Other men have managed
21545: to win an honorable position for themselves without family or money.”
21546: 
21547: “And that will make it all the more honorable,” said Dorothea,
21548: ardently. “Besides, you have so many talents. I have heard from my
21549: uncle how well you speak in public, so that every one is sorry when you
21550: leave off, and how clearly you can explain things. And you care that
21551: justice should be done to every one. I am so glad. When we were in
21552: Rome, I thought you only cared for poetry and art, and the things that
21553: adorn life for us who are well off. But now I know you think about the
21554: rest of the world.”
21555: 
21556: While she was speaking Dorothea had lost her personal embarrassment,
21557: and had become like her former self. She looked at Will with a direct
21558: glance, full of delighted confidence.
21559: 
21560: “You approve of my going away for years, then, and never coming here
21561: again till I have made myself of some mark in the world?” said Will,
21562: trying hard to reconcile the utmost pride with the utmost effort to get
21563: an expression of strong feeling from Dorothea.
21564: 
21565: She was not aware how long it was before she answered. She had turned
21566: her head and was looking out of the window on the rose-bushes, which
21567: seemed to have in them the summers of all the years when Will would be
21568: away. This was not judicious behavior. But Dorothea never thought of
21569: studying her manners: she thought only of bowing to a sad necessity
21570: which divided her from Will. Those first words of his about his
21571: intentions had seemed to make everything clear to her: he knew, she
21572: supposed, all about Mr. Casaubon’s final conduct in relation to him,
21573: and it had come to him with the same sort of shock as to herself. He
21574: had never felt more than friendship for her—had never had anything in
21575: his mind to justify what she felt to be her husband’s outrage on the
21576: feelings of both: and that friendship he still felt. Something which
21577: may be called an inward silent sob had gone on in Dorothea before she
21578: said with a pure voice, just trembling in the last words as if only
21579: from its liquid flexibility—
21580: 
21581: “Yes, it must be right for you to do as you say. I shall be very happy
21582: when I hear that you have made your value felt. But you must have
21583: patience. It will perhaps be a long while.”
21584: 
21585: Will never quite knew how it was that he saved himself from falling
21586: down at her feet, when the “long while” came forth with its gentle
21587: tremor. He used to say that the horrible hue and surface of her crape
21588: dress was most likely the sufficient controlling force. He sat still,
21589: however, and only said—
21590: 
21591: “I shall never hear from you. And you will forget all about me.”
21592: 
21593: “No,” said Dorothea, “I shall never forget you. I have never forgotten
21594: any one whom I once knew. My life has never been crowded, and seems not
21595: likely to be so. And I have a great deal of space for memory at Lowick,
21596: haven’t I?” She smiled.
21597: 
21598: “Good God!” Will burst out passionately, rising, with his hat still in
21599: his hand, and walking away to a marble table, where he suddenly turned
21600: and leaned his back against it. The blood had mounted to his face and
21601: neck, and he looked almost angry. It had seemed to him as if they were
21602: like two creatures slowly turning to marble in each other’s presence,
21603: while their hearts were conscious and their eyes were yearning. But
21604: there was no help for it. It should never be true of him that in this
21605: meeting to which he had come with bitter resolution he had ended by a
21606: confession which might be interpreted into asking for her fortune.
21607: Moreover, it was actually true that he was fearful of the effect which
21608: such confessions might have on Dorothea herself.
21609: 
21610: She looked at him from that distance in some trouble, imagining that
21611: there might have been an offence in her words. But all the while there
21612: was a current of thought in her about his probable want of money, and
21613: the impossibility of her helping him. If her uncle had been at home,
21614: something might have been done through him! It was this preoccupation
21615: with the hardship of Will’s wanting money, while she had what ought to
21616: have been his share, which led her to say, seeing that he remained
21617: silent and looked away from her—
21618: 
21619: “I wonder whether you would like to have that miniature which hangs
21620: up-stairs—I mean that beautiful miniature of your grandmother. I think
21621: it is not right for me to keep it, if you would wish to have it. It is
21622: wonderfully like you.”
21623: 
21624: “You are very good,” said Will, irritably. “No; I don’t mind about it.
21625: It is not very consoling to have one’s own likeness. It would be more
21626: consoling if others wanted to have it.”
21627: 
21628: “I thought you would like to cherish her memory—I thought—” Dorothea
21629: broke off an instant, her imagination suddenly warning her away from
21630: Aunt Julia’s history—“you would surely like to have the miniature as a
21631: family memorial.”
21632: 
21633: “Why should I have that, when I have nothing else! A man with only a
21634: portmanteau for his stowage must keep his memorials in his head.”
21635: 
21636: Will spoke at random: he was merely venting his petulance; it was a
21637: little too exasperating to have his grandmother’s portrait offered him
21638: at that moment. But to Dorothea’s feeling his words had a peculiar
21639: sting. She rose and said with a touch of indignation as well as
21640: hauteur—
21641: 
21642: “You are much the happier of us two, Mr. Ladislaw, to have nothing.”
21643: 
21644: Will was startled. Whatever the words might be, the tone seemed like a
21645: dismissal; and quitting his leaning posture, he walked a little way
21646: towards her. Their eyes met, but with a strange questioning gravity.
21647: Something was keeping their minds aloof, and each was left to
21648: conjecture what was in the other. Will had really never thought of
21649: himself as having a claim of inheritance on the property which was held
21650: by Dorothea, and would have required a narrative to make him understand
21651: her present feeling.
21652: 
21653: “I never felt it a misfortune to have nothing till now,” he said. “But
21654: poverty may be as bad as leprosy, if it divides us from what we most
21655: care for.”
21656: 
21657: The words cut Dorothea to the heart, and made her relent. She answered
21658: in a tone of sad fellowship.
21659: 
21660: “Sorrow comes in so many ways. Two years ago I had no notion of that—I
21661: mean of the unexpected way in which trouble comes, and ties our hands,
21662: and makes us silent when we long to speak. I used to despise women a
21663: little for not shaping their lives more, and doing better things. I was
21664: very fond of doing as I liked, but I have almost given it up,” she
21665: ended, smiling playfully.
21666: 
21667: “I have not given up doing as I like, but I can very seldom do it,”
21668: said Will. He was standing two yards from her with his mind full of
21669: contradictory desires and resolves—desiring some unmistakable proof
21670: that she loved him, and yet dreading the position into which such a
21671: proof might bring him. “The thing one most longs for may be surrounded
21672: with conditions that would be intolerable.”
21673: 
21674: At this moment Pratt entered and said, “Sir James Chettam is in the
21675: library, madam.”
21676: 
21677: “Ask Sir James to come in here,” said Dorothea, immediately. It was as
21678: if the same electric shock had passed through her and Will. Each of
21679: them felt proudly resistant, and neither looked at the other, while
21680: they awaited Sir James’s entrance.
21681: 
21682: After shaking hands with Dorothea, he bowed as slightly as possible to
21683: Ladislaw, who repaid the slightness exactly, and then going towards
21684: Dorothea, said—
21685: 
21686: “I must say good-by, Mrs. Casaubon; and probably for a long while.”
21687: 
21688: Dorothea put out her hand and said her good-by cordially. The sense
21689: that Sir James was depreciating Will, and behaving rudely to him,
21690: roused her resolution and dignity: there was no touch of confusion in
21691: her manner. And when Will had left the room, she looked with such calm
21692: self-possession at Sir James, saying, “How is Celia?” that he was
21693: obliged to behave as if nothing had annoyed him. And what would be the
21694: use of behaving otherwise? Indeed, Sir James shrank with so much
21695: dislike from the association even in thought of Dorothea with Ladislaw
21696: as her possible lover, that he would himself have wished to avoid an
21697: outward show of displeasure which would have recognized the
21698: disagreeable possibility. If any one had asked him why he shrank in
21699: that way, I am not sure that he would at first have said anything
21700: fuller or more precise than “_That_ Ladislaw!”—though on reflection he
21701: might have urged that Mr. Casaubon’s codicil, barring Dorothea’s
21702: marriage with Will, except under a penalty, was enough to cast
21703: unfitness over any relation at all between them. His aversion was all
21704: the stronger because he felt himself unable to interfere.
21705: 
21706: But Sir James was a power in a way unguessed by himself. Entering at
21707: that moment, he was an incorporation of the strongest reasons through
21708: which Will’s pride became a repellent force, keeping him asunder from
21709: Dorothea.
21710: 
21711: 
21712: 
21713: 
21714: CHAPTER LV.
21715: 
21716: Hath she her faults? I would you had them too.
21717: They are the fruity must of soundest wine;
21718: Or say, they are regenerating fire
21719: Such as hath turned the dense black element
21720: Into a crystal pathway for the sun.
21721: 
21722: 
21723: If youth is the season of hope, it is often so only in the sense that
21724: our elders are hopeful about us; for no age is so apt as youth to think
21725: its emotions, partings, and resolves are the last of their kind. Each
21726: crisis seems final, simply because it is new. We are told that the
21727: oldest inhabitants in Peru do not cease to be agitated by the
21728: earthquakes, but they probably see beyond each shock, and reflect that
21729: there are plenty more to come.
21730: 
21731: To Dorothea, still in that time of youth when the eyes with their long
21732: full lashes look out after their rain of tears unsoiled and unwearied
21733: as a freshly opened passion-flower, that morning’s parting with Will
21734: Ladislaw seemed to be the close of their personal relations. He was
21735: going away into the distance of unknown years, and if ever he came back
21736: he would be another man. The actual state of his mind—his proud resolve
21737: to give the lie beforehand to any suspicion that he would play the
21738: needy adventurer seeking a rich woman—lay quite out of her imagination,
21739: and she had interpreted all his behavior easily enough by her
21740: supposition that Mr. Casaubon’s codicil seemed to him, as it did to
21741: her, a gross and cruel interdict on any active friendship between them.
21742: Their young delight in speaking to each other, and saying what no one
21743: else would care to hear, was forever ended, and become a treasure of
21744: the past. For this very reason she dwelt on it without inward check.
21745: That unique happiness too was dead, and in its shadowed silent chamber
21746: she might vent the passionate grief which she herself wondered at. For
21747: the first time she took down the miniature from the wall and kept it
21748: before her, liking to blend the woman who had been too hardly judged
21749: with the grandson whom her own heart and judgment defended. Can any one
21750: who has rejoiced in woman’s tenderness think it a reproach to her that
21751: she took the little oval picture in her palm and made a bed for it
21752: there, and leaned her cheek upon it, as if that would soothe the
21753: creatures who had suffered unjust condemnation? She did not know then
21754: that it was Love who had come to her briefly, as in a dream before
21755: awaking, with the hues of morning on his wings—that it was Love to whom
21756: she was sobbing her farewell as his image was banished by the blameless
21757: rigor of irresistible day. She only felt that there was something
21758: irrevocably amiss and lost in her lot, and her thoughts about the
21759: future were the more readily shapen into resolve. Ardent souls, ready
21760: to construct their coming lives, are apt to commit themselves to the
21761: fulfilment of their own visions.
21762: 
21763: One day that she went to Freshitt to fulfil her promise of staying all
21764: night and seeing baby washed, Mrs. Cadwallader came to dine, the Rector
21765: being gone on a fishing excursion. It was a warm evening, and even in
21766: the delightful drawing-room, where the fine old turf sloped from the
21767: open window towards a lilied pool and well-planted mounds, the heat was
21768: enough to make Celia in her white muslin and light curls reflect with
21769: pity on what Dodo must feel in her black dress and close cap. But this
21770: was not until some episodes with baby were over, and had left her mind
21771: at leisure. She had seated herself and taken up a fan for some time
21772: before she said, in her quiet guttural—
21773: 
21774: “Dear Dodo, do throw off that cap. I am sure your dress must make you
21775: feel ill.”
21776: 
21777: “I am so used to the cap—it has become a sort of shell,” said Dorothea,
21778: smiling. “I feel rather bare and exposed when it is off.”
21779: 
21780: “I must see you without it; it makes us all warm,” said Celia, throwing
21781: down her fan, and going to Dorothea. It was a pretty picture to see
21782: this little lady in white muslin unfastening the widow’s cap from her
21783: more majestic sister, and tossing it on to a chair. Just as the coils
21784: and braids of dark-brown hair had been set free, Sir James entered the
21785: room. He looked at the released head, and said, “Ah!” in a tone of
21786: satisfaction.
21787: 
21788: “It was I who did it, James,” said Celia. “Dodo need not make such a
21789: slavery of her mourning; she need not wear that cap any more among her
21790: friends.”
21791: 
21792: “My dear Celia,” said Lady Chettam, “a widow must wear her mourning at
21793: least a year.”
21794: 
21795: “Not if she marries again before the end of it,” said Mrs. Cadwallader,
21796: who had some pleasure in startling her good friend the Dowager. Sir
21797: James was annoyed, and leaned forward to play with Celia’s Maltese dog.
21798: 
21799: “That is very rare, I hope,” said Lady Chettam, in a tone intended to
21800: guard against such events. “No friend of ours ever committed herself in
21801: that way except Mrs. Beevor, and it was very painful to Lord Grinsell
21802: when she did so. Her first husband was objectionable, which made it the
21803: greater wonder. And severely she was punished for it. They said Captain
21804: Beevor dragged her about by the hair, and held up loaded pistols at
21805: her.”
21806: 
21807: “Oh, if she took the wrong man!” said Mrs. Cadwallader, who was in a
21808: decidedly wicked mood. “Marriage is always bad then, first or second.
21809: Priority is a poor recommendation in a husband if he has got no other.
21810: I would rather have a good second husband than an indifferent first.”
21811: 
21812: “My dear, your clever tongue runs away with you,” said Lady Chettam. “I
21813: am sure you would be the last woman to marry again prematurely, if our
21814: dear Rector were taken away.”
21815: 
21816: “Oh, I make no vows; it might be a necessary economy. It is lawful to
21817: marry again, I suppose; else we might as well be Hindoos instead of
21818: Christians. Of course if a woman accepts the wrong man, she must take
21819: the consequences, and one who does it twice over deserves her fate. But
21820: if she can marry blood, beauty, and bravery—the sooner the better.”
21821: 
21822: “I think the subject of our conversation is very ill-chosen,” said Sir
21823: James, with a look of disgust. “Suppose we change it.”
21824: 
21825: “Not on my account, Sir James,” said Dorothea, determined not to lose
21826: the opportunity of freeing herself from certain oblique references to
21827: excellent matches. “If you are speaking on my behalf, I can assure you
21828: that no question can be more indifferent and impersonal to me than
21829: second marriage. It is no more to me than if you talked of women going
21830: fox-hunting: whether it is admirable in them or not, I shall not follow
21831: them. Pray let Mrs. Cadwallader amuse herself on that subject as much
21832: as on any other.”
21833: 
21834: “My dear Mrs. Casaubon,” said Lady Chettam, in her stateliest way, “you
21835: do not, I hope, think there was any allusion to you in my mentioning
21836: Mrs. Beevor. It was only an instance that occurred to me. She was
21837: step-daughter to Lord Grinsell: he married Mrs. Teveroy for his second
21838: wife. There could be no possible allusion to you.”
21839: 
21840: “Oh no,” said Celia. “Nobody chose the subject; it all came out of
21841: Dodo’s cap. Mrs. Cadwallader only said what was quite true. A woman
21842: could not be married in a widow’s cap, James.”
21843: 
21844: “Hush, my dear!” said Mrs. Cadwallader. “I will not offend again. I
21845: will not even refer to Dido or Zenobia. Only what are we to talk about?
21846: I, for my part, object to the discussion of Human Nature, because that
21847: is the nature of rectors’ wives.”
21848: 
21849: Later in the evening, after Mrs. Cadwallader was gone, Celia said
21850: privately to Dorothea, “Really, Dodo, taking your cap off made you like
21851: yourself again in more ways than one. You spoke up just as you used to
21852: do, when anything was said to displease you. But I could hardly make
21853: out whether it was James that you thought wrong, or Mrs. Cadwallader.”
21854: 
21855: “Neither,” said Dorothea. “James spoke out of delicacy to me, but he
21856: was mistaken in supposing that I minded what Mrs. Cadwallader said. I
21857: should only mind if there were a law obliging me to take any piece of
21858: blood and beauty that she or anybody else recommended.”
21859: 
21860: “But you know, Dodo, if you ever did marry, it would be all the better
21861: to have blood and beauty,” said Celia, reflecting that Mr. Casaubon had
21862: not been richly endowed with those gifts, and that it would be well to
21863: caution Dorothea in time.
21864: 
21865: “Don’t be anxious, Kitty; I have quite other thoughts about my life. I
21866: shall never marry again,” said Dorothea, touching her sister’s chin,
21867: and looking at her with indulgent affection. Celia was nursing her
21868: baby, and Dorothea had come to say good-night to her.
21869: 
21870: “Really—quite?” said Celia. “Not anybody at all—if he were very
21871: wonderful indeed?”
21872: 
21873: Dorothea shook her head slowly. “Not anybody at all. I have delightful
21874: plans. I should like to take a great deal of land, and drain it, and
21875: make a little colony, where everybody should work, and all the work
21876: should be done well. I should know every one of the people and be their
21877: friend. I am going to have great consultations with Mr. Garth: he can
21878: tell me almost everything I want to know.”
21879: 
21880: “Then you _will_ be happy, if you have a plan, Dodo?” said Celia.
21881: “Perhaps little Arthur will like plans when he grows up, and then he
21882: can help you.”
21883: 
21884: Sir James was informed that same night that Dorothea was really quite
21885: set against marrying anybody at all, and was going to take to “all
21886: sorts of plans,” just like what she used to have. Sir James made no
21887: remark. To his secret feeling there was something repulsive in a
21888: woman’s second marriage, and no match would prevent him from feeling it
21889: a sort of desecration for Dorothea. He was aware that the world would
21890: regard such a sentiment as preposterous, especially in relation to a
21891: woman of one-and-twenty; the practice of “the world” being to treat of
21892: a young widow’s second marriage as certain and probably near, and to
21893: smile with meaning if the widow acts accordingly. But if Dorothea did
21894: choose to espouse her solitude, he felt that the resolution would well
21895: become her.

21900: CHAPTER LVI.
21901: 
21902: “How happy is he born and taught
21903: That serveth not another’s will;
21904: Whose armor is his honest thought,
21905: And simple truth his only skill!
21906: . . . . . . .
21907: This man is freed from servile bands
21908: Of hope to rise or fear to fall;
21909: Lord of himself though not of lands;
21910: And having nothing yet hath all.”
21911: —SIR HENRY WOTTON.
21912: 
21913: 
21914: Dorothea’s confidence in Caleb Garth’s knowledge, which had begun on
21915: her hearing that he approved of her cottages, had grown fast during her
21916: stay at Freshitt, Sir James having induced her to take rides over the
21917: two estates in company with himself and Caleb, who quite returned her
21918: admiration, and told his wife that Mrs. Casaubon had a head for
21919: business most uncommon in a woman. It must be remembered that by
21920: “business” Caleb never meant money transactions, but the skilful
21921: application of labor.
21922: 
21923: “Most uncommon!” repeated Caleb. “She said a thing I often used to
21924: think myself when I was a lad:—‘Mr. Garth, I should like to feel, if I
21925: lived to be old, that I had improved a great piece of land and built a
21926: great many good cottages, because the work is of a healthy kind while
21927: it is being done, and after it is done, men are the better for it.’
21928: Those were the very words: she sees into things in that way.”
21929: 
21930: “But womanly, I hope,” said Mrs. Garth, half suspecting that Mrs.
21931: Casaubon might not hold the true principle of subordination.
21932: 
21933: “Oh, you can’t think!” said Caleb, shaking his head. “You would like to
21934: hear her speak, Susan. She speaks in such plain words, and a voice like
21935: music. Bless me! it reminds me of bits in the ‘Messiah’—‘and
21936: straightway there appeared a multitude of the heavenly host, praising
21937: God and saying;’ it has a tone with it that satisfies your ear.”
21938: 
21939: Caleb was very fond of music, and when he could afford it went to hear
21940: an oratorio that came within his reach, returning from it with a
21941: profound reverence for this mighty structure of tones, which made him
21942: sit meditatively, looking on the floor and throwing much unutterable
21943: language into his outstretched hands.
21944: 
21945: With this good understanding between them, it was natural that Dorothea
21946: asked Mr. Garth to undertake any business connected with the three
21947: farms and the numerous tenements attached to Lowick Manor; indeed, his
21948: expectation of getting work for two was being fast fulfilled. As he
21949: said, “Business breeds.” And one form of business which was beginning
21950: to breed just then was the construction of railways. A projected line
21951: was to run through Lowick parish where the cattle had hitherto grazed
21952: in a peace unbroken by astonishment; and thus it happened that the
21953: infant struggles of the railway system entered into the affairs of
21954: Caleb Garth, and determined the course of this history with regard to
21955: two persons who were dear to him. The submarine railway may have its
21956: difficulties; but the bed of the sea is not divided among various
21957: landed proprietors with claims for damages not only measurable but
21958: sentimental. In the hundred to which Middlemarch belonged railways were
21959: as exciting a topic as the Reform Bill or the imminent horrors of
21960: Cholera, and those who held the most decided views on the subject were
21961: women and landholders. Women both old and young regarded travelling by
21962: steam as presumptuous and dangerous, and argued against it by saying
21963: that nothing should induce them to get into a railway carriage; while
21964: proprietors, differing from each other in their arguments as much as
21965: Mr. Solomon Featherstone differed from Lord Medlicote, were yet
21966: unanimous in the opinion that in selling land, whether to the Enemy of
21967: mankind or to a company obliged to purchase, these pernicious agencies
21968: must be made to pay a very high price to landowners for permission to
21969: injure mankind.
21970: 
21971: But the slower wits, such as Mr. Solomon and Mrs. Waule, who both
21972: occupied land of their own, took a long time to arrive at this
21973: conclusion, their minds halting at the vivid conception of what it
21974: would be to cut the Big Pasture in two, and turn it into three-cornered
21975: bits, which would be “nohow;” while accommodation-bridges and high
21976: payments were remote and incredible.
21977: 
21978: “The cows will all cast their calves, brother,” said Mrs. Waule, in a
21979: tone of deep melancholy, “if the railway comes across the Near Close;
21980: and I shouldn’t wonder at the mare too, if she was in foal. It’s a poor
21981: tale if a widow’s property is to be spaded away, and the law say
21982: nothing to it. What’s to hinder ’em from cutting right and left if they
21983: begin? It’s well known, _I_ can’t fight.”
21984: 
21985: “The best way would be to say nothing, and set somebody on to send ’em
21986: away with a flea in their ear, when they came spying and measuring,”
21987: said Solomon. “Folks did that about Brassing, by what I can understand.
21988: It’s all a pretence, if the truth was known, about their being forced
21989: to take one way. Let ’em go cutting in another parish. And I don’t
21990: believe in any pay to make amends for bringing a lot of ruffians to
21991: trample your crops. Where’s a company’s pocket?”
21992: 
21993: “Brother Peter, God forgive him, got money out of a company,” said Mrs.
21994: Waule. “But that was for the manganese. That wasn’t for railways to
21995: blow you to pieces right and left.”
21996: 
21997: “Well, there’s this to be said, Jane,” Mr. Solomon concluded, lowering
21998: his voice in a cautious manner—“the more spokes we put in their wheel,
21999: the more they’ll pay us to let ’em go on, if they must come whether or
22000: not.”
22001: 
22002: This reasoning of Mr. Solomon’s was perhaps less thorough than he
22003: imagined, his cunning bearing about the same relation to the course of
22004: railways as the cunning of a diplomatist bears to the general chill or
22005: catarrh of the solar system. But he set about acting on his views in a
22006: thoroughly diplomatic manner, by stimulating suspicion. His side of
22007: Lowick was the most remote from the village, and the houses of the
22008: laboring people were either lone cottages or were collected in a hamlet
22009: called Frick, where a water-mill and some stone-pits made a little
22010: centre of slow, heavy-shouldered industry.
22011: 
22012: In the absence of any precise idea as to what railways were, public
22013: opinion in Frick was against them; for the human mind in that grassy
22014: corner had not the proverbial tendency to admire the unknown, holding
22015: rather that it was likely to be against the poor man, and that
22016: suspicion was the only wise attitude with regard to it. Even the rumor
22017: of Reform had not yet excited any millennial expectations in Frick,
22018: there being no definite promise in it, as of gratuitous grains to
22019: fatten Hiram Ford’s pig, or of a publican at the “Weights and Scales”
22020: who would brew beer for nothing, or of an offer on the part of the
22021: three neighboring farmers to raise wages during winter. And without
22022: distinct good of this kind in its promises, Reform seemed on a footing
22023: with the bragging of pedlers, which was a hint for distrust to every
22024: knowing person. The men of Frick were not ill-fed, and were less given
22025: to fanaticism than to a strong muscular suspicion; less inclined to
22026: believe that they were peculiarly cared for by heaven, than to regard
22027: heaven itself as rather disposed to take them in—a disposition
22028: observable in the weather.
22029: 
22030: Thus the mind of Frick was exactly of the sort for Mr. Solomon
22031: Featherstone to work upon, he having more plenteous ideas of the same
22032: order, with a suspicion of heaven and earth which was better fed and
22033: more entirely at leisure. Solomon was overseer of the roads at that
22034: time, and on his slow-paced cob often took his rounds by Frick to look
22035: at the workmen getting the stones there, pausing with a mysterious
22036: deliberation, which might have misled you into supposing that he had
22037: some other reason for staying than the mere want of impulse to move.
22038: After looking for a long while at any work that was going on, he would
22039: raise his eyes a little and look at the horizon; finally he would shake
22040: his bridle, touch his horse with the whip, and get it to move slowly
22041: onward. The hour-hand of a clock was quick by comparison with Mr.
22042: Solomon, who had an agreeable sense that he could afford to be slow. He
22043: was in the habit of pausing for a cautious, vaguely designing chat with
22044: every hedger or ditcher on his way, and was especially willing to
22045: listen even to news which he had heard before, feeling himself at an
22046: advantage over all narrators in partially disbelieving them. One day,
22047: however, he got into a dialogue with Hiram Ford, a wagoner, in which he
22048: himself contributed information. He wished to know whether Hiram had
22049: seen fellows with staves and instruments spying about: they called
22050: themselves railroad people, but there was no telling what they were or
22051: what they meant to do. The least they pretended was that they were
22052: going to cut Lowick Parish into sixes and sevens.
22053: 
22054: “Why, there’ll be no stirrin’ from one pla-ace to another,” said Hiram,
22055: thinking of his wagon and horses.
22056: 
22057: “Not a bit,” said Mr. Solomon. “And cutting up fine land such as this
22058: parish! Let ’em go into Tipton, say I. But there’s no knowing what
22059: there is at the bottom of it. Traffic is what they put for’ard; but
22060: it’s to do harm to the land and the poor man in the long-run.”
22061: 
22062: “Why, they’re Lunnon chaps, I reckon,” said Hiram, who had a dim notion
22063: of London as a centre of hostility to the country.
22064: 
22065: “Ay, to be sure. And in some parts against Brassing, by what I’ve heard
22066: say, the folks fell on ’em when they were spying, and broke their
22067: peep-holes as they carry, and drove ’em away, so as they knew better
22068: than come again.”
22069: 
22070: “It war good foon, I’d be bound,” said Hiram, whose fun was much
22071: restricted by circumstances.
22072: 
22073: “Well, I wouldn’t meddle with ’em myself,” said Solomon. “But some say
22074: this country’s seen its best days, and the sign is, as it’s being
22075: overrun with these fellows trampling right and left, and wanting to cut
22076: it up into railways; and all for the big traffic to swallow up the
22077: little, so as there shan’t be a team left on the land, nor a whip to
22078: crack.”
22079: 
22080: “I’ll crack _my_ whip about their ear’n, afore they bring it to that,
22081: though,” said Hiram, while Mr. Solomon, shaking his bridle, moved
22082: onward.
22083: 
22084: Nettle-seed needs no digging. The ruin of this countryside by railroads
22085: was discussed, not only at the “Weights and Scales,” but in the
22086: hay-field, where the muster of working hands gave opportunities for
22087: talk such as were rarely had through the rural year.
22088: 
22089: One morning, not long after that interview between Mr. Farebrother and
22090: Mary Garth, in which she confessed to him her feeling for Fred Vincy,
22091: it happened that her father had some business which took him to
22092: Yoddrell’s farm in the direction of Frick: it was to measure and value
22093: an outlying piece of land belonging to Lowick Manor, which Caleb
22094: expected to dispose of advantageously for Dorothea (it must be
22095: confessed that his bias was towards getting the best possible terms
22096: from railroad companies). He put up his gig at Yoddrell’s, and in
22097: walking with his assistant and measuring-chain to the scene of his
22098: work, he encountered the party of the company’s agents, who were
22099: adjusting their spirit-level. After a little chat he left them,
22100: observing that by-and-by they would reach him again where he was going
22101: to measure. It was one of those gray mornings after light rains, which
22102: become delicious about twelve o’clock, when the clouds part a little,
22103: and the scent of the earth is sweet along the lanes and by the
22104: hedgerows.
22105: 
22106: The scent would have been sweeter to Fred Vincy, who was coming along
22107: the lanes on horseback, if his mind had not been worried by
22108: unsuccessful efforts to imagine what he was to do, with his father on
22109: one side expecting him straightway to enter the Church, with Mary on
22110: the other threatening to forsake him if he did enter it, and with the
22111: working-day world showing no eager need whatever of a young gentleman
22112: without capital and generally unskilled. It was the harder to Fred’s
22113: disposition because his father, satisfied that he was no longer
22114: rebellious, was in good humor with him, and had sent him on this
22115: pleasant ride to see after some greyhounds. Even when he had fixed on
22116: what he should do, there would be the task of telling his father. But
22117: it must be admitted that the fixing, which had to come first, was the
22118: more difficult task:—what secular avocation on earth was there for a
22119: young man (whose friends could not get him an “appointment”) which was
22120: at once gentlemanly, lucrative, and to be followed without special
22121: knowledge? Riding along the lanes by Frick in this mood, and slackening
22122: his pace while he reflected whether he should venture to go round by
22123: Lowick Parsonage to call on Mary, he could see over the hedges from one
22124: field to another. Suddenly a noise roused his attention, and on the far
22125: side of a field on his left hand he could see six or seven men in
22126: smock-frocks with hay-forks in their hands making an offensive approach
22127: towards the four railway agents who were facing them, while Caleb Garth
22128: and his assistant were hastening across the field to join the
22129: threatened group. Fred, delayed a few moments by having to find the
22130: gate, could not gallop up to the spot before the party in smock-frocks,
22131: whose work of turning the hay had not been too pressing after
22132: swallowing their mid-day beer, were driving the men in coats before
22133: them with their hay-forks; while Caleb Garth’s assistant, a lad of
22134: seventeen, who had snatched up the spirit-level at Caleb’s order, had
22135: been knocked down and seemed to be lying helpless. The coated men had
22136: the advantage as runners, and Fred covered their retreat by getting in
22137: front of the smock-frocks and charging them suddenly enough to throw
22138: their chase into confusion. “What do you confounded fools mean?”
22139: shouted Fred, pursuing the divided group in a zigzag, and cutting right
22140: and left with his whip. “I’ll swear to every one of you before the
22141: magistrate. You’ve knocked the lad down and killed him, for what I
22142: know. You’ll every one of you be hanged at the next assizes, if you
22143: don’t mind,” said Fred, who afterwards laughed heartily as he
22144: remembered his own phrases.
22145: 
22146: The laborers had been driven through the gate-way into their hay-field,
22147: and Fred had checked his horse, when Hiram Ford, observing himself at a
22148: safe challenging distance, turned back and shouted a defiance which he
22149: did not know to be Homeric.
22150: 
22151: “Yo’re a coward, yo are. Yo git off your horse, young measter, and I’ll
22152: have a round wi’ ye, I wull. Yo daredn’t come on wi’out your hoss an’
22153: whip. I’d soon knock the breath out on ye, I would.”
22154: 
22155: “Wait a minute, and I’ll come back presently, and have a round with you
22156: all in turn, if you like,” said Fred, who felt confidence in his power
22157: of boxing with his dearly beloved brethren. But just now he wanted to
22158: hasten back to Caleb and the prostrate youth.
22159: 
22160: The lad’s ankle was strained, and he was in much pain from it, but he
22161: was no further hurt, and Fred placed him on the horse that he might
22162: ride to Yoddrell’s and be taken care of there.
22163: 
22164: “Let them put the horse in the stable, and tell the surveyors they can
22165: come back for their traps,” said Fred. “The ground is clear now.”
22166: 
22167: “No, no,” said Caleb, “here’s a breakage. They’ll have to give up for
22168: to-day, and it will be as well. Here, take the things before you on the
22169: horse, Tom. They’ll see you coming, and they’ll turn back.”
22170: 
22171: “I’m glad I happened to be here at the right moment, Mr. Garth,” said
22172: Fred, as Tom rode away. “No knowing what might have happened if the
22173: cavalry had not come up in time.”
22174: 
22175: “Ay, ay, it was lucky,” said Caleb, speaking rather absently, and
22176: looking towards the spot where he had been at work at the moment of
22177: interruption. “But—deuce take it—this is what comes of men being
22178: fools—I’m hindered of my day’s work. I can’t get along without somebody
22179: to help me with the measuring-chain. However!” He was beginning to move
22180: towards the spot with a look of vexation, as if he had forgotten Fred’s
22181: presence, but suddenly he turned round and said quickly, “What have you
22182: got to do to-day, young fellow?”
22183: 
22184: “Nothing, Mr. Garth. I’ll help you with pleasure—can I?” said Fred,
22185: with a sense that he should be courting Mary when he was helping her
22186: father.
22187: 
22188: “Well, you mustn’t mind stooping and getting hot.”
22189: 
22190: “I don’t mind anything. Only I want to go first and have a round with
22191: that hulky fellow who turned to challenge me. It would be a good lesson
22192: for him. I shall not be five minutes.”
22193: 
22194: “Nonsense!” said Caleb, with his most peremptory intonation. “I shall
22195: go and speak to the men myself. It’s all ignorance. Somebody has been
22196: telling them lies. The poor fools don’t know any better.”
22197: 
22198: “I shall go with you, then,” said Fred.
22199: 
22200: “No, no; stay where you are. I don’t want your young blood. I can take
22201: care of myself.”
22202: 
22203: Caleb was a powerful man and knew little of any fear except the fear of
22204: hurting others and the fear of having to speechify. But he felt it his
22205: duty at this moment to try and give a little harangue. There was a
22206: striking mixture in him—which came from his having always been a
22207: hard-working man himself—of rigorous notions about workmen and
22208: practical indulgence towards them. To do a good day’s work and to do it
22209: well, he held to be part of their welfare, as it was the chief part of
22210: his own happiness; but he had a strong sense of fellowship with them.
22211: When he advanced towards the laborers they had not gone to work again,
22212: but were standing in that form of rural grouping which consists in each
22213: turning a shoulder towards the other, at a distance of two or three
22214: yards. They looked rather sulkily at Caleb, who walked quickly with one
22215: hand in his pocket and the other thrust between the buttons of his
22216: waistcoat, and had his every-day mild air when he paused among them.
22217: 
22218: “Why, my lads, how’s this?” he began, taking as usual to brief phrases,
22219: which seemed pregnant to himself, because he had many thoughts lying
22220: under them, like the abundant roots of a plant that just manages to
22221: peep above the water. “How came you to make such a mistake as this?
22222: Somebody has been telling you lies. You thought those men up there
22223: wanted to do mischief.”
22224: 
22225: “Aw!” was the answer, dropped at intervals by each according to his
22226: degree of unreadiness.
22227: 
22228: “Nonsense! No such thing! They’re looking out to see which way the
22229: railroad is to take. Now, my lads, you can’t hinder the railroad: it
22230: will be made whether you like it or not. And if you go fighting against
22231: it, you’ll get yourselves into trouble. The law gives those men leave
22232: to come here on the land. The owner has nothing to say against it, and
22233: if you meddle with them you’ll have to do with the constable and
22234: Justice Blakesley, and with the handcuffs and Middlemarch jail. And you
22235: might be in for it now, if anybody informed against you.”
22236: 
22237: Caleb paused here, and perhaps the greatest orator could not have
22238: chosen either his pause or his images better for the occasion.
22239: 
22240: “But come, you didn’t mean any harm. Somebody told you the railroad was
22241: a bad thing. That was a lie. It may do a bit of harm here and there, to
22242: this and to that; and so does the sun in heaven. But the railway’s a
22243: good thing.”
22244: 
22245: “Aw! good for the big folks to make money out on,” said old Timothy
22246: Cooper, who had stayed behind turning his hay while the others had been
22247: gone on their spree;—“I’n seen lots o’ things turn up sin’ I war a
22248: young un—the war an’ the peace, and the canells, an’ the oald King
22249: George, an’ the Regen’, an’ the new King George, an’ the new un as has
22250: got a new ne-ame—an’ it’s been all aloike to the poor mon. What’s the
22251: canells been t’ him? They’n brought him neyther me-at nor be-acon, nor
22252: wage to lay by, if he didn’t save it wi’ clemmin’ his own inside. Times
22253: ha’ got wusser for him sin’ I war a young un. An’ so it’ll be wi’ the
22254: railroads. They’ll on’y leave the poor mon furder behind. But them are
22255: fools as meddle, and so I told the chaps here. This is the big folks’s
22256: world, this is. But yo’re for the big folks, Muster Garth, yo are.”
22257: 
22258: Timothy was a wiry old laborer, of a type lingering in those times—who
22259: had his savings in a stocking-foot, lived in a lone cottage, and was
22260: not to be wrought on by any oratory, having as little of the feudal
22261: spirit, and believing as little, as if he had not been totally
22262: unacquainted with the Age of Reason and the Rights of Man. Caleb was in
22263: a difficulty known to any person attempting in dark times and
22264: unassisted by miracle to reason with rustics who are in possession of
22265: an undeniable truth which they know through a hard process of feeling,
22266: and can let it fall like a giant’s club on your neatly carved argument
22267: for a social benefit which they do not feel. Caleb had no cant at
22268: command, even if he could have chosen to use it; and he had been
22269: accustomed to meet all such difficulties in no other way than by doing
22270: his “business” faithfully. He answered—
22271: 
22272: “If you don’t think well of me, Tim, never mind; that’s neither here
22273: nor there now. Things may be bad for the poor man—bad they are; but I
22274: want the lads here not to do what will make things worse for
22275: themselves. The cattle may have a heavy load, but it won’t help ’em to
22276: throw it over into the roadside pit, when it’s partly their own
22277: fodder.”
22278: 
22279: “We war on’y for a bit o’ foon,” said Hiram, who was beginning to see
22280: consequences. “That war all we war arter.”
22281: 
22282: “Well, promise me not to meddle again, and I’ll see that nobody informs
22283: against you.”
22284: 
22285: “I’n ne’er meddled, an’ I’n no call to promise,” said Timothy.
22286: 
22287: “No, but the rest. Come, I’m as hard at work as any of you to-day, and
22288: I can’t spare much time. Say you’ll be quiet without the constable.”
22289: 
22290: “Aw, we wooant meddle—they may do as they loike for oos”—were the forms
22291: in which Caleb got his pledges; and then he hastened back to Fred, who
22292: had followed him, and watched him in the gateway.
22293: 
22294: They went to work, and Fred helped vigorously. His spirits had risen,
22295: and he heartily enjoyed a good slip in the moist earth under the
22296: hedgerow, which soiled his perfect summer trousers. Was it his
22297: successful onset which had elated him, or the satisfaction of helping
22298: Mary’s father? Something more. The accidents of the morning had helped
22299: his frustrated imagination to shape an employment for himself which had
22300: several attractions. I am not sure that certain fibres in Mr. Garth’s
22301: mind had not resumed their old vibration towards the very end which now
22302: revealed itself to Fred. For the effective accident is but the touch of
22303: fire where there is oil and tow; and it always appeared to Fred that
22304: the railway brought the needed touch. But they went on in silence
22305: except when their business demanded speech. At last, when they had
22306: finished and were walking away, Mr. Garth said—
22307: 
22308: “A young fellow needn’t be a B. A. to do this sort of work, eh, Fred?”
22309: 
22310: “I wish I had taken to it before I had thought of being a B. A.,” said
22311: Fred. He paused a moment, and then added, more hesitatingly, “Do you
22312: think I am too old to learn your business, Mr. Garth?”
22313: 
22314: “My business is of many sorts, my boy,” said Mr. Garth, smiling. “A
22315: good deal of what I know can only come from experience: you can’t learn
22316: it off as you learn things out of a book. But you are young enough to
22317: lay a foundation yet.” Caleb pronounced the last sentence emphatically,
22318: but paused in some uncertainty. He had been under the impression lately
22319: that Fred had made up his mind to enter the Church.
22320: 
22321: “You do think I could do some good at it, if I were to try?” said Fred,
22322: more eagerly.
22323: 
22324: “That depends,” said Caleb, turning his head on one side and lowering
22325: his voice, with the air of a man who felt himself to be saying
22326: something deeply religious. “You must be sure of two things: you must
22327: love your work, and not be always looking over the edge of it, wanting
22328: your play to begin. And the other is, you must not be ashamed of your
22329: work, and think it would be more honorable to you to be doing something
22330: else. You must have a pride in your own work and in learning to do it
22331: well, and not be always saying, There’s this and there’s that—if I had
22332: this or that to do, I might make something of it. No matter what a man
22333: is—I wouldn’t give twopence for him”—here Caleb’s mouth looked bitter,
22334: and he snapped his fingers—“whether he was the prime minister or the
22335: rick-thatcher, if he didn’t do well what he undertook to do.”
22336: 
22337: “I can never feel that I should do that in being a clergyman,” said
22338: Fred, meaning to take a step in argument.
22339: 
22340: “Then let it alone, my boy,” said Caleb, abruptly, “else you’ll never
22341: be easy. Or, if you _are_ easy, you’ll be a poor stick.”
22342: 
22343: “That is very nearly what Mary thinks about it,” said Fred, coloring.
22344: “I think you must know what I feel for Mary, Mr. Garth: I hope it does
22345: not displease you that I have always loved her better than any one
22346: else, and that I shall never love any one as I love her.”
22347: 
22348: The expression of Caleb’s face was visibly softening while Fred spoke.
22349: But he swung his head with a solemn slowness, and said—
22350: 
22351: “That makes things more serious, Fred, if you want to take Mary’s
22352: happiness into your keeping.”
22353: 
22354: “I know that, Mr. Garth,” said Fred, eagerly, “and I would do anything
22355: for _her_. She says she will never have me if I go into the Church; and
22356: I shall be the most miserable devil in the world if I lose all hope of
22357: Mary. Really, if I could get some other profession, business—anything
22358: that I am at all fit for, I would work hard, I would deserve your good
22359: opinion. I should like to have to do with outdoor things. I know a good
22360: deal about land and cattle already. I used to believe, you know—though
22361: you will think me rather foolish for it—that I should have land of my
22362: own. I am sure knowledge of that sort would come easily to me,
22363: especially if I could be under you in any way.”
22364: 
22365: “Softly, my boy,” said Caleb, having the image of “Susan” before his
22366: eyes. “What have you said to your father about all this?”
22367: 
22368: “Nothing, yet; but I must tell him. I am only waiting to know what I
22369: can do instead of entering the Church. I am very sorry to disappoint
22370: him, but a man ought to be allowed to judge for himself when he is
22371: four-and-twenty. How could I know when I was fifteen, what it would be
22372: right for me to do now? My education was a mistake.”
22373: 
22374: “But hearken to this, Fred,” said Caleb. “Are you sure Mary is fond of
22375: you, or would ever have you?”
22376: 
22377: “I asked Mr. Farebrother to talk to her, because she had forbidden me—I
22378: didn’t know what else to do,” said Fred, apologetically. “And he says
22379: that I have every reason to hope, if I can put myself in an honorable
22380: position—I mean, out of the Church. I dare say you think it
22381: unwarrantable in me, Mr. Garth, to be troubling you and obtruding my
22382: own wishes about Mary, before I have done anything at all for myself.
22383: Of course I have not the least claim—indeed, I have already a debt to
22384: you which will never be discharged, even when I have been able to pay
22385: it in the shape of money.”
22386: 
22387: “Yes, my boy, you have a claim,” said Caleb, with much feeling in his
22388: voice. “The young ones have always a claim on the old to help them
22389: forward. I was young myself once and had to do without much help; but
22390: help would have been welcome to me, if it had been only for the
22391: fellow-feeling’s sake. But I must consider. Come to me to-morrow at the
22392: office, at nine o’clock. At the office, mind.”
22393: 
22394: Mr. Garth would take no important step without consulting Susan, but it
22395: must be confessed that before he reached home he had taken his
22396: resolution. With regard to a large number of matters about which other
22397: men are decided or obstinate, he was the most easily manageable man in
22398: the world. He never knew what meat he would choose, and if Susan had
22399: said that they ought to live in a four-roomed cottage, in order to
22400: save, he would have said, “Let us go,” without inquiring into details.
22401: But where Caleb’s feeling and judgment strongly pronounced, he was a
22402: ruler; and in spite of his mildness and timidity in reproving, every
22403: one about him knew that on the exceptional occasions when he chose, he
22404: was absolute. He never, indeed, chose to be absolute except on some one
22405: else’s behalf. On ninety-nine points Mrs. Garth decided, but on the
22406: hundredth she was often aware that she would have to perform the
22407: singularly difficult task of carrying out her own principle, and to
22408: make herself subordinate.
22409: 
22410: “It is come round as I thought, Susan,” said Caleb, when they were
22411: seated alone in the evening. He had already narrated the adventure
22412: which had brought about Fred’s sharing in his work, but had kept back
22413: the further result. “The children _are_ fond of each other—I mean, Fred
22414: and Mary.”
22415: 
22416: Mrs. Garth laid her work on her knee, and fixed her penetrating eyes
22417: anxiously on her husband.
22418: 
22419: “After we’d done our work, Fred poured it all out to me. He can’t bear
22420: to be a clergyman, and Mary says she won’t have him if he is one; and
22421: the lad would like to be under me and give his mind to business. And
22422: I’ve determined to take him and make a man of him.”
22423: 
22424: “Caleb!” said Mrs. Garth, in a deep contralto, expressive of resigned
22425: astonishment.
22426: 
22427: “It’s a fine thing to do,” said Mr. Garth, settling himself firmly
22428: against the back of his chair, and grasping the elbows. “I shall have
22429: trouble with him, but I think I shall carry it through. The lad loves
22430: Mary, and a true love for a good woman is a great thing, Susan. It
22431: shapes many a rough fellow.”
22432: 
22433: “Has Mary spoken to you on the subject?” said Mrs Garth, secretly a
22434: little hurt that she had to be informed on it herself.
22435: 
22436: “Not a word. I asked her about Fred once; I gave her a bit of a
22437: warning. But she assured me she would never marry an idle
22438: self-indulgent man—nothing since. But it seems Fred set on Mr.
22439: Farebrother to talk to her, because she had forbidden him to speak
22440: himself, and Mr. Farebrother has found out that she is fond of Fred,
22441: but says he must not be a clergyman. Fred’s heart is fixed on Mary,
22442: that I can see: it gives me a good opinion of the lad—and we always
22443: liked him, Susan.”
22444: 
22445: “It is a pity for Mary, I think,” said Mrs. Garth.
22446: 
22447: “Why—a pity?”
22448: 
22449: “Because, Caleb, she might have had a man who is worth twenty Fred
22450: Vincy’s.”
22451: 
22452: “Ah?” said Caleb, with surprise.
22453: 
22454: “I firmly believe that Mr. Farebrother is attached to her, and meant to
22455: make her an offer; but of course, now that Fred has used him as an
22456: envoy, there is an end to that better prospect.” There was a severe
22457: precision in Mrs. Garth’s utterance. She was vexed and disappointed,
22458: but she was bent on abstaining from useless words.
22459: 
22460: Caleb was silent a few moments under a conflict of feelings. He looked
22461: at the floor and moved his head and hands in accompaniment to some
22462: inward argumentation. At last he said—
22463: 
22464: “That would have made me very proud and happy, Susan, and I should have
22465: been glad for your sake. I’ve always felt that your belongings have
22466: never been on a level with you. But you took me, though I was a plain
22467: man.”
22468: 
22469: “I took the best and cleverest man I had ever known,” said Mrs. Garth,
22470: convinced that _she_ would never have loved any one who came short of
22471: that mark.
22472: 
22473: “Well, perhaps others thought you might have done better. But it would
22474: have been worse for me. And that is what touches me close about Fred.
22475: The lad is good at bottom, and clever enough to do, if he’s put in the
22476: right way; and he loves and honors my daughter beyond anything, and she
22477: has given him a sort of promise according to what he turns out. I say,
22478: that young man’s soul is in my hand; and I’ll do the best I can for
22479: him, so help me God! It’s my duty, Susan.”
22480: 
22481: Mrs. Garth was not given to tears, but there was a large one rolling
22482: down her face before her husband had finished. It came from the
22483: pressure of various feelings, in which there was much affection and
22484: some vexation. She wiped it away quickly, saying—
22485: 
22486: “Few men besides you would think it a duty to add to their anxieties in
22487: that way, Caleb.”
22488: 
22489: “That signifies nothing—what other men would think. I’ve got a clear
22490: feeling inside me, and that I shall follow; and I hope your heart will
22491: go with me, Susan, in making everything as light as can be to Mary,
22492: poor child.”
22493: 
22494: Caleb, leaning back in his chair, looked with anxious appeal towards
22495: his wife. She rose and kissed him, saying, “God bless you, Caleb! Our
22496: children have a good father.”
22497: 
22498: But she went out and had a hearty cry to make up for the suppression of
22499: her words. She felt sure that her husband’s conduct would be
22500: misunderstood, and about Fred she was rational and unhopeful. Which
22501: would turn out to have the more foresight in it—her rationality or
22502: Caleb’s ardent generosity?
22503: 
22504: When Fred went to the office the next morning, there was a test to be
22505: gone through which he was not prepared for.
22506: 
22507: “Now Fred,” said Caleb, “you will have some desk-work. I have always
22508: done a good deal of writing myself, but I can’t do without help, and as
22509: I want you to understand the accounts and get the values into your
22510: head, I mean to do without another clerk. So you must buckle to. How
22511: are you at writing and arithmetic?”
22512: 
22513: Fred felt an awkward movement of the heart; he had not thought of
22514: desk-work; but he was in a resolute mood, and not going to shrink. “I’m
22515: not afraid of arithmetic, Mr. Garth: it always came easily to me. I
22516: think you know my writing.”
22517: 
22518: “Let us see,” said Caleb, taking up a pen, examining it carefully and
22519: handing it, well dipped, to Fred with a sheet of ruled paper. “Copy me
22520: a line or two of that valuation, with the figures at the end.”
22521: 
22522: At that time the opinion existed that it was beneath a gentleman to
22523: write legibly, or with a hand in the least suitable to a clerk. Fred
22524: wrote the lines demanded in a hand as gentlemanly as that of any
22525: viscount or bishop of the day: the vowels were all alike and the
22526: consonants only distinguishable as turning up or down, the strokes had
22527: a blotted solidity and the letters disdained to keep the line—in short,
22528: it was a manuscript of that venerable kind easy to interpret when you
22529: know beforehand what the writer means.
22530: 
22531: As Caleb looked on, his visage showed a growing depression, but when
22532: Fred handed him the paper he gave something like a snarl, and rapped
22533: the paper passionately with the back of his hand. Bad work like this
22534: dispelled all Caleb’s mildness.
22535: 
22536: “The deuce!” he exclaimed, snarlingly. “To think that this is a country
22537: where a man’s education may cost hundreds and hundreds, and it turns
22538: you out this!” Then in a more pathetic tone, pushing up his spectacles
22539: and looking at the unfortunate scribe, “The Lord have mercy on us,
22540: Fred, I can’t put up with this!”
22541: 
22542: “What can I do, Mr. Garth?” said Fred, whose spirits had sunk very low,
22543: not only at the estimate of his handwriting, but at the vision of
22544: himself as liable to be ranked with office clerks.
22545: 
22546: “Do? Why, you must learn to form your letters and keep the line. What’s
22547: the use of writing at all if nobody can understand it?” asked Caleb,
22548: energetically, quite preoccupied with the bad quality of the work. “Is
22549: there so little business in the world that you must be sending puzzles
22550: over the country? But that’s the way people are brought up. I should
22551: lose no end of time with the letters some people send me, if Susan did
22552: not make them out for me. It’s disgusting.” Here Caleb tossed the paper
22553: from him.
22554: 
22555: Any stranger peeping into the office at that moment might have wondered
22556: what was the drama between the indignant man of business, and the
22557: fine-looking young fellow whose blond complexion was getting rather
22558: patchy as he bit his lip with mortification. Fred was struggling with
22559: many thoughts. Mr. Garth had been so kind and encouraging at the
22560: beginning of their interview, that gratitude and hopefulness had been
22561: at a high pitch, and the downfall was proportionate. He had not thought
22562: of desk-work—in fact, like the majority of young gentlemen, he wanted
22563: an occupation which should be free from disagreeables. I cannot tell
22564: what might have been the consequences if he had not distinctly promised
22565: himself that he would go to Lowick to see Mary and tell her that he was
22566: engaged to work under her father. He did not like to disappoint himself
22567: there.
22568: 
22569: “I am very sorry,” were all the words that he could muster. But Mr.
22570: Garth was already relenting.
22571: 
22572: “We must make the best of it, Fred,” he began, with a return to his
22573: usual quiet tone. “Every man can learn to write. I taught myself. Go at
22574: it with a will, and sit up at night if the day-time isn’t enough. We’ll
22575: be patient, my boy. Callum shall go on with the books for a bit, while
22576: you are learning. But now I must be off,” said Caleb, rising. “You must
22577: let your father know our agreement. You’ll save me Callum’s salary, you
22578: know, when you can write; and I can afford to give you eighty pounds
22579: for the first year, and more after.”
22580: 
22581: When Fred made the necessary disclosure to his parents, the relative
22582: effect on the two was a surprise which entered very deeply into his
22583: memory. He went straight from Mr. Garth’s office to the warehouse,
22584: rightly feeling that the most respectful way in which he could behave
22585: to his father was to make the painful communication as gravely and
22586: formally as possible. Moreover, the decision would be more certainly
22587: understood to be final, if the interview took place in his father’s
22588: gravest hours, which were always those spent in his private room at the
22589: warehouse.
22590: 
22591: Fred entered on the subject directly, and declared briefly what he had
22592: done and was resolved to do, expressing at the end his regret that he
22593: should be the cause of disappointment to his father, and taking the
22594: blame on his own deficiencies. The regret was genuine, and inspired
22595: Fred with strong, simple words.
22596: 
22597: Mr. Vincy listened in profound surprise without uttering even an
22598: exclamation, a silence which in his impatient temperament was a sign of
22599: unusual emotion. He had not been in good spirits about trade that
22600: morning, and the slight bitterness in his lips grew intense as he
22601: listened. When Fred had ended, there was a pause of nearly a minute,
22602: during which Mr. Vincy replaced a book in his desk and turned the key
22603: emphatically. Then he looked at his son steadily, and said—
22604: 
22605: “So you’ve made up your mind at last, sir?”
22606: 
22607: “Yes, father.”
22608: 
22609: “Very well; stick to it. I’ve no more to say. You’ve thrown away your
22610: education, and gone down a step in life, when I had given you the means
22611: of rising, that’s all.”
22612: 
22613: “I am very sorry that we differ, father. I think I can be quite as much
22614: of a gentleman at the work I have undertaken, as if I had been a
22615: curate. But I am grateful to you for wishing to do the best for me.”
22616: 
22617: “Very well; I have no more to say. I wash my hands of you. I only hope,
22618: when you have a son of your own he will make a better return for the
22619: pains you spend on him.”
22620: 
22621: This was very cutting to Fred. His father was using that unfair
22622: advantage possessed by us all when we are in a pathetic situation and
22623: see our own past as if it were simply part of the pathos. In reality,
22624: Mr. Vincy’s wishes about his son had had a great deal of pride,
22625: inconsiderateness, and egoistic folly in them. But still the
22626: disappointed father held a strong lever; and Fred felt as if he were
22627: being banished with a malediction.
22628: 
22629: “I hope you will not object to my remaining at home, sir?” he said,
22630: after rising to go; “I shall have a sufficient salary to pay for my
22631: board, as of course I should wish to do.”
22632: 
22633: “Board be hanged!” said Mr. Vincy, recovering himself in his disgust at
22634: the notion that Fred’s keep would be missed at his table. “Of course
22635: your mother will want you to stay. But I shall keep no horse for you,
22636: you understand; and you will pay your own tailor. You will do with a
22637: suit or two less, I fancy, when you have to pay for ’em.”
22638: 
22639: Fred lingered; there was still something to be said. At last it came.
22640: 
22641: “I hope you will shake hands with me, father, and forgive me the
22642: vexation I have caused you.”
22643: 
22644: Mr. Vincy from his chair threw a quick glance upward at his son, who
22645: had advanced near to him, and then gave his hand, saying hurriedly,
22646: “Yes, yes, let us say no more.”
22647: 
22648: Fred went through much more narrative and explanation with his mother,
22649: but she was inconsolable, having before her eyes what perhaps her
22650: husband had never thought of, the certainty that Fred would marry Mary
22651: Garth, that her life would henceforth be spoiled by a perpetual
22652: infusion of Garths and their ways, and that her darling boy, with his
22653: beautiful face and stylish air “beyond anybody else’s son in
22654: Middlemarch,” would be sure to get like that family in plainness of
22655: appearance and carelessness about his clothes. To her it seemed that
22656: there was a Garth conspiracy to get possession of the desirable Fred,
22657: but she dared not enlarge on this opinion, because a slight hint of it
22658: had made him “fly out” at her as he had never done before. Her temper
22659: was too sweet for her to show any anger, but she felt that her
22660: happiness had received a bruise, and for several days merely to look at
22661: Fred made her cry a little as if he were the subject of some baleful
22662: prophecy. Perhaps she was the slower to recover her usual cheerfulness
22663: because Fred had warned her that she must not reopen the sore question
22664: with his father, who had accepted his decision and forgiven him. If her
22665: husband had been vehement against Fred, she would have been urged into
22666: defence of her darling. It was the end of the fourth day when Mr. Vincy
22667: said to her—
22668: 
22669: “Come, Lucy, my dear, don’t be so down-hearted. You always have spoiled
22670: the boy, and you must go on spoiling him.”
22671: 
22672: “Nothing ever did cut me so before, Vincy,” said the wife, her fair
22673: throat and chin beginning to tremble again, “only his illness.”
22674: 
22675: “Pooh, pooh, never mind! We must expect to have trouble with our
22676: children. Don’t make it worse by letting me see you out of spirits.”
22677: 
22678: “Well, I won’t,” said Mrs. Vincy, roused by this appeal and adjusting
22679: herself with a little shake as of a bird which lays down its ruffled
22680: plumage.
22681: 
22682: “It won’t do to begin making a fuss about one,” said Mr. Vincy, wishing
22683: to combine a little grumbling with domestic cheerfulness. “There’s
22684: Rosamond as well as Fred.”
22685: 
22686: “Yes, poor thing. I’m sure I felt for her being disappointed of her
22687: baby; but she got over it nicely.”
22688: 
22689: “Baby, pooh! I can see Lydgate is making a mess of his practice, and
22690: getting into debt too, by what I hear. I shall have Rosamond coming to
22691: me with a pretty tale one of these days. But they’ll get no money from
22692: me, I know. Let _his_ family help him. I never did like that marriage.
22693: But it’s no use talking. Ring the bell for lemons, and don’t look dull
22694: any more, Lucy. I’ll drive you and Louisa to Riverston to-morrow.”
22695: 
22696: 
22697: 
22698: 
22699: CHAPTER LVII.
22700: 
22701: They numbered scarce eight summers when a name
22702:     Rose on their souls and stirred such motions there
22703: As thrill the buds and shape their hidden frame
22704:     At penetration of the quickening air:
22705: His name who told of loyal Evan Dhu,
22706:     Of quaint Bradwardine, and Vich Ian Vor,
22707: Making the little world their childhood knew
22708:     Large with a land of mountain lake and scaur,
22709: And larger yet with wonder, love, belief
22710:     Toward Walter Scott who living far away
22711: Sent them this wealth of joy and noble grief.
22712:     The book and they must part, but day by day,
22713:         In lines that thwart like portly spiders ran
22714:         They wrote the tale, from Tully Veolan.
22715: 
22716: 
22717: The evening that Fred Vincy walked to Lowick parsonage (he had begun to
22718: see that this was a world in which even a spirited young man must
22719: sometimes walk for want of a horse to carry him) he set out at five
22720: o’clock and called on Mrs. Garth by the way, wishing to assure himself
22721: that she accepted their new relations willingly.
22722: 
22723: He found the family group, dogs and cats included, under the great
22724: apple-tree in the orchard. It was a festival with Mrs. Garth, for her
22725: eldest son, Christy, her peculiar joy and pride, had come home for a
22726: short holiday—Christy, who held it the most desirable thing in the
22727: world to be a tutor, to study all literatures and be a regenerate
22728: Porson, and who was an incorporate criticism on poor Fred, a sort of
22729: object-lesson given to him by the educational mother. Christy himself,
22730: a square-browed, broad-shouldered masculine edition of his mother not
22731: much higher than Fred’s shoulder—which made it the harder that he
22732: should be held superior—was always as simple as possible, and thought
22733: no more of Fred’s disinclination to scholarship than of a giraffe’s,
22734: wishing that he himself were more of the same height. He was lying on
22735: the ground now by his mother’s chair, with his straw hat laid flat over
22736: his eyes, while Jim on the other side was reading aloud from that
22737: beloved writer who has made a chief part in the happiness of many young
22738: lives. The volume was “Ivanhoe,” and Jim was in the great archery scene
22739: at the tournament, but suffered much interruption from Ben, who had
22740: fetched his own old bow and arrows, and was making himself dreadfully
22741: disagreeable, Letty thought, by begging all present to observe his
22742: random shots, which no one wished to do except Brownie, the
22743: active-minded but probably shallow mongrel, while the grizzled
22744: Newfoundland lying in the sun looked on with the dull-eyed neutrality
22745: of extreme old age. Letty herself, showing as to her mouth and pinafore
22746: some slight signs that she had been assisting at the gathering of the
22747: cherries which stood in a coral-heap on the tea-table, was now seated
22748: on the grass, listening open-eyed to the reading.
22749: 
22750: But the centre of interest was changed for all by the arrival of Fred
22751: Vincy. When, seating himself on a garden-stool, he said that he was on
22752: his way to Lowick Parsonage, Ben, who had thrown down his bow, and
22753: snatched up a reluctant half-grown kitten instead, strode across Fred’s
22754: outstretched leg, and said “Take me!”
22755: 
22756: “Oh, and me too,” said Letty.
22757: 
22758: “You can’t keep up with Fred and me,” said Ben.
22759: 
22760: “Yes, I can. Mother, please say that I am to go,” urged Letty, whose
22761: life was much checkered by resistance to her depreciation as a girl.
22762: 
22763: “I shall stay with Christy,” observed Jim; as much as to say that he
22764: had the advantage of those simpletons; whereupon Letty put her hand up
22765: to her head and looked with jealous indecision from the one to the
22766: other.
22767: 
22768: “Let us all go and see Mary,” said Christy, opening his arms.
22769: 
22770: “No, my dear child, we must not go in a swarm to the parsonage. And
22771: that old Glasgow suit of yours would never do. Besides, your father
22772: will come home. We must let Fred go alone. He can tell Mary that you
22773: are here, and she will come back to-morrow.”
22774: 
22775: Christy glanced at his own threadbare knees, and then at Fred’s
22776: beautiful white trousers. Certainly Fred’s tailoring suggested the
22777: advantages of an English university, and he had a graceful way even of
22778: looking warm and of pushing his hair back with his handkerchief.
22779: 
22780: “Children, run away,” said Mrs. Garth; “it is too warm to hang about
22781: your friends. Take your brother and show him the rabbits.”
22782: 
22783: The eldest understood, and led off the children immediately. Fred felt
22784: that Mrs. Garth wished to give him an opportunity of saying anything he
22785: had to say, but he could only begin by observing—
22786: 
22787: “How glad you must be to have Christy here!”
22788: 
22789: “Yes; he has come sooner than I expected. He got down from the coach at
22790: nine o’clock, just after his father went out. I am longing for Caleb to
22791: come and hear what wonderful progress Christy is making. He has paid
22792: his expenses for the last year by giving lessons, carrying on hard
22793: study at the same time. He hopes soon to get a private tutorship and go
22794: abroad.”
22795: 
22796: “He is a great fellow,” said Fred, to whom these cheerful truths had a
22797: medicinal taste, “and no trouble to anybody.” After a slight pause, he
22798: added, “But I fear you will think that I am going to be a great deal of
22799: trouble to Mr. Garth.”
22800: 
22801: “Caleb likes taking trouble: he is one of those men who always do more
22802: than any one would have thought of asking them to do,” answered Mrs.
22803: Garth. She was knitting, and could either look at Fred or not, as she
22804: chose—always an advantage when one is bent on loading speech with
22805: salutary meaning; and though Mrs. Garth intended to be duly reserved,
22806: she did wish to say something that Fred might be the better for.
22807: 
22808: “I know you think me very undeserving, Mrs. Garth, and with good
22809: reason,” said Fred, his spirit rising a little at the perception of
22810: something like a disposition to lecture him. “I happen to have behaved
22811: just the worst to the people I can’t help wishing for the most from.
22812: But while two men like Mr. Garth and Mr. Farebrother have not given me
22813: up, I don’t see why I should give myself up.” Fred thought it might be
22814: well to suggest these masculine examples to Mrs. Garth.
22815: 
22816: “Assuredly,” said she, with gathering emphasis. “A young man for whom
22817: two such elders had devoted themselves would indeed be culpable if he
22818: threw himself away and made their sacrifices vain.”
22819: 
22820: Fred wondered a little at this strong language, but only said, “I hope
22821: it will not be so with me, Mrs. Garth, since I have some encouragement
22822: to believe that I may win Mary. Mr. Garth has told you about that? You
22823: were not surprised, I dare say?” Fred ended, innocently referring only
22824: to his own love as probably evident enough.
22825: 
22826: “Not surprised that Mary has given you encouragement?” returned Mrs.
22827: Garth, who thought it would be well for Fred to be more alive to the
22828: fact that Mary’s friends could not possibly have wished this
22829: beforehand, whatever the Vincys might suppose. “Yes, I confess I was
22830: surprised.”
22831: 
22832: “She never did give me any—not the least in the world, when I talked to
22833: her myself,” said Fred, eager to vindicate Mary. “But when I asked Mr.
22834: Farebrother to speak for me, she allowed him to tell me there was a
22835: hope.”
22836: 
22837: The power of admonition which had begun to stir in Mrs. Garth had not
22838: yet discharged itself. It was a little too provoking even for _her_
22839: self-control that this blooming youngster should flourish on the
22840: disappointments of sadder and wiser people—making a meal of a
22841: nightingale and never knowing it—and that all the while his family
22842: should suppose that hers was in eager need of this sprig; and her
22843: vexation had fermented the more actively because of its total
22844: repression towards her husband. Exemplary wives will sometimes find
22845: scapegoats in this way. She now said with energetic decision, “You made
22846: a great mistake, Fred, in asking Mr. Farebrother to speak for you.”
22847: 
22848: “Did I?” said Fred, reddening instantaneously. He was alarmed, but at a
22849: loss to know what Mrs. Garth meant, and added, in an apologetic tone,
22850: “Mr. Farebrother has always been such a friend of ours; and Mary, I
22851: knew, would listen to him gravely; and he took it on himself quite
22852: readily.”
22853: 
22854: “Yes, young people are usually blind to everything but their own
22855: wishes, and seldom imagine how much those wishes cost others,” said
22856: Mrs. Garth. She did not mean to go beyond this salutary general
22857: doctrine, and threw her indignation into a needless unwinding of her
22858: worsted, knitting her brow at it with a grand air.
22859: 
22860: “I cannot conceive how it could be any pain to Mr. Farebrother,” said
22861: Fred, who nevertheless felt that surprising conceptions were beginning
22862: to form themselves.
22863: 
22864: “Precisely; you cannot conceive,” said Mrs. Garth, cutting her words as
22865: neatly as possible.
22866: 
22867: For a moment Fred looked at the horizon with a dismayed anxiety, and
22868: then turning with a quick movement said almost sharply—
22869: 
22870: “Do you mean to say, Mrs. Garth, that Mr. Farebrother is in love with
22871: Mary?”
22872: 
22873: “And if it were so, Fred, I think you are the last person who ought to
22874: be surprised,” returned Mrs. Garth, laying her knitting down beside her
22875: and folding her arms. It was an unwonted sign of emotion in her that
22876: she should put her work out of her hands. In fact her feelings were
22877: divided between the satisfaction of giving Fred his discipline and the
22878: sense of having gone a little too far. Fred took his hat and stick and
22879: rose quickly.
22880: 
22881: “Then you think I am standing in his way, and in Mary’s too?” he said,
22882: in a tone which seemed to demand an answer.
22883: 
22884: Mrs. Garth could not speak immediately. She had brought herself into
22885: the unpleasant position of being called on to say what she really felt,
22886: yet what she knew there were strong reasons for concealing. And to her
22887: the consciousness of having exceeded in words was peculiarly
22888: mortifying. Besides, Fred had given out unexpected electricity, and he
22889: now added, “Mr. Garth seemed pleased that Mary should be attached to
22890: me. He could not have known anything of this.”
22891: 
22892: Mrs. Garth felt a severe twinge at this mention of her husband, the
22893: fear that Caleb might think her in the wrong not being easily
22894: endurable. She answered, wanting to check unintended consequences—
22895: 
22896: “I spoke from inference only. I am not aware that Mary knows anything
22897: of the matter.”
22898: 
22899: But she hesitated to beg that he would keep entire silence on a subject
22900: which she had herself unnecessarily mentioned, not being used to stoop
22901: in that way; and while she was hesitating there was already a rush of
22902: unintended consequences under the apple-tree where the tea-things
22903: stood. Ben, bouncing across the grass with Brownie at his heels, and
22904: seeing the kitten dragging the knitting by a lengthening line of wool,
22905: shouted and clapped his hands; Brownie barked, the kitten, desperate,
22906: jumped on the tea-table and upset the milk, then jumped down again and
22907: swept half the cherries with it; and Ben, snatching up the half-knitted
22908: sock-top, fitted it over the kitten’s head as a new source of madness,
22909: while Letty arriving cried out to her mother against this cruelty—it
22910: was a history as full of sensation as “This is the house that Jack
22911: built.” Mrs. Garth was obliged to interfere, the other young ones came
22912: up and the _tête-à-tête_ with Fred was ended. He got away as soon as he
22913: could, and Mrs. Garth could only imply some retractation of her
22914: severity by saying “God bless you” when she shook hands with him.
22915: 
22916: She was unpleasantly conscious that she had been on the verge of
22917: speaking as “one of the foolish women speaketh”—telling first and
22918: entreating silence after. But she had not entreated silence, and to
22919: prevent Caleb’s blame she determined to blame herself and confess all
22920: to him that very night. It was curious what an awful tribunal the mild
22921: Caleb’s was to her, whenever he set it up. But she meant to point out
22922: to him that the revelation might do Fred Vincy a great deal of good.
22923: 
22924: No doubt it was having a strong effect on him as he walked to Lowick.
22925: Fred’s light hopeful nature had perhaps never had so much of a bruise
22926: as from this suggestion that if he had been out of the way Mary might
22927: have made a thoroughly good match. Also he was piqued that he had been
22928: what he called such a stupid lout as to ask that intervention from Mr.
22929: Farebrother. But it was not in a lover’s nature—it was not in Fred’s,
22930: that the new anxiety raised about Mary’s feeling should not surmount
22931: every other. Notwithstanding his trust in Mr. Farebrother’s generosity,
22932: notwithstanding what Mary had said to him, Fred could not help feeling
22933: that he had a rival: it was a new consciousness, and he objected to it
22934: extremely, not being in the least ready to give up Mary for her good,
22935: being ready rather to fight for her with any man whatsoever. But the
22936: fighting with Mr. Farebrother must be of a metaphorical kind, which was
22937: much more difficult to Fred than the muscular. Certainly this
22938: experience was a discipline for Fred hardly less sharp than his
22939: disappointment about his uncle’s will. The iron had not entered into
22940: his soul, but he had begun to imagine what the sharp edge would be. It
22941: did not once occur to Fred that Mrs. Garth might be mistaken about Mr.
22942: Farebrother, but he suspected that she might be wrong about Mary. Mary
22943: had been staying at the parsonage lately, and her mother might know
22944: very little of what had been passing in her mind.
22945: 
22946: He did not feel easier when he found her looking cheerful with the
22947: three ladies in the drawing-room. They were in animated discussion on
22948: some subject which was dropped when he entered, and Mary was copying
22949: the labels from a heap of shallow cabinet drawers, in a minute
22950: handwriting which she was skilled in. Mr. Farebrother was somewhere in
22951: the village, and the three ladies knew nothing of Fred’s peculiar
22952: relation to Mary: it was impossible for either of them to propose that
22953: they should walk round the garden, and Fred predicted to himself that
22954: he should have to go away without saying a word to her in private. He
22955: told her first of Christy’s arrival and then of his own engagement with
22956: her father; and he was comforted by seeing that this latter news
22957: touched her keenly. She said hurriedly, “I am so glad,” and then bent
22958: over her writing to hinder any one from noticing her face. But here was
22959: a subject which Mrs. Farebrother could not let pass.
22960: 
22961: “You don’t mean, my dear Miss Garth, that you are glad to hear of a
22962: young man giving up the Church for which he was educated: you only mean
22963: that things being so, you are glad that he should be under an excellent
22964: man like your father.”
22965: 
22966: “No, really, Mrs. Farebrother, I am glad of both, I fear,” said Mary,
22967: cleverly getting rid of one rebellious tear. “I have a dreadfully
22968: secular mind. I never liked any clergyman except the Vicar of Wakefield
22969: and Mr. Farebrother.”
22970: 
22971: “Now why, my dear?” said Mrs. Farebrother, pausing on her large wooden
22972: knitting-needles and looking at Mary. “You have always a good reason
22973: for your opinions, but this astonishes me. Of course I put out of the
22974: question those who preach new doctrine. But why should you dislike
22975: clergymen?”
22976: 
22977: “Oh dear,” said Mary, her face breaking into merriment as she seemed to
22978: consider a moment, “I don’t like their neckcloths.”
22979: 
22980: “Why, you don’t like Camden’s, then,” said Miss Winifred, in some
22981: anxiety.
22982: 
22983: “Yes, I do,” said Mary. “I don’t like the other clergymen’s neckcloths,
22984: because it is they who wear them.”
22985: 
22986: “How very puzzling!” said Miss Noble, feeling that her own intellect
22987: was probably deficient.
22988: 
22989: “My dear, you are joking. You would have better reasons than these for
22990: slighting so respectable a class of men,” said Mrs. Farebrother,
22991: majestically.
22992: 
22993: “Miss Garth has such severe notions of what people should be that it is
22994: difficult to satisfy her,” said Fred.
22995: 
22996: “Well, I am glad at least that she makes an exception in favor of my
22997: son,” said the old lady.
22998: 
22999: Mary was wondering at Fred’s piqued tone, when Mr. Farebrother came in
23000: and had to hear the news about the engagement under Mr. Garth. At the
23001: end he said with quiet satisfaction, “_That_ is right;” and then bent
23002: to look at Mary’s labels and praise her handwriting. Fred felt horribly
23003: jealous—was glad, of course, that Mr. Farebrother was so estimable, but
23004: wished that he had been ugly and fat as men at forty sometimes are. It
23005: was clear what the end would be, since Mary openly placed Farebrother
23006: above everybody, and these women were all evidently encouraging the
23007: affair. He was feeling sure that he should have no chance of speaking
23008: to Mary, when Mr. Farebrother said—
23009: 
23010: “Fred, help me to carry these drawers back into my study—you have never
23011: seen my fine new study. Pray come too, Miss Garth. I want you to see a
23012: stupendous spider I found this morning.”
23013: 
23014: Mary at once saw the Vicar’s intention. He had never since the
23015: memorable evening deviated from his old pastoral kindness towards her,
23016: and her momentary wonder and doubt had quite gone to sleep. Mary was
23017: accustomed to think rather rigorously of what was probable, and if a
23018: belief flattered her vanity she felt warned to dismiss it as
23019: ridiculous, having early had much exercise in such dismissals. It was
23020: as she had foreseen: when Fred had been asked to admire the fittings of
23021: the study, and she had been asked to admire the spider, Mr. Farebrother
23022: said—
23023: 
23024: “Wait here a minute or two. I am going to look out an engraving which
23025: Fred is tall enough to hang for me. I shall be back in a few minutes.”
23026: And then he went out. Nevertheless, the first word Fred said to Mary
23027: was—
23028: 
23029: “It is of no use, whatever I do, Mary. You are sure to marry
23030: Farebrother at last.” There was some rage in his tone.
23031: 
23032: “What do you mean, Fred?” Mary exclaimed indignantly, blushing deeply,
23033: and surprised out of all her readiness in reply.
23034: 
23035: “It is impossible that you should not see it all clearly enough—you who
23036: see everything.”
23037: 
23038: “I only see that you are behaving very ill, Fred, in speaking so of Mr.
23039: Farebrother after he has pleaded your cause in every way. How can you
23040: have taken up such an idea?”
23041: 
23042: Fred was rather deep, in spite of his irritation. If Mary had really
23043: been unsuspicious, there was no good in telling her what Mrs. Garth had
23044: said.
23045: 
23046: “It follows as a matter of course,” he replied. “When you are
23047: continually seeing a man who beats me in everything, and whom you set
23048: up above everybody, I can have no fair chance.”
23049: 
23050: “You are very ungrateful, Fred,” said Mary. “I wish I had never told
23051: Mr. Farebrother that I cared for you in the least.”
23052: 
23053: “No, I am not ungrateful; I should be the happiest fellow in the world
23054: if it were not for this. I told your father everything, and he was very
23055: kind; he treated me as if I were his son. I could go at the work with a
23056: will, writing and everything, if it were not for this.”
23057: 
23058: “For this? for what?” said Mary, imagining now that something specific
23059: must have been said or done.
23060: 
23061: “This dreadful certainty that I shall be bowled out by Farebrother.”
23062: Mary was appeased by her inclination to laugh.
23063: 
23064: “Fred,” she said, peeping round to catch his eyes, which were sulkily
23065: turned away from her, “you are too delightfully ridiculous. If you were
23066: not such a charming simpleton, what a temptation this would be to play
23067: the wicked coquette, and let you suppose that somebody besides you has
23068: made love to me.”
23069: 
23070: “Do you really like me best, Mary?” said Fred, turning eyes full of
23071: affection on her, and trying to take her hand.
23072: 
23073: “I don’t like you at all at this moment,” said Mary, retreating, and
23074: putting her hands behind her. “I only said that no mortal ever made
23075: love to me besides you. And that is no argument that a very wise man
23076: ever will,” she ended, merrily.
23077: 
23078: “I wish you would tell me that you could not possibly ever think of
23079: him,” said Fred.
23080: 
23081: “Never dare to mention this any more to me, Fred,” said Mary, getting
23082: serious again. “I don’t know whether it is more stupid or ungenerous in
23083: you not to see that Mr. Farebrother has left us together on purpose
23084: that we might speak freely. I am disappointed that you should be so
23085: blind to his delicate feeling.”
23086: 
23087: There was no time to say any more before Mr. Farebrother came back with
23088: the engraving; and Fred had to return to the drawing-room still with a
23089: jealous dread in his heart, but yet with comforting arguments from
23090: Mary’s words and manner. The result of the conversation was on the
23091: whole more painful to Mary: inevitably her attention had taken a new
23092: attitude, and she saw the possibility of new interpretations. She was
23093: in a position in which she seemed to herself to be slighting Mr.
23094: Farebrother, and this, in relation to a man who is much honored, is
23095: always dangerous to the firmness of a grateful woman. To have a reason
23096: for going home the next day was a relief, for Mary earnestly desired to
23097: be always clear that she loved Fred best. When a tender affection has
23098: been storing itself in us through many of our years, the idea that we
23099: could accept any exchange for it seems to be a cheapening of our lives.
23100: And we can set a watch over our affections and our constancy as we can
23101: over other treasures.
23102: 
23103: “Fred has lost all his other expectations; he must keep this,” Mary
23104: said to herself, with a smile curling her lips. It was impossible to
23105: help fleeting visions of another kind—new dignities and an acknowledged
23106: value of which she had often felt the absence. But these things with
23107: Fred outside them, Fred forsaken and looking sad for the want of her,
23108: could never tempt her deliberate thought.
23109:

23112: 
23113: CHAPTER LVIII.
23114: 
23115: “For there can live no hatred in thine eye,
23116: Therefore in that I cannot know thy change:
23117: In many’s looks the false heart’s history
23118: Is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange:
23119: But Heaven in thy creation did decree
23120: That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell:
23121: Whate’er thy thoughts or thy heart’s workings be
23122: Thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell.”
23123: —SHAKESPEARE: _Sonnets_.
23124: 
23125: 
23126: At the time when Mr. Vincy uttered that presentiment about Rosamond,
23127: she herself had never had the idea that she should be driven to make
23128: the sort of appeal which he foresaw. She had not yet had any anxiety
23129: about ways and means, although her domestic life had been expensive as
23130: well as eventful. Her baby had been born prematurely, and all the
23131: embroidered robes and caps had to be laid by in darkness. This
23132: misfortune was attributed entirely to her having persisted in going out
23133: on horseback one day when her husband had desired her not to do so; but
23134: it must not be supposed that she had shown temper on the occasion, or
23135: rudely told him that she would do as she liked.
23136: 
23137: What led her particularly to desire horse-exercise was a visit from
23138: Captain Lydgate, the baronet’s third son, who, I am sorry to say, was
23139: detested by our Tertius of that name as a vapid fop “parting his hair
23140: from brow to nape in a despicable fashion” (not followed by Tertius
23141: himself), and showing an ignorant security that he knew the proper
23142: thing to say on every topic. Lydgate inwardly cursed his own folly that
23143: he had drawn down this visit by consenting to go to his uncle’s on the
23144: wedding-tour, and he made himself rather disagreeable to Rosamond by
23145: saying so in private. For to Rosamond this visit was a source of
23146: unprecedented but gracefully concealed exultation. She was so intensely
23147: conscious of having a cousin who was a baronet’s son staying in the
23148: house, that she imagined the knowledge of what was implied by his
23149: presence to be diffused through all other minds; and when she
23150: introduced Captain Lydgate to her guests, she had a placid sense that
23151: his rank penetrated them as if it had been an odor. The satisfaction
23152: was enough for the time to melt away some disappointment in the
23153: conditions of marriage with a medical man even of good birth: it seemed
23154: now that her marriage was visibly as well as ideally floating her above
23155: the Middlemarch level, and the future looked bright with letters and
23156: visits to and from Quallingham, and vague advancement in consequence
23157: for Tertius. Especially as, probably at the Captain’s suggestion, his
23158: married sister, Mrs. Mengan, had come with her maid, and stayed two
23159: nights on her way from town. Hence it was clearly worth while for
23160: Rosamond to take pains with her music and the careful selection of her
23161: lace.
23162: 
23163: As to Captain Lydgate himself, his low brow, his aquiline nose bent on
23164: one side, and his rather heavy utterance, might have been
23165: disadvantageous in any young gentleman who had not a military bearing
23166: and mustache to give him what is doted on by some flower-like blond
23167: heads as “style.” He had, moreover, that sort of high-breeding which
23168: consists in being free from the petty solicitudes of middle-class
23169: gentility, and he was a great critic of feminine charms. Rosamond
23170: delighted in his admiration now even more than she had done at
23171: Quallingham, and he found it easy to spend several hours of the day in
23172: flirting with her. The visit altogether was one of the pleasantest
23173: larks he had ever had, not the less so perhaps because he suspected
23174: that his queer cousin Tertius wished him away: though Lydgate, who
23175: would rather (hyperbolically speaking) have died than have failed in
23176: polite hospitality, suppressed his dislike, and only pretended
23177: generally not to hear what the gallant officer said, consigning the
23178: task of answering him to Rosamond. For he was not at all a jealous
23179: husband, and preferred leaving a feather-headed young gentleman alone
23180: with his wife to bearing him company.
23181: 
23182: “I wish you would talk more to the Captain at dinner, Tertius,” said
23183: Rosamond, one evening when the important guest was gone to Loamford to
23184: see some brother officers stationed there. “You really look so absent
23185: sometimes—you seem to be seeing through his head into something behind
23186: it, instead of looking at him.”
23187: 
23188: “My dear Rosy, you don’t expect me to talk much to such a conceited ass
23189: as that, I hope,” said Lydgate, brusquely. “If he got his head broken,
23190: I might look at it with interest, not before.”
23191: 
23192: “I cannot conceive why you should speak of your cousin so
23193: contemptuously,” said Rosamond, her fingers moving at her work while
23194: she spoke with a mild gravity which had a touch of disdain in it.
23195: 
23196: “Ask Ladislaw if he doesn’t think your Captain the greatest bore he
23197: ever met with. Ladislaw has almost forsaken the house since he came.”
23198: 
23199: Rosamond thought she knew perfectly well why Mr. Ladislaw disliked the
23200: Captain: he was jealous, and she liked his being jealous.
23201: 
23202: “It is impossible to say what will suit eccentric persons,” she
23203: answered, “but in my opinion Captain Lydgate is a thorough gentleman,
23204: and I think you ought not, out of respect to Sir Godwin, to treat him
23205: with neglect.”
23206: 
23207: “No, dear; but we have had dinners for him. And he comes in and goes
23208: out as he likes. He doesn’t want me.”
23209: 
23210: “Still, when he is in the room, you might show him more attention. He
23211: may not be a phoenix of cleverness in your sense; his profession is
23212: different; but it would be all the better for you to talk a little on
23213: his subjects. _I_ think his conversation is quite agreeable. And he is
23214: anything but an unprincipled man.”
23215: 
23216: “The fact is, you would wish me to be a little more like him, Rosy,”
23217: said Lydgate, in a sort of resigned murmur, with a smile which was not
23218: exactly tender, and certainly not merry. Rosamond was silent and did
23219: not smile again; but the lovely curves of her face looked good-tempered
23220: enough without smiling.
23221: 
23222: Those words of Lydgate’s were like a sad milestone marking how far he
23223: had travelled from his old dreamland, in which Rosamond Vincy appeared
23224: to be that perfect piece of womanhood who would reverence her husband’s
23225: mind after the fashion of an accomplished mermaid, using her comb and
23226: looking-glass and singing her song for the relaxation of his adored
23227: wisdom alone. He had begun to distinguish between that imagined
23228: adoration and the attraction towards a man’s talent because it gives
23229: him prestige, and is like an order in his button-hole or an Honorable
23230: before his name.
23231: 
23232: It might have been supposed that Rosamond had travelled too, since she
23233: had found the pointless conversation of Mr. Ned Plymdale perfectly
23234: wearisome; but to most mortals there is a stupidity which is
23235: unendurable and a stupidity which is altogether acceptable—else,
23236: indeed, what would become of social bonds? Captain Lydgate’s stupidity
23237: was delicately scented, carried itself with “style,” talked with a good
23238: accent, and was closely related to Sir Godwin. Rosamond found it quite
23239: agreeable and caught many of its phrases.
23240: 
23241: Therefore since Rosamond, as we know, was fond of horseback, there were
23242: plenty of reasons why she should be tempted to resume her riding when
23243: Captain Lydgate, who had ordered his man with two horses to follow him
23244: and put up at the “Green Dragon,” begged her to go out on the gray
23245: which he warranted to be gentle and trained to carry a lady—indeed, he
23246: had bought it for his sister, and was taking it to Quallingham.
23247: Rosamond went out the first time without telling her husband, and came
23248: back before his return; but the ride had been so thorough a success,
23249: and she declared herself so much the better in consequence, that he was
23250: informed of it with full reliance on his consent that she should go
23251: riding again.
23252: 
23253: On the contrary Lydgate was more than hurt—he was utterly confounded
23254: that she had risked herself on a strange horse without referring the
23255: matter to his wish. After the first almost thundering exclamations of
23256: astonishment, which sufficiently warned Rosamond of what was coming, he
23257: was silent for some moments.
23258: 
23259: “However, you have come back safely,” he said, at last, in a decisive
23260: tone. “You will not go again, Rosy; that is understood. If it were the
23261: quietest, most familiar horse in the world, there would always be the
23262: chance of accident. And you know very well that I wished you to give up
23263: riding the roan on that account.”
23264: 
23265: “But there is the chance of accident indoors, Tertius.”
23266: 
23267: “My darling, don’t talk nonsense,” said Lydgate, in an imploring tone;
23268: “surely I am the person to judge for you. I think it is enough that I
23269: say you are not to go again.”
23270: 
23271: Rosamond was arranging her hair before dinner, and the reflection of
23272: her head in the glass showed no change in its loveliness except a
23273: little turning aside of the long neck. Lydgate had been moving about
23274: with his hands in his pockets, and now paused near her, as if he
23275: awaited some assurance.
23276: 
23277: “I wish you would fasten up my plaits, dear,” said Rosamond, letting
23278: her arms fall with a little sigh, so as to make a husband ashamed of
23279: standing there like a brute. Lydgate had often fastened the plaits
23280: before, being among the deftest of men with his large finely formed
23281: fingers. He swept up the soft festoons of plaits and fastened in the
23282: tall comb (to such uses do men come!); and what could he do then but
23283: kiss the exquisite nape which was shown in all its delicate curves? But
23284: when we do what we have done before, it is often with a difference.
23285: Lydgate was still angry, and had not forgotten his point.
23286: 
23287: “I shall tell the Captain that he ought to have known better than offer
23288: you his horse,” he said, as he moved away.
23289: 
23290: “I beg you will not do anything of the kind, Tertius,” said Rosamond,
23291: looking at him with something more marked than usual in her speech. “It
23292: will be treating me as if I were a child. Promise that you will leave
23293: the subject to me.”
23294: 
23295: There did seem to be some truth in her objection. Lydgate said, “Very
23296: well,” with a surly obedience, and thus the discussion ended with his
23297: promising Rosamond, and not with her promising him.
23298: 
23299: In fact, she had been determined not to promise. Rosamond had that
23300: victorious obstinacy which never wastes its energy in impetuous
23301: resistance. What she liked to do was to her the right thing, and all
23302: her cleverness was directed to getting the means of doing it. She meant
23303: to go out riding again on the gray, and she did go on the next
23304: opportunity of her husband’s absence, not intending that he should know
23305: until it was late enough not to signify to her. The temptation was
23306: certainly great: she was very fond of the exercise, and the
23307: gratification of riding on a fine horse, with Captain Lydgate, Sir
23308: Godwin’s son, on another fine horse by her side, and of being met in
23309: this position by any one but her husband, was something as good as her
23310: dreams before marriage: moreover she was riveting the connection with
23311: the family at Quallingham, which must be a wise thing to do.
23312: 
23313: But the gentle gray, unprepared for the crash of a tree that was being
23314: felled on the edge of Halsell wood, took fright, and caused a worse
23315: fright to Rosamond, leading finally to the loss of her baby. Lydgate
23316: could not show his anger towards her, but he was rather bearish to the
23317: Captain, whose visit naturally soon came to an end.
23318: 
23319: In all future conversations on the subject, Rosamond was mildly certain
23320: that the ride had made no difference, and that if she had stayed at
23321: home the same symptoms would have come on and would have ended in the
23322: same way, because she had felt something like them before.
23323: 
23324: Lydgate could only say, “Poor, poor darling!”—but he secretly wondered
23325: over the terrible tenacity of this mild creature. There was gathering
23326: within him an amazed sense of his powerlessness over Rosamond. His
23327: superior knowledge and mental force, instead of being, as he had
23328: imagined, a shrine to consult on all occasions, was simply set aside on
23329: every practical question. He had regarded Rosamond’s cleverness as
23330: precisely of the receptive kind which became a woman. He was now
23331: beginning to find out what that cleverness was—what was the shape into
23332: which it had run as into a close network aloof and independent. No one
23333: quicker than Rosamond to see causes and effects which lay within the
23334: track of her own tastes and interests: she had seen clearly Lydgate’s
23335: preeminence in Middlemarch society, and could go on imaginatively
23336: tracing still more agreeable social effects when his talent should have
23337: advanced him; but for her, his professional and scientific ambition had
23338: no other relation to these desirable effects than if they had been the
23339: fortunate discovery of an ill-smelling oil. And that oil apart, with
23340: which she had nothing to do, of course she believed in her own opinion
23341: more than she did in his. Lydgate was astounded to find in numberless
23342: trifling matters, as well as in this last serious case of the riding,
23343: that affection did not make her compliant. He had no doubt that the
23344: affection was there, and had no presentiment that he had done anything
23345: to repel it. For his own part he said to himself that he loved her as
23346: tenderly as ever, and could make up his mind to her negations;
23347: but—well! Lydgate was much worried, and conscious of new elements in
23348: his life as noxious to him as an inlet of mud to a creature that has
23349: been used to breathe and bathe and dart after its illuminated prey in
23350: the clearest of waters.
23351: 
23352: Rosamond was soon looking lovelier than ever at her worktable, enjoying
23353: drives in her father’s phaeton and thinking it likely that she might be
23354: invited to Quallingham. She knew that she was a much more exquisite
23355: ornament to the drawing-room there than any daughter of the family, and
23356: in reflecting that the gentlemen were aware of that, did not perhaps
23357: sufficiently consider whether the ladies would be eager to see
23358: themselves surpassed.
23359: 
23360: Lydgate, relieved from anxiety about her, relapsed into what she
23361: inwardly called his moodiness—a name which to her covered his
23362: thoughtful preoccupation with other subjects than herself, as well as
23363: that uneasy look of the brow and distaste for all ordinary things as if
23364: they were mixed with bitter herbs, which really made a sort of
23365: weather-glass to his vexation and foreboding. These latter states of
23366: mind had one cause amongst others, which he had generously but
23367: mistakenly avoided mentioning to Rosamond, lest it should affect her
23368: health and spirits. Between him and her indeed there was that total
23369: missing of each other’s mental track, which is too evidently possible
23370: even between persons who are continually thinking of each other. To
23371: Lydgate it seemed that he had been spending month after month in
23372: sacrificing more than half of his best intent and best power to his
23373: tenderness for Rosamond; bearing her little claims and interruptions
23374: without impatience, and, above all, bearing without betrayal of
23375: bitterness to look through less and less of interfering illusion at the
23376: blank unreflecting surface her mind presented to his ardor for the more
23377: impersonal ends of his profession and his scientific study, an ardor
23378: which he had fancied that the ideal wife must somehow worship as
23379: sublime, though not in the least knowing why. But his endurance was
23380: mingled with a self-discontent which, if we know how to be candid, we
23381: shall confess to make more than half our bitterness under grievances,
23382: wife or husband included. It always remains true that if we had been
23383: greater, circumstance would have been less strong against us. Lydgate
23384: was aware that his concessions to Rosamond were often little more than
23385: the lapse of slackening resolution, the creeping paralysis apt to seize
23386: an enthusiasm which is out of adjustment to a constant portion of our
23387: lives. And on Lydgate’s enthusiasm there was constantly pressing not a
23388: simple weight of sorrow, but the biting presence of a petty degrading
23389: care, such as casts the blight of irony over all higher effort.
23390: 
23391: This was the care which he had hitherto abstained from mentioning to
23392: Rosamond; and he believed, with some wonder, that it had never entered
23393: her mind, though certainly no difficulty could be less mysterious. It
23394: was an inference with a conspicuous handle to it, and had been easily
23395: drawn by indifferent observers, that Lydgate was in debt; and he could
23396: not succeed in keeping out of his mind for long together that he was
23397: every day getting deeper into that swamp, which tempts men towards it
23398: with such a pretty covering of flowers and verdure. It is wonderful how
23399: soon a man gets up to his chin there—in a condition in which, in spite
23400: of himself, he is forced to think chiefly of release, though he had a
23401: scheme of the universe in his soul.
23402: 
23403: Eighteen months ago Lydgate was poor, but had never known the eager
23404: want of small sums, and felt rather a burning contempt for any one who
23405: descended a step in order to gain them. He was now experiencing
23406: something worse than a simple deficit: he was assailed by the vulgar
23407: hateful trials of a man who has bought and used a great many things
23408: which might have been done without, and which he is unable to pay for,
23409: though the demand for payment has become pressing.
23410: 
23411: How this came about may be easily seen without much arithmetic or
23412: knowledge of prices. When a man in setting up a house and preparing for
23413: marriage finds that his furniture and other initial expenses come to
23414: between four and five hundred pounds more than he has capital to pay
23415: for; when at the end of a year it appears that his household expenses,
23416: horses and et caeteras, amount to nearly a thousand, while the proceeds
23417: of the practice reckoned from the old books to be worth eight hundred
23418: per annum have sunk like a summer pond and make hardly five hundred,
23419: chiefly in unpaid entries, the plain inference is that, whether he
23420: minds it or not, he is in debt. Those were less expensive times than
23421: our own, and provincial life was comparatively modest; but the ease
23422: with which a medical man who had lately bought a practice, who thought
23423: that he was obliged to keep two horses, whose table was supplied
23424: without stint, and who paid an insurance on his life and a high rent
23425: for house and garden, might find his expenses doubling his receipts,
23426: can be conceived by any one who does not think these details beneath
23427: his consideration. Rosamond, accustomed from her childhood to an
23428: extravagant household, thought that good housekeeping consisted simply
23429: in ordering the best of everything—nothing else “answered;” and Lydgate
23430: supposed that “if things were done at all, they must be done
23431: properly”—he did not see how they were to live otherwise. If each head
23432: of household expenditure had been mentioned to him beforehand, he would
23433: have probably observed that “it could hardly come to much,” and if any
23434: one had suggested a saving on a particular article—for example, the
23435: substitution of cheap fish for dear—it would have appeared to him
23436: simply a penny-wise, mean notion. Rosamond, even without such an
23437: occasion as Captain Lydgate’s visit, was fond of giving invitations,
23438: and Lydgate, though he often thought the guests tiresome, did not
23439: interfere. This sociability seemed a necessary part of professional
23440: prudence, and the entertainment must be suitable. It is true Lydgate
23441: was constantly visiting the homes of the poor and adjusting his
23442: prescriptions of diet to their small means; but, dear me! has it not by
23443: this time ceased to be remarkable—is it not rather that we expect in
23444: men, that they should have numerous strands of experience lying side by
23445: side and never compare them with each other? Expenditure—like ugliness
23446: and errors—becomes a totally new thing when we attach our own
23447: personality to it, and measure it by that wide difference which is
23448: manifest (in our own sensations) between ourselves and others. Lydgate
23449: believed himself to be careless about his dress, and he despised a man
23450: who calculated the effects of his costume; it seemed to him only a
23451: matter of course that he had abundance of fresh garments—such things
23452: were naturally ordered in sheaves. It must be remembered that he had
23453: never hitherto felt the check of importunate debt, and he walked by
23454: habit, not by self-criticism. But the check had come.
23455: 
23456: Its novelty made it the more irritating. He was amazed, disgusted that
23457: conditions so foreign to all his purposes, so hatefully disconnected
23458: with the objects he cared to occupy himself with, should have lain in
23459: ambush and clutched him when he was unaware. And there was not only the
23460: actual debt; there was the certainty that in his present position he
23461: must go on deepening it. Two furnishing tradesmen at Brassing, whose
23462: bills had been incurred before his marriage, and whom uncalculated
23463: current expenses had ever since prevented him from paying, had
23464: repeatedly sent him unpleasant letters which had forced themselves on
23465: his attention. This could hardly have been more galling to any
23466: disposition than to Lydgate’s, with his intense pride—his dislike of
23467: asking a favor or being under an obligation to any one. He had scorned
23468: even to form conjectures about Mr. Vincy’s intentions on money matters,
23469: and nothing but extremity could have induced him to apply to his
23470: father-in-law, even if he had not been made aware in various indirect
23471: ways since his marriage that Mr. Vincy’s own affairs were not
23472: flourishing, and that the expectation of help from him would be
23473: resented. Some men easily trust in the readiness of friends; it had
23474: never in the former part of his life occurred to Lydgate that he should
23475: need to do so: he had never thought what borrowing would be to him; but
23476: now that the idea had entered his mind, he felt that he would rather
23477: incur any other hardship. In the mean time he had no money or prospects
23478: of money; and his practice was not getting more lucrative.
23479: 
23480: No wonder that Lydgate had been unable to suppress all signs of inward
23481: trouble during the last few months, and now that Rosamond was regaining
23482: brilliant health, he meditated taking her entirely into confidence on
23483: his difficulties. New conversance with tradesmen’s bills had forced his
23484: reasoning into a new channel of comparison: he had begun to consider
23485: from a new point of view what was necessary and unnecessary in goods
23486: ordered, and to see that there must be some change of habits. How could
23487: such a change be made without Rosamond’s concurrence? The immediate
23488: occasion of opening the disagreeable fact to her was forced upon him.
23489: 
23490: Having no money, and having privately sought advice as to what security
23491: could possibly be given by a man in his position, Lydgate had offered
23492: the one good security in his power to the less peremptory creditor, who
23493: was a silversmith and jeweller, and who consented to take on himself
23494: the upholsterer’s credit also, accepting interest for a given term. The
23495: security necessary was a bill of sale on the furniture of his house,
23496: which might make a creditor easy for a reasonable time about a debt
23497: amounting to less than four hundred pounds; and the silversmith, Mr.
23498: Dover, was willing to reduce it by taking back a portion of the plate
23499: and any other article which was as good as new. “Any other article” was
23500: a phrase delicately implying jewellery, and more particularly some
23501: purple amethysts costing thirty pounds, which Lydgate had bought as a
23502: bridal present.
23503: 
23504: Opinions may be divided as to his wisdom in making this present: some
23505: may think that it was a graceful attention to be expected from a man
23506: like Lydgate, and that the fault of any troublesome consequences lay in
23507: the pinched narrowness of provincial life at that time, which offered
23508: no conveniences for professional people whose fortune was not
23509: proportioned to their tastes; also, in Lydgate’s ridiculous
23510: fastidiousness about asking his friends for money.
23511: 
23512: However, it had seemed a question of no moment to him on that fine
23513: morning when he went to give a final order for plate: in the presence
23514: of other jewels enormously expensive, and as an addition to orders of
23515: which the amount had not been exactly calculated, thirty pounds for
23516: ornaments so exquisitely suited to Rosamond’s neck and arms could
23517: hardly appear excessive when there was no ready cash for it to exceed.
23518: But at this crisis Lydgate’s imagination could not help dwelling on the
23519: possibility of letting the amethysts take their place again among Mr.
23520: Dover’s stock, though he shrank from the idea of proposing this to
23521: Rosamond. Having been roused to discern consequences which he had never
23522: been in the habit of tracing, he was preparing to act on this
23523: discernment with some of the rigor (by no means all) that he would have
23524: applied in pursuing experiment. He was nerving himself to this rigor as
23525: he rode from Brassing, and meditated on the representations he must
23526: make to Rosamond.
23527: 
23528: It was evening when he got home. He was intensely miserable, this
23529: strong man of nine-and-twenty and of many gifts. He was not saying
23530: angrily within himself that he had made a profound mistake; but the
23531: mistake was at work in him like a recognized chronic disease, mingling
23532: its uneasy importunities with every prospect, and enfeebling every
23533: thought. As he went along the passage to the drawing-room, he heard the
23534: piano and singing. Of course, Ladislaw was there. It was some weeks
23535: since Will had parted from Dorothea, yet he was still at the old post
23536: in Middlemarch. Lydgate had no objection in general to Ladislaw’s
23537: coming, but just now he was annoyed that he could not find his hearth
23538: free. When he opened the door the two singers went on towards the
23539: key-note, raising their eyes and looking at him indeed, but not
23540: regarding his entrance as an interruption. To a man galled with his
23541: harness as poor Lydgate was, it is not soothing to see two people
23542: warbling at him, as he comes in with the sense that the painful day has
23543: still pains in store. His face, already paler than usual, took on a
23544: scowl as he walked across the room and flung himself into a chair.
23545: 
23546: The singers feeling themselves excused by the fact that they had only
23547: three bars to sing, now turned round.
23548: 
23549: “How are you, Lydgate?” said Will, coming forward to shake hands.
23550: 
23551: Lydgate took his hand, but did not think it necessary to speak.
23552: 
23553: “Have you dined, Tertius? I expected you much earlier,” said Rosamond,
23554: who had already seen that her husband was in a “horrible humor.” She
23555: seated herself in her usual place as she spoke.
23556: 
23557: “I have dined. I should like some tea, please,” said Lydgate, curtly,
23558: still scowling and looking markedly at his legs stretched out before
23559: him.
23560: 
23561: Will was too quick to need more. “I shall be off,” he said, reaching
23562: his hat.
23563: 
23564: “Tea is coming,” said Rosamond; “pray don’t go.”
23565: 
23566: “Yes, Lydgate is bored,” said Will, who had more comprehension of
23567: Lydgate than Rosamond had, and was not offended by his manner, easily
23568: imagining outdoor causes of annoyance.
23569: 
23570: “There is the more need for you to stay,” said Rosamond, playfully, and
23571: in her lightest accent; “he will not speak to me all the evening.”
23572: 
23573: “Yes, Rosamond, I shall,” said Lydgate, in his strong baritone. “I have
23574: some serious business to speak to you about.”
23575: 
23576: No introduction of the business could have been less like that which
23577: Lydgate had intended; but her indifferent manner had been too
23578: provoking.
23579: 
23580: “There! you see,” said Will. “I’m going to the meeting about the
23581: Mechanics’ Institute. Good-by;” and he went quickly out of the room.
23582: 
23583: Rosamond did not look at her husband, but presently rose and took her
23584: place before the tea-tray. She was thinking that she had never seen him
23585: so disagreeable. Lydgate turned his dark eyes on her and watched her as
23586: she delicately handled the tea-service with her taper fingers, and
23587: looked at the objects immediately before her with no curve in her face
23588: disturbed, and yet with an ineffable protest in her air against all
23589: people with unpleasant manners. For the moment he lost the sense of his
23590: wound in a sudden speculation about this new form of feminine
23591: impassibility revealing itself in the sylph-like frame which he had
23592: once interpreted as the sign of a ready intelligent sensitiveness. His
23593: mind glancing back to Laure while he looked at Rosamond, he said
23594: inwardly, “Would _she_ kill me because I wearied her?” and then, “It is
23595: the way with all women.” But this power of generalizing which gives men
23596: so much the superiority in mistake over the dumb animals, was
23597: immediately thwarted by Lydgate’s memory of wondering impressions from
23598: the behavior of another woman—from Dorothea’s looks and tones of
23599: emotion about her husband when Lydgate began to attend him—from her
23600: passionate cry to be taught what would best comfort that man for whose
23601: sake it seemed as if she must quell every impulse in her except the
23602: yearnings of faithfulness and compassion. These revived impressions
23603: succeeded each other quickly and dreamily in Lydgate’s mind while the
23604: tea was being brewed. He had shut his eyes in the last instant of
23605: reverie while he heard Dorothea saying, “Advise me—think what I can
23606: do—he has been all his life laboring and looking forward. He minds
23607: about nothing else—and I mind about nothing else.”
23608: 
23609: That voice of deep-souled womanhood had remained within him as the
23610: enkindling conceptions of dead and sceptred genius had remained within
23611: him (is there not a genius for feeling nobly which also reigns over
23612: human spirits and their conclusions?); the tones were a music from
23613: which he was falling away—he had really fallen into a momentary doze,
23614: when Rosamond said in her silvery neutral way, “Here is your tea,
23615: Tertius,” setting it on the small table by his side, and then moved
23616: back to her place without looking at him. Lydgate was too hasty in
23617: attributing insensibility to her; after her own fashion, she was
23618: sensitive enough, and took lasting impressions. Her impression now was
23619: one of offence and repulsion. But then, Rosamond had no scowls and had
23620: never raised her voice: she was quite sure that no one could justly
23621: find fault with her.
23622: 
23623: Perhaps Lydgate and she had never felt so far off each other before;
23624: but there were strong reasons for not deferring his revelation, even if
23625: he had not already begun it by that abrupt announcement; indeed some of
23626: the angry desire to rouse her into more sensibility on his account
23627: which had prompted him to speak prematurely, still mingled with his
23628: pain in the prospect of her pain. But he waited till the tray was gone,
23629: the candles were lit, and the evening quiet might be counted on: the
23630: interval had left time for repelled tenderness to return into the old
23631: course. He spoke kindly.
23632: 
23633: “Dear Rosy, lay down your work and come to sit by me,” he said, gently,
23634: pushing away the table, and stretching out his arm to draw a chair near
23635: his own.
23636: 
23637: Rosamond obeyed. As she came towards him in her drapery of transparent
23638: faintly tinted muslin, her slim yet round figure never looked more
23639: graceful; as she sat down by him and laid one hand on the elbow of his
23640: chair, at last looking at him and meeting his eyes, her delicate neck
23641: and cheek and purely cut lips never had more of that untarnished beauty
23642: which touches as in spring-time and infancy and all sweet freshness. It
23643: touched Lydgate now, and mingled the early moments of his love for her
23644: with all the other memories which were stirred in this crisis of deep
23645: trouble. He laid his ample hand softly on hers, saying—
23646: 
23647: “Dear!” with the lingering utterance which affection gives to the word.
23648: Rosamond too was still under the power of that same past, and her
23649: husband was still in part the Lydgate whose approval had stirred
23650: delight. She put his hair lightly away from his forehead, then laid her
23651: other hand on his, and was conscious of forgiving him.
23652: 
23653: “I am obliged to tell you what will hurt you, Rosy. But there are
23654: things which husband and wife must think of together. I dare say it has
23655: occurred to you already that I am short of money.”
23656: 
23657: Lydgate paused; but Rosamond turned her neck and looked at a vase on
23658: the mantel-piece.
23659: 
23660: “I was not able to pay for all the things we had to get before we were
23661: married, and there have been expenses since which I have been obliged
23662: to meet. The consequence is, there is a large debt at Brassing—three
23663: hundred and eighty pounds—which has been pressing on me a good while,
23664: and in fact we are getting deeper every day, for people don’t pay me
23665: the faster because others want the money. I took pains to keep it from
23666: you while you were not well; but now we must think together about it,
23667: and you must help me.”
23668: 
23669: “What can _I_ do, Tertius?” said Rosamond, turning her eyes on him
23670: again. That little speech of four words, like so many others in all
23671: languages, is capable by varied vocal inflections of expressing all
23672: states of mind from helpless dimness to exhaustive argumentative
23673: perception, from the completest self-devoting fellowship to the most
23674: neutral aloofness. Rosamond’s thin utterance threw into the words “What
23675: can—I—do!” as much neutrality as they could hold. They fell like a
23676: mortal chill on Lydgate’s roused tenderness. He did not storm in
23677: indignation—he felt too sad a sinking of the heart. And when he spoke
23678: again it was more in the tone of a man who forces himself to fulfil a
23679: task.
23680: 
23681: “It is necessary for you to know, because I have to give security for a
23682: time, and a man must come to make an inventory of the furniture.”
23683: 
23684: Rosamond colored deeply. “Have you not asked papa for money?” she said,
23685: as soon as she could speak.
23686: 
23687: “No.”
23688: 
23689: “Then I must ask him!” she said, releasing her hands from Lydgate’s,
23690: and rising to stand at two yards’ distance from him.
23691: 
23692: “No, Rosy,” said Lydgate, decisively. “It is too late to do that. The
23693: inventory will be begun to-morrow. Remember it is a mere security: it
23694: will make no difference: it is a temporary affair. I insist upon it
23695: that your father shall not know, unless I choose to tell him,” added
23696: Lydgate, with a more peremptory emphasis.
23697: 
23698: This certainly was unkind, but Rosamond had thrown him back on evil
23699: expectation as to what she would do in the way of quiet steady
23700: disobedience. The unkindness seemed unpardonable to her: she was not
23701: given to weeping and disliked it, but now her chin and lips began to
23702: tremble and the tears welled up. Perhaps it was not possible for
23703: Lydgate, under the double stress of outward material difficulty and of
23704: his own proud resistance to humiliating consequences, to imagine fully
23705: what this sudden trial was to a young creature who had known nothing
23706: but indulgence, and whose dreams had all been of new indulgence, more
23707: exactly to her taste. But he did wish to spare her as much as he could,
23708: and her tears cut him to the heart. He could not speak again
23709: immediately; but Rosamond did not go on sobbing: she tried to conquer
23710: her agitation and wiped away her tears, continuing to look before her
23711: at the mantel-piece.
23712: 
23713: “Try not to grieve, darling,” said Lydgate, turning his eyes up towards
23714: her. That she had chosen to move away from him in this moment of her
23715: trouble made everything harder to say, but he must absolutely go on.
23716: “We must brace ourselves to do what is necessary. It is I who have been
23717: in fault: I ought to have seen that I could not afford to live in this
23718: way. But many things have told against me in my practice, and it really
23719: just now has ebbed to a low point. I may recover it, but in the mean
23720: time we must pull up—we must change our way of living. We shall weather
23721: it. When I have given this security I shall have time to look about me;
23722: and you are so clever that if you turn your mind to managing you will
23723: school me into carefulness. I have been a thoughtless rascal about
23724: squaring prices—but come, dear, sit down and forgive me.”
23725: 
23726: Lydgate was bowing his neck under the yoke like a creature who had
23727: talons, but who had Reason too, which often reduces us to meekness.
23728: When he had spoken the last words in an imploring tone, Rosamond
23729: returned to the chair by his side. His self-blame gave her some hope
23730: that he would attend to her opinion, and she said—
23731: 
23732: “Why can you not put off having the inventory made? You can send the
23733: men away to-morrow when they come.”
23734: 
23735: “I shall not send them away,” said Lydgate, the peremptoriness rising
23736: again. Was it of any use to explain?
23737: 
23738: “If we left Middlemarch? there would of course be a sale, and that
23739: would do as well.”
23740: 
23741: “But we are not going to leave Middlemarch.”
23742: 
23743: “I am sure, Tertius, it would be much better to do so. Why can we not
23744: go to London? Or near Durham, where your family is known?”
23745: 
23746: “We can go nowhere without money, Rosamond.”
23747: 
23748: “Your friends would not wish you to be without money. And surely these
23749: odious tradesmen might be made to understand that, and to wait, if you
23750: would make proper representations to them.”
23751: 
23752: “This is idle Rosamond,” said Lydgate, angrily. “You must learn to take
23753: my judgment on questions you don’t understand. I have made necessary
23754: arrangements, and they must be carried out. As to friends, I have no
23755: expectations whatever from them, and shall not ask them for anything.”
23756: 
23757: Rosamond sat perfectly still. The thought in her mind was that if she
23758: had known how Lydgate would behave, she would never have married him.
23759: 
23760: “We have no time to waste now on unnecessary words, dear,” said
23761: Lydgate, trying to be gentle again. “There are some details that I want
23762: to consider with you. Dover says he will take a good deal of the plate
23763: back again, and any of the jewellery we like. He really behaves very
23764: well.”
23765: 
23766: “Are we to go without spoons and forks then?” said Rosamond, whose very
23767: lips seemed to get thinner with the thinness of her utterance. She was
23768: determined to make no further resistance or suggestions.
23769: 
23770: “Oh no, dear!” said Lydgate. “But look here,” he continued, drawing a
23771: paper from his pocket and opening it; “here is Dover’s account. See, I
23772: have marked a number of articles, which if we returned them would
23773: reduce the amount by thirty pounds and more. I have not marked any of
23774: the jewellery.” Lydgate had really felt this point of the jewellery
23775: very bitter to himself; but he had overcome the feeling by severe
23776: argument. He could not propose to Rosamond that she should return any
23777: particular present of his, but he had told himself that he was bound to
23778: put Dover’s offer before her, and her inward prompting might make the
23779: affair easy.
23780: 
23781: “It is useless for me to look, Tertius,” said Rosamond, calmly; “you
23782: will return what you please.” She would not turn her eyes on the paper,
23783: and Lydgate, flushing up to the roots of his hair, drew it back and let
23784: it fall on his knee. Meanwhile Rosamond quietly went out of the room,
23785: leaving Lydgate helpless and wondering. Was she not coming back? It
23786: seemed that she had no more identified herself with him than if they
23787: had been creatures of different species and opposing interests. He
23788: tossed his head and thrust his hands deep into his pockets with a sort
23789: of vengeance. There was still science—there were still good objects to
23790: work for. He must give a tug still—all the stronger because other
23791: satisfactions were going.
23792: 
23793: But the door opened and Rosamond re-entered. She carried the leather
23794: box containing the amethysts, and a tiny ornamental basket which
23795: contained other boxes, and laying them on the chair where she had been
23796: sitting, she said, with perfect propriety in her air—
23797: 
23798: “This is all the jewellery you ever gave me. You can return what you
23799: like of it, and of the plate also. You will not, of course, expect me
23800: to stay at home to-morrow. I shall go to papa’s.”
23801: 
23802: To many women the look Lydgate cast at her would have been more
23803: terrible than one of anger: it had in it a despairing acceptance of the
23804: distance she was placing between them.
23805: 
23806: “And when shall you come back again?” he said, with a bitter edge on
23807: his accent.
23808: 
23809: “Oh, in the evening. Of course I shall not mention the subject to
23810: mamma.” Rosamond was convinced that no woman could behave more
23811: irreproachably than she was behaving; and she went to sit down at her
23812: work-table. Lydgate sat meditating a minute or two, and the result was
23813: that he said, with some of the old emotion in his tone—
23814: 
23815: “Now we have been united, Rosy, you should not leave me to myself in
23816: the first trouble that has come.”
23817: 
23818: “Certainly not,” said Rosamond; “I shall do everything it becomes me to
23819: do.”
23820: 
23821: “It is not right that the thing should be left to servants, or that I
23822: should have to speak to them about it. And I shall be obliged to go
23823: out—I don’t know how early. I understand your shrinking from the
23824: humiliation of these money affairs. But, my dear Rosamond, as a
23825: question of pride, which I feel just as much as you can, it is surely
23826: better to manage the thing ourselves, and let the servants see as
23827: little of it as possible; and since you are my wife, there is no
23828: hindering your share in my disgraces—if there were disgraces.”
23829: 
23830: Rosamond did not answer immediately, but at last she said, “Very well,
23831: I will stay at home.”
23832: 
23833: “I shall not touch these jewels, Rosy. Take them away again. But I will
23834: write out a list of plate that we may return, and that can be packed up
23835: and sent at once.”
23836: 
23837: “The servants will know _that_,” said Rosamond, with the slightest
23838: touch of sarcasm.
23839: 
23840: “Well, we must meet some disagreeables as necessities. Where is the
23841: ink, I wonder?” said Lydgate, rising, and throwing the account on the
23842: larger table where he meant to write.
23843: 
23844: Rosamond went to reach the inkstand, and after setting it on the table
23845: was going to turn away, when Lydgate, who was standing close by, put
23846: his arm round her and drew her towards him, saying—
23847: 
23848: “Come, darling, let us make the best of things. It will only be for a
23849: time, I hope, that we shall have to be stingy and particular. Kiss me.”
23850: 
23851: His native warm-heartedness took a great deal of quenching, and it is a
23852: part of manliness for a husband to feel keenly the fact that an
23853: inexperienced girl has got into trouble by marrying him. She received
23854: his kiss and returned it faintly, and in this way an appearance of
23855: accord was recovered for the time. But Lydgate could not help looking
23856: forward with dread to the inevitable future discussions about
23857: expenditure and the necessity for a complete change in their way of
23858: living.
23859:

23861: 
23862: 
23863: CHAPTER LIX.
23864: 
23865: “They said of old the Soul had human shape,
23866: But smaller, subtler than the fleshly self,
23867: So wandered forth for airing when it pleased.
23868: And see! beside her cherub-face there floats
23869: A pale-lipped form aerial whispering
23870: Its promptings in that little shell her ear.”
23871: 
23872: 
23873: News is often dispersed as thoughtlessly and effectively as that pollen
23874: which the bees carry off (having no idea how powdery they are) when
23875: they are buzzing in search of their particular nectar. This fine
23876: comparison has reference to Fred Vincy, who on that evening at Lowick
23877: Parsonage heard a lively discussion among the ladies on the news which
23878: their old servant had got from Tantripp concerning Mr. Casaubon’s
23879: strange mention of Mr. Ladislaw in a codicil to his will made not long
23880: before his death. Miss Winifred was astounded to find that her brother
23881: had known the fact before, and observed that Camden was the most
23882: wonderful man for knowing things and not telling them; whereupon Mary
23883: Garth said that the codicil had perhaps got mixed up with the habits of
23884: spiders, which Miss Winifred never would listen to. Mrs. Farebrother
23885: considered that the news had something to do with their having only
23886: once seen Mr. Ladislaw at Lowick, and Miss Noble made many small
23887: compassionate mewings.
23888: 
23889: Fred knew little and cared less about Ladislaw and the Casaubons, and
23890: his mind never recurred to that discussion till one day calling on
23891: Rosamond at his mother’s request to deliver a message as he passed, he
23892: happened to see Ladislaw going away. Fred and Rosamond had little to
23893: say to each other now that marriage had removed her from collision with
23894: the unpleasantness of brothers, and especially now that he had taken
23895: what she held the stupid and even reprehensible step of giving up the
23896: Church to take to such a business as Mr. Garth’s. Hence Fred talked by
23897: preference of what he considered indifferent news, and “a propos of
23898: that young Ladislaw” mentioned what he had heard at Lowick Parsonage.
23899: 
23900: Now Lydgate, like Mr. Farebrother, knew a great deal more than he told,
23901: and when he had once been set thinking about the relation between Will
23902: and Dorothea his conjectures had gone beyond the fact. He imagined that
23903: there was a passionate attachment on both sides, and this struck him as
23904: much too serious to gossip about. He remembered Will’s irritability
23905: when he had mentioned Mrs. Casaubon, and was the more circumspect. On
23906: the whole his surmises, in addition to what he knew of the fact,
23907: increased his friendliness and tolerance towards Ladislaw, and made him
23908: understand the vacillation which kept him at Middlemarch after he had
23909: said that he should go away. It was significant of the separateness
23910: between Lydgate’s mind and Rosamond’s that he had no impulse to speak
23911: to her on the subject; indeed, he did not quite trust her reticence
23912: towards Will. And he was right there; though he had no vision of the
23913: way in which her mind would act in urging her to speak.
23914: 
23915: When she repeated Fred’s news to Lydgate, he said, “Take care you don’t
23916: drop the faintest hint to Ladislaw, Rosy. He is likely to fly out as if
23917: you insulted him. Of course it is a painful affair.”
23918: 
23919: Rosamond turned her neck and patted her hair, looking the image of
23920: placid indifference. But the next time Will came when Lydgate was away,
23921: she spoke archly about his not going to London as he had threatened.
23922: 
23923: “I know all about it. I have a confidential little bird,” said she,
23924: showing very pretty airs of her head over the bit of work held high
23925: between her active fingers. “There is a powerful magnet in this
23926: neighborhood.”
23927: 
23928: “To be sure there is. Nobody knows that better than you,” said Will,
23929: with light gallantry, but inwardly prepared to be angry.
23930: 
23931: “It is really the most charming romance: Mr. Casaubon jealous, and
23932: foreseeing that there was no one else whom Mrs. Casaubon would so much
23933: like to marry, and no one who would so much like to marry her as a
23934: certain gentleman; and then laying a plan to spoil all by making her
23935: forfeit her property if she did marry that gentleman—and then—and
23936: then—and then—oh, I have no doubt the end will be thoroughly romantic.”
23937: 
23938: “Great God! what do you mean?” said Will, flushing over face and ears,
23939: his features seeming to change as if he had had a violent shake. “Don’t
23940: joke; tell me what you mean.”
23941: 
23942: “You don’t really know?” said Rosamond, no longer playful, and desiring
23943: nothing better than to tell in order that she might evoke effects.
23944: 
23945: “No!” he returned, impatiently.
23946: 
23947: “Don’t know that Mr. Casaubon has left it in his will that if Mrs.
23948: Casaubon marries you she is to forfeit all her property?”
23949: 
23950: “How do you know that it is true?” said Will, eagerly.
23951: 
23952: “My brother Fred heard it from the Farebrothers.” Will started up from
23953: his chair and reached his hat.
23954: 
23955: “I dare say she likes you better than the property,” said Rosamond,
23956: looking at him from a distance.
23957: 
23958: “Pray don’t say any more about it,” said Will, in a hoarse undertone
23959: extremely unlike his usual light voice. “It is a foul insult to her and
23960: to me.” Then he sat down absently, looking before him, but seeing
23961: nothing.
23962: 
23963: “Now you are angry with _me_,” said Rosamond. “It is too bad to bear
23964: _me_ malice. You ought to be obliged to me for telling you.”
23965: 
23966: “So I am,” said Will, abruptly, speaking with that kind of double soul
23967: which belongs to dreamers who answer questions.
23968: 
23969: “I expect to hear of the marriage,” said Rosamond, playfully.
23970: 
23971: “Never! You will never hear of the marriage!”
23972: 
23973: With those words uttered impetuously, Will rose, put out his hand to
23974: Rosamond, still with the air of a somnambulist, and went away.
23975: 
23976: When he was gone, Rosamond left her chair and walked to the other end
23977: of the room, leaning when she got there against a chiffonniere, and
23978: looking out of the window wearily. She was oppressed by ennui, and by
23979: that dissatisfaction which in women’s minds is continually turning into
23980: a trivial jealousy, referring to no real claims, springing from no
23981: deeper passion than the vague exactingness of egoism, and yet capable
23982: of impelling action as well as speech. “There really is nothing to care
23983: for much,” said poor Rosamond inwardly, thinking of the family at
23984: Quallingham, who did not write to her; and that perhaps Tertius when he
23985: came home would tease her about expenses. She had already secretly
23986: disobeyed him by asking her father to help them, and he had ended
23987: decisively by saying, “I am more likely to want help myself.”
23988: 
23989: 
23990: 
23991: 
23992: CHAPTER LX.
23993: 
23994: Good phrases are surely, and ever were, very commendable.
23995: —_Justice Shallow_.
23996: 
23997: 
23998: A few days afterwards—it was already the end of August—there was an
23999: occasion which caused some excitement in Middlemarch: the public, if it
24000: chose, was to have the advantage of buying, under the distinguished
24001: auspices of Mr. Borthrop Trumbull, the furniture, books, and pictures
24002: which anybody might see by the handbills to be the best in every kind,
24003: belonging to Edwin Larcher, Esq. This was not one of the sales
24004: indicating the depression of trade; on the contrary, it was due to Mr.
24005: Larcher’s great success in the carrying business, which warranted his
24006: purchase of a mansion near Riverston already furnished in high style by
24007: an illustrious Spa physician—furnished indeed with such large framefuls
24008: of expensive flesh-painting in the dining-room, that Mrs. Larcher was
24009: nervous until reassured by finding the subjects to be Scriptural. Hence
24010: the fine opportunity to purchasers which was well pointed out in the
24011: handbills of Mr. Borthrop Trumbull, whose acquaintance with the history
24012: of art enabled him to state that the hall furniture, to be sold without
24013: reserve, comprised a piece of carving by a contemporary of Gibbons.
24014: 
24015: At Middlemarch in those times a large sale was regarded as a kind of
24016: festival. There was a table spread with the best cold eatables, as at a
24017: superior funeral; and facilities were offered for that
24018: generous-drinking of cheerful glasses which might lead to generous and
24019: cheerful bidding for undesirable articles. Mr. Larcher’s sale was the
24020: more attractive in the fine weather because the house stood just at the
24021: end of the town, with a garden and stables attached, in that pleasant
24022: issue from Middlemarch called the London Road, which was also the road
24023: to the New Hospital and to Mr. Bulstrode’s retired residence, known as
24024: the Shrubs. In short, the auction was as good as a fair, and drew all
24025: classes with leisure at command: to some, who risked making bids in
24026: order simply to raise prices, it was almost equal to betting at the
24027: races. The second day, when the best furniture was to be sold,
24028: “everybody” was there; even Mr. Thesiger, the rector of St. Peter’s,
24029: had looked in for a short time, wishing to buy the carved table, and
24030: had rubbed elbows with Mr. Bambridge and Mr. Horrock. There was a
24031: wreath of Middlemarch ladies accommodated with seats round the large
24032: table in the dining-room, where Mr. Borthrop Trumbull was mounted with
24033: desk and hammer; but the rows chiefly of masculine faces behind were
24034: often varied by incomings and outgoings both from the door and the
24035: large bow-window opening on to the lawn.
24036: 
24037: “Everybody” that day did not include Mr. Bulstrode, whose health could
24038: not well endure crowds and draughts. But Mrs. Bulstrode had
24039: particularly wished to have a certain picture—a “Supper at Emmaus,”
24040: attributed in the catalogue to Guido; and at the last moment before the
24041: day of the sale Mr. Bulstrode had called at the office of the
24042: “Pioneer,” of which he was now one of the proprietors, to beg of Mr.
24043: Ladislaw as a great favor that he would obligingly use his remarkable
24044: knowledge of pictures on behalf of Mrs. Bulstrode, and judge of the
24045: value of this particular painting—“if,” added the scrupulously polite
24046: banker, “attendance at the sale would not interfere with the
24047: arrangements for your departure, which I know is imminent.”
24048: 
24049: This proviso might have sounded rather satirically in Will’s ear if he
24050: had been in a mood to care about such satire. It referred to an
24051: understanding entered into many weeks before with the proprietors of
24052: the paper, that he should be at liberty any day he pleased to hand over
24053: the management to the subeditor whom he had been training; since he
24054: wished finally to quit Middlemarch. But indefinite visions of ambition
24055: are weak against the ease of doing what is habitual or beguilingly
24056: agreeable; and we all know the difficulty of carrying out a resolve
24057: when we secretly long that it may turn out to be unnecessary. In such
24058: states of mind the most incredulous person has a private leaning
24059: towards miracle: impossible to conceive how our wish could be
24060: fulfilled, still—very wonderful things have happened! Will did not
24061: confess this weakness to himself, but he lingered. What was the use of
24062: going to London at that time of the year? The Rugby men who would
24063: remember him were not there; and so far as political writing was
24064: concerned, he would rather for a few weeks go on with the “Pioneer.” At
24065: the present moment, however, when Mr. Bulstrode was speaking to him, he
24066: had both a strengthened resolve to go and an equally strong resolve not
24067: to go till he had once more seen Dorothea. Hence he replied that he had
24068: reasons for deferring his departure a little, and would be happy to go
24069: to the sale.
24070: 
24071: Will was in a defiant mood, his consciousness being deeply stung with
24072: the thought that the people who looked at him probably knew a fact
24073: tantamount to an accusation against him as a fellow with low designs
24074: which were to be frustrated by a disposal of property. Like most people
24075: who assert their freedom with regard to conventional distinction, he
24076: was prepared to be sudden and quick at quarrel with any one who might
24077: hint that he had personal reasons for that assertion—that there was
24078: anything in his blood, his bearing, or his character to which he gave
24079: the mask of an opinion. When he was under an irritating impression of
24080: this kind he would go about for days with a defiant look, the color
24081: changing in his transparent skin as if he were on the _qui vive_,
24082: watching for something which he had to dart upon.
24083: 
24084: This expression was peculiarly noticeable in him at the sale, and those
24085: who had only seen him in his moods of gentle oddity or of bright
24086: enjoyment would have been struck with a contrast. He was not sorry to
24087: have this occasion for appearing in public before the Middlemarch
24088: tribes of Toller, Hackbutt, and the rest, who looked down on him as an
24089: adventurer, and were in a state of brutal ignorance about Dante—who
24090: sneered at his Polish blood, and were themselves of a breed very much
24091: in need of crossing. He stood in a conspicuous place not far from the
24092: auctioneer, with a fore-finger in each side-pocket and his head thrown
24093: backward, not caring to speak to anybody, though he had been cordially
24094: welcomed as a connoiss_ure_ by Mr. Trumbull, who was enjoying the
24095: utmost activity of his great faculties.
24096: 
24097: And surely among all men whose vocation requires them to exhibit their
24098: powers of speech, the happiest is a prosperous provincial auctioneer
24099: keenly alive to his own jokes and sensible of his encyclopedic
24100: knowledge. Some saturnine, sour-blooded persons might object to be
24101: constantly insisting on the merits of all articles from boot-jacks to
24102: “Berghems;” but Mr. Borthrop Trumbull had a kindly liquid in his veins;
24103: he was an admirer by nature, and would have liked to have the universe
24104: under his hammer, feeling that it would go at a higher figure for his
24105: recommendation.
24106: 
24107: Meanwhile Mrs. Larcher’s drawing-room furniture was enough for him.
24108: When Will Ladislaw had come in, a second fender, said to have been
24109: forgotten in its right place, suddenly claimed the auctioneer’s
24110: enthusiasm, which he distributed on the equitable principle of praising
24111: those things most which were most in need of praise. The fender was of
24112: polished steel, with much lancet-shaped open-work and a sharp edge.
24113: 
24114: “Now, ladies,” said he, “I shall appeal to you. Here is a fender which
24115: at any other sale would hardly be offered with out reserve, being, as I
24116: may say, for quality of steel and quaintness of design, a kind of
24117: thing”—here Mr. Trumbull dropped his voice and became slightly nasal,
24118: trimming his outlines with his left finger—“that might not fall in with
24119: ordinary tastes. Allow me to tell you that by-and-by this style of
24120: workmanship will be the only one in vogue—half-a-crown, you said? thank
24121: you—going at half-a-crown, this characteristic fender; and I have
24122: particular information that the antique style is very much sought after
24123: in high quarters. Three shillings—three-and-sixpence—hold it well up,
24124: Joseph! Look, ladies, at the chastity of the design—I have no doubt
24125: myself that it was turned out in the last century! Four shillings, Mr.
24126: Mawmsey?—four shillings.”
24127: 
24128: “It’s not a thing I would put in _my_ drawing-room,” said Mrs. Mawmsey,
24129: audibly, for the warning of the rash husband. “I wonder _at_ Mrs.
24130: Larcher. Every blessed child’s head that fell against it would be cut
24131: in two. The edge is like a knife.”
24132: 
24133: “Quite true,” rejoined Mr. Trumbull, quickly, “and most uncommonly
24134: useful to have a fender at hand that will cut, if you have a leather
24135: shoe-tie or a bit of string that wants cutting and no knife at hand:
24136: many a man has been left hanging because there was no knife to cut him
24137: down. Gentlemen, here’s a fender that if you had the misfortune to hang
24138: yourselves would cut you down in no time—with astonishing
24139: celerity—four-and-sixpence—five—five-and-sixpence—an appropriate thing
24140: for a spare bedroom where there was a four-poster and a guest a little
24141: out of his mind—six shillings—thank you, Mr. Clintup—going at six
24142: shillings—going—gone!” The auctioneer’s glance, which had been
24143: searching round him with a preternatural susceptibility to all signs of
24144: bidding, here dropped on the paper before him, and his voice too
24145: dropped into a tone of indifferent despatch as he said, “Mr. Clintup.
24146: Be handy, Joseph.”
24147: 
24148: “It was worth six shillings to have a fender you could always tell that
24149: joke on,” said Mr. Clintup, laughing low and apologetically to his next
24150: neighbor. He was a diffident though distinguished nurseryman, and
24151: feared that the audience might regard his bid as a foolish one.
24152: 
24153: Meanwhile Joseph had brought a trayful of small articles. “Now,
24154: ladies,” said Mr. Trumbull, taking up one of the articles, “this tray
24155: contains a very recherchy lot—a collection of trifles for the
24156: drawing-room table—and trifles make the sum _of_ human things—nothing
24157: more important than trifles—(yes, Mr. Ladislaw, yes, by-and-by)—but
24158: pass the tray round, Joseph—these bijoux must be examined, ladies. This
24159: I have in my hand is an ingenious contrivance—a sort of practical
24160: rebus, I may call it: here, you see, it looks like an elegant
24161: heart-shaped box, portable—for the pocket; there, again, it becomes
24162: like a splendid double flower—an ornament for the table; and now”—Mr.
24163: Trumbull allowed the flower to fall alarmingly into strings of
24164: heart-shaped leaves—“a book of riddles! No less than five hundred
24165: printed in a beautiful red. Gentlemen, if I had less of a conscience, I
24166: should not wish you to bid high for this lot—I have a longing for it
24167: myself. What can promote innocent mirth, and I may say virtue, more
24168: than a good riddle?—it hinders profane language, and attaches a man to
24169: the society of refined females. This ingenious article itself, without
24170: the elegant domino-box, card-basket, &c., ought alone to give a high
24171: price to the lot. Carried in the pocket it might make an individual
24172: welcome in any society. Four shillings, sir?—four shillings for this
24173: remarkable collection of riddles with the et caeteras. Here is a
24174: sample: ‘How must you spell honey to make it catch lady-birds?
24175: Answer—money.’ You hear?—lady-birds—honey money. This is an amusement
24176: to sharpen the intellect; it has a sting—it has what we call satire,
24177: and wit without indecency. Four-and-sixpence—five shillings.”
24178: 
24179: The bidding ran on with warming rivalry. Mr. Bowyer was a bidder, and
24180: this was too exasperating. Bowyer couldn’t afford it, and only wanted
24181: to hinder every other man from making a figure. The current carried
24182: even Mr. Horrock with it, but this committal of himself to an opinion
24183: fell from him with so little sacrifice of his neutral expression, that
24184: the bid might not have been detected as his but for the friendly oaths
24185: of Mr. Bambridge, who wanted to know what Horrock would do with blasted
24186: stuff only fit for haberdashers given over to that state of perdition
24187: which the horse-dealer so cordially recognized in the majority of
24188: earthly existences. The lot was finally knocked down at a guinea to Mr.
24189: Spilkins, a young Slender of the neighborhood, who was reckless with
24190: his pocket-money and felt his want of memory for riddles.
24191: 
24192: “Come, Trumbull, this is too bad—you’ve been putting some old maid’s
24193: rubbish into the sale,” murmured Mr. Toller, getting close to the
24194: auctioneer. “I want to see how the prints go, and I must be off soon.”
24195: 
24196: “_Im_mediately, Mr. Toller. It was only an act of benevolence which
24197: your noble heart would approve. Joseph! quick with the prints—Lot 235.
24198: Now, gentlemen, you who are connoiss_ures_, you are going to have a
24199: treat. Here is an engraving of the Duke of Wellington surrounded by his
24200: staff on the Field of Waterloo; and notwithstanding recent events which
24201: have, as it were, enveloped our great Hero in a cloud, I will be bold
24202: to say—for a man in my line must not be blown about by political
24203: winds—that a finer subject—of the modern order, belonging to our own
24204: time and epoch—the understanding of man could hardly conceive: angels
24205: might, perhaps, but not men, sirs, not men.”
24206: 
24207: “Who painted it?” said Mr. Powderell, much impressed.
24208: 
24209: “It is a proof before the letter, Mr. Powderell—the painter is not
24210: known,” answered Trumbull, with a certain gaspingness in his last
24211: words, after which he pursed up his lips and stared round him.
24212: 
24213: “I’ll bid a pound!” said Mr. Powderell, in a tone of resolved emotion,
24214: as of a man ready to put himself in the breach. Whether from awe or
24215: pity, nobody raised the price on him.
24216: 
24217: Next came two Dutch prints which Mr. Toller had been eager for, and
24218: after he had secured them he went away. Other prints, and afterwards
24219: some paintings, were sold to leading Middlemarchers who had come with a
24220: special desire for them, and there was a more active movement of the
24221: audience in and out; some, who had bought what they wanted, going away,
24222: others coming in either quite newly or from a temporary visit to the
24223: refreshments which were spread under the marquee on the lawn. It was
24224: this marquee that Mr. Bambridge was bent on buying, and he appeared to
24225: like looking inside it frequently, as a foretaste of its possession. On
24226: the last occasion of his return from it he was observed to bring with
24227: him a new companion, a stranger to Mr. Trumbull and every one else,
24228: whose appearance, however, led to the supposition that he might be a
24229: relative of the horse-dealer’s—also “given to indulgence.” His large
24230: whiskers, imposing swagger, and swing of the leg, made him a striking
24231: figure; but his suit of black, rather shabby at the edges, caused the
24232: prejudicial inference that he was not able to afford himself as much
24233: indulgence as he liked.
24234: 
24235: “Who is it you’ve picked up, Bam?” said Mr. Horrock, aside.
24236: 
24237: “Ask him yourself,” returned Mr. Bambridge. “He said he’d just turned
24238: in from the road.”
24239: 
24240: Mr. Horrock eyed the stranger, who was leaning back against his stick
24241: with one hand, using his toothpick with the other, and looking about
24242: him with a certain restlessness apparently under the silence imposed on
24243: him by circumstances.
24244: 
24245: At length the “Supper at Emmaus” was brought forward, to Will’s immense
24246: relief, for he was getting so tired of the proceedings that he had
24247: drawn back a little and leaned his shoulder against the wall just
24248: behind the auctioneer. He now came forward again, and his eye caught
24249: the conspicuous stranger, who, rather to his surprise, was staring at
24250: him markedly. But Will was immediately appealed to by Mr. Trumbull.
24251: 
24252: “Yes, Mr. Ladislaw, yes; this interests you as a connoiss_ure_, I
24253: think. It is some pleasure,” the auctioneer went on with a rising
24254: fervor, “to have a picture like this to show to a company of ladies and
24255: gentlemen—a picture worth any sum to an individual whose means were on
24256: a level with his judgment. It is a painting of the Italian school—by
24257: the celebrated _Guydo_, the greatest painter in the world, the chief of
24258: the Old Masters, as they are called—I take it, because they were up to
24259: a thing or two beyond most of us—in possession of secrets now lost to
24260: the bulk of mankind. Let me tell you, gentlemen, I have seen a great
24261: many pictures by the Old Masters, and they are not all up to this
24262: mark—some of them are darker than you might like and not family
24263: subjects. But here is a _Guydo_—the frame alone is worth pounds—which
24264: any lady might be proud to hang up—a suitable thing for what we call a
24265: refectory in a charitable institution, if any gentleman of the
24266: Corporation wished to show his munifi_cence_. Turn it a little, sir?
24267: yes. Joseph, turn it a little towards Mr. Ladislaw—Mr. Ladislaw, having
24268: been abroad, understands the merit of these things, you observe.”
24269: 
24270: All eyes were for a moment turned towards Will, who said, coolly, “Five
24271: pounds.” The auctioneer burst out in deep remonstrance.
24272: 
24273: “Ah! Mr. Ladislaw! the frame alone is worth that. Ladies and gentlemen,
24274: for the credit of the town! Suppose it should be discovered hereafter
24275: that a gem of art has been amongst us in this town, and nobody in
24276: Middlemarch awake to it. Five guineas—five seven-six—five ten. Still,
24277: ladies, still! It is a gem, and ‘Full many a gem,’ as the poet says,
24278: has been allowed to go at a nominal price because the public knew no
24279: better, because it was offered in circles where there was—I was going
24280: to say a low feeling, but no!—Six pounds—six guineas—a _Guydo_ of the
24281: first order going at six guineas—it is an insult to religion, ladies;
24282: it touches us all as Christians, gentlemen, that a subject like this
24283: should go at such a low figure—six pounds ten—seven—”
24284: 
24285: The bidding was brisk, and Will continued to share in it, remembering
24286: that Mrs. Bulstrode had a strong wish for the picture, and thinking
24287: that he might stretch the price to twelve pounds. But it was knocked
24288: down to him at ten guineas, whereupon he pushed his way towards the
24289: bow-window and went out. He chose to go under the marquee to get a
24290: glass of water, being hot and thirsty: it was empty of other visitors,
24291: and he asked the woman in attendance to fetch him some fresh water; but
24292: before she was well gone he was annoyed to see entering the florid
24293: stranger who had stared at him. It struck Will at this moment that the
24294: man might be one of those political parasitic insects of the bloated
24295: kind who had once or twice claimed acquaintance with him as having
24296: heard him speak on the Reform question, and who might think of getting
24297: a shilling by news. In this light his person, already rather heating to
24298: behold on a summer’s day, appeared the more disagreeable; and Will,
24299: half-seated on the elbow of a garden-chair, turned his eyes carefully
24300: away from the comer. But this signified little to our acquaintance Mr.
24301: Raffles, who never hesitated to thrust himself on unwilling
24302: observation, if it suited his purpose to do so. He moved a step or two
24303: till he was in front of Will, and said with full-mouthed haste, “Excuse
24304: me, Mr. Ladislaw—was your mother’s name Sarah Dunkirk?”
24305: 
24306: Will, starting to his feet, moved backward a step, frowning, and saying
24307: with some fierceness, “Yes, sir, it was. And what is that to you?”
24308: 
24309: It was in Will’s nature that the first spark it threw out was a direct
24310: answer of the question and a challenge of the consequences. To have
24311: said, “What is that to you?” in the first instance, would have seemed
24312: like shuffling—as if he minded who knew anything about his origin!
24313: 
24314: Raffles on his side had not the same eagerness for a collision which
24315: was implied in Ladislaw’s threatening air. The slim young fellow with
24316: his girl’s complexion looked like a tiger-cat ready to spring on him.
24317: Under such circumstances Mr. Raffles’s pleasure in annoying his company
24318: was kept in abeyance.
24319: 
24320: “No offence, my good sir, no offence! I only remember your mother—knew
24321: her when she was a girl. But it is your father that you feature, sir. I
24322: had the pleasure of seeing your father too. Parents alive, Mr.
24323: Ladislaw?”
24324: 
24325: “No!” thundered Will, in the same attitude as before.
24326: 
24327: “Should be glad to do you a service, Mr. Ladislaw—by Jove, I should!
24328: Hope to meet again.”
24329: 
24330: Hereupon Raffles, who had lifted his hat with the last words, turned
24331: himself round with a swing of his leg and walked away. Will looked
24332: after him a moment, and could see that he did not re-enter the
24333: auction-room, but appeared to be walking towards the road. For an
24334: instant he thought that he had been foolish not to let the man go on
24335: talking;—but no! on the whole he preferred doing without knowledge from
24336: that source.
24337: 
24338: Later in the evening, however, Raffles overtook him in the street, and
24339: appearing either to have forgotten the roughness of his former
24340: reception or to intend avenging it by a forgiving familiarity, greeted
24341: him jovially and walked by his side, remarking at first on the
24342: pleasantness of the town and neighborhood. Will suspected that the man
24343: had been drinking and was considering how to shake him off when Raffles
24344: said—
24345: 
24346: “I’ve been abroad myself, Mr. Ladislaw—I’ve seen the world—used to
24347: parley-vous a little. It was at Boulogne I saw your father—a most
24348: uncommon likeness you are of him, by Jove! mouth—nose—eyes—hair turned
24349: off your brow just like his—a little in the foreign style. John Bull
24350: doesn’t do much of that. But your father was very ill when I saw him.
24351: Lord, lord! hands you might see through. You were a small youngster
24352: then. Did he get well?”
24353: 
24354: “No,” said Will, curtly.
24355: 
24356: “Ah! Well! I’ve often wondered what became of your mother. She ran away
24357: from her friends when she was a young lass—a proud-spirited lass, and
24358: pretty, by Jove! I knew the reason why she ran away,” said Raffles,
24359: winking slowly as he looked sideways at Will.
24360: 
24361: “You know nothing dishonorable of her, sir,” said Will, turning on him
24362: rather savagely. But Mr. Raffles just now was not sensitive to shades
24363: of manner.
24364: 
24365: “Not a bit!” said he, tossing his head decisively. “She was a little
24366: too honorable to like her friends—that was it!” Here Raffles again
24367: winked slowly. “Lord bless you, I knew all about ’em—a little in what
24368: you may call the respectable thieving line—the high style of
24369: receiving-house—none of your holes and corners—first-rate. Slap-up
24370: shop, high profits and no mistake. But Lord! Sarah would have known
24371: nothing about it—a dashing young lady she was—fine boarding-school—fit
24372: for a lord’s wife—only Archie Duncan threw it at her out of spite,
24373: because she would have nothing to do with him. And so she ran away from
24374: the whole concern. I travelled for ’em, sir, in a gentlemanly way—at a
24375: high salary. They didn’t mind her running away at first—godly folks,
24376: sir, very godly—and she was for the stage. The son was alive then, and
24377: the daughter was at a discount. Hallo! here we are at the Blue Bull.
24378: What do you say, Mr. Ladislaw?—shall we turn in and have a glass?”
24379: 
24380: “No, I must say good evening,” said Will, dashing up a passage which
24381: led into Lowick Gate, and almost running to get out of Raffles’s reach.
24382: 
24383: He walked a long while on the Lowick road away from the town, glad of
24384: the starlit darkness when it came. He felt as if he had had dirt cast
24385: on him amidst shouts of scorn. There was this to confirm the fellow’s
24386: statement—that his mother never would tell him the reason why she had
24387: run away from her family.
24388: 
24389: Well! what was he, Will Ladislaw, the worse, supposing the truth about
24390: that family to be the ugliest? His mother had braved hardship in order
24391: to separate herself from it. But if Dorothea’s friends had known this
24392: story—if the Chettams had known it—they would have had a fine color to
24393: give their suspicions a welcome ground for thinking him unfit to come
24394: near her. However, let them suspect what they pleased, they would find
24395: themselves in the wrong. They would find out that the blood in his
24396: veins was as free from the taint of meanness as theirs.
24397: 
24398: 
24399: 
24400: 
24401: CHAPTER LXI.
24402: 
24403: “Inconsistencies,” answered Imlac, “cannot both be right, but imputed
24404: to man they may both be true.”—_Rasselas_.
24405: 
24406: 
24407: The same night, when Mr. Bulstrode returned from a journey to Brassing
24408: on business, his good wife met him in the entrance-hall and drew him
24409: into his private sitting-room.
24410: 
24411: “Nicholas,” she said, fixing her honest eyes upon him anxiously, “there
24412: has been such a disagreeable man here asking for you—it has made me
24413: quite uncomfortable.”
24414: 
24415: “What kind of man, my dear,” said Mr. Bulstrode, dreadfully certain of
24416: the answer.
24417: 
24418: “A red-faced man with large whiskers, and most impudent in his manner.
24419: He declared he was an old friend of yours, and said you would be sorry
24420: not to see him. He wanted to wait for you here, but I told him he could
24421: see you at the Bank to-morrow morning. Most impudent he was!—stared at
24422: me, and said his friend Nick had luck in wives. I don’t believe he
24423: would have gone away, if Blucher had not happened to break his chain
24424: and come running round on the gravel—for I was in the garden; so I
24425: said, ‘You’d better go away—the dog is very fierce, and I can’t hold
24426: him.’ Do you really know anything of such a man?”
24427: 
24428: “I believe I know who he is, my dear,” said Mr. Bulstrode, in his usual
24429: subdued voice, “an unfortunate dissolute wretch, whom I helped too much
24430: in days gone by. However, I presume you will not be troubled by him
24431: again. He will probably come to the Bank—to beg, doubtless.”
24432: 
24433: No more was said on the subject until the next day, when Mr. Bulstrode
24434: had returned from the town and was dressing for dinner. His wife, not
24435: sure that he was come home, looked into his dressing-room and saw him
24436: with his coat and cravat off, leaning one arm on a chest of drawers and
24437: staring absently at the ground. He started nervously and looked up as
24438: she entered.
24439: 
24440: “You look very ill, Nicholas. Is there anything the matter?”
24441: 
24442: “I have a good deal of pain in my head,” said Mr. Bulstrode, who was so
24443: frequently ailing that his wife was always ready to believe in this
24444: cause of depression.
24445: 
24446: “Sit down and let me sponge it with vinegar.”
24447: 
24448: Physically Mr. Bulstrode did not want the vinegar, but morally the
24449: affectionate attention soothed him. Though always polite, it was his
24450: habit to receive such services with marital coolness, as his wife’s
24451: duty. But to-day, while she was bending over him, he said, “You are
24452: very good, Harriet,” in a tone which had something new in it to her
24453: ear; she did not know exactly what the novelty was, but her woman’s
24454: solicitude shaped itself into a darting thought that he might be going
24455: to have an illness.
24456: 
24457: “Has anything worried you?” she said. “Did that man come to you at the
24458: Bank?”
24459: 
24460: “Yes; it was as I had supposed. He is a man who at one time might have
24461: done better. But he has sunk into a drunken debauched creature.”
24462: 
24463: “Is he quite gone away?” said Mrs. Bulstrode, anxiously; but for
24464: certain reasons she refrained from adding, “It was very disagreeable to
24465: hear him calling himself a friend of yours.” At that moment she would
24466: not have liked to say anything which implied her habitual consciousness
24467: that her husband’s earlier connections were not quite on a level with
24468: her own. Not that she knew much about them. That her husband had at
24469: first been employed in a bank, that he had afterwards entered into what
24470: he called city business and gained a fortune before he was
24471: three-and-thirty, that he had married a widow who was much older than
24472: himself—a Dissenter, and in other ways probably of that disadvantageous
24473: quality usually perceptible in a first wife if inquired into with the
24474: dispassionate judgment of a second—was almost as much as she had cared
24475: to learn beyond the glimpses which Mr. Bulstrode’s narrative
24476: occasionally gave of his early bent towards religion, his inclination
24477: to be a preacher, and his association with missionary and philanthropic
24478: efforts. She believed in him as an excellent man whose piety carried a
24479: peculiar eminence in belonging to a layman, whose influence had turned
24480: her own mind toward seriousness, and whose share of perishable good had
24481: been the means of raising her own position. But she also liked to think
24482: that it was well in every sense for Mr. Bulstrode to have won the hand
24483: of Harriet Vincy; whose family was undeniable in a Middlemarch light—a
24484: better light surely than any thrown in London thoroughfares or
24485: dissenting chapel-yards. The unreformed provincial mind distrusted
24486: London; and while true religion was everywhere saving, honest Mrs.
24487: Bulstrode was convinced that to be saved in the Church was more
24488: respectable. She so much wished to ignore towards others that her
24489: husband had ever been a London Dissenter, that she liked to keep it out
24490: of sight even in talking to him. He was quite aware of this; indeed in
24491: some respects he was rather afraid of this ingenuous wife, whose
24492: imitative piety and native worldliness were equally sincere, who had
24493: nothing to be ashamed of, and whom he had married out of a thorough
24494: inclination still subsisting. But his fears were such as belong to a
24495: man who cares to maintain his recognized supremacy: the loss of high
24496: consideration from his wife, as from every one else who did not clearly
24497: hate him out of enmity to the truth, would be as the beginning of death
24498: to him. When she said—
24499: 
24500: “Is he quite gone away?”
24501: 
24502: “Oh, I trust so,” he answered, with an effort to throw as much sober
24503: unconcern into his tone as possible!
24504: 
24505: But in truth Mr. Bulstrode was very far from a state of quiet trust. In
24506: the interview at the Bank, Raffles had made it evident that his
24507: eagerness to torment was almost as strong in him as any other greed. He
24508: had frankly said that he had turned out of the way to come to
24509: Middlemarch, just to look about him and see whether the neighborhood
24510: would suit him to live in. He had certainly had a few debts to pay more
24511: than he expected, but the two hundred pounds were not gone yet: a cool
24512: five-and-twenty would suffice him to go away with for the present. What
24513: he had wanted chiefly was to see his friend Nick and family, and know
24514: all about the prosperity of a man to whom he was so much attached.
24515: By-and-by he might come back for a longer stay. This time Raffles
24516: declined to be “seen off the premises,” as he expressed it—declined to
24517: quit Middlemarch under Bulstrode’s eyes. He meant to go by coach the
24518: next day—if he chose.
24519: 
24520: Bulstrode felt himself helpless. Neither threats nor coaxing could
24521: avail: he could not count on any persistent fear nor on any promise. On
24522: the contrary, he felt a cold certainty at his heart that Raffles—unless
24523: providence sent death to hinder him—would come back to Middlemarch
24524: before long. And that certainty was a terror.
24525: 
24526: It was not that he was in danger of legal punishment or of beggary: he
24527: was in danger only of seeing disclosed to the judgment of his neighbors
24528: and the mournful perception of his wife certain facts of his past life
24529: which would render him an object of scorn and an opprobrium of the
24530: religion with which he had diligently associated himself. The terror of
24531: being judged sharpens the memory: it sends an inevitable glare over
24532: that long-unvisited past which has been habitually recalled only in
24533: general phrases. Even without memory, the life is bound into one by a
24534: zone of dependence in growth and decay; but intense memory forces a man
24535: to own his blameworthy past. With memory set smarting like a reopened
24536: wound, a man’s past is not simply a dead history, an outworn
24537: preparation of the present: it is not a repented error shaken loose
24538: from the life: it is a still quivering part of himself, bringing
24539: shudders and bitter flavors and the tinglings of a merited shame.
24540: 
24541: Into this second life Bulstrode’s past had now risen, only the
24542: pleasures of it seeming to have lost their quality. Night and day,
24543: without interruption save of brief sleep which only wove retrospect and
24544: fear into a fantastic present, he felt the scenes of his earlier life
24545: coming between him and everything else, as obstinately as when we look
24546: through the window from a lighted room, the objects we turn our backs
24547: on are still before us, instead of the grass and the trees. The
24548: successive events inward and outward were there in one view: though
24549: each might be dwelt on in turn, the rest still kept their hold in the
24550: consciousness.
24551: 
24552: Once more he saw himself the young banker’s clerk, with an agreeable
24553: person, as clever in figures as he was fluent in speech and fond of
24554: theological definition: an eminent though young member of a Calvinistic
24555: dissenting church at Highbury, having had striking experience in
24556: conviction of sin and sense of pardon. Again he heard himself called
24557: for as Brother Bulstrode in prayer meetings, speaking on religious
24558: platforms, preaching in private houses. Again he felt himself thinking
24559: of the ministry as possibly his vocation, and inclined towards
24560: missionary labor. That was the happiest time of his life: that was the
24561: spot he would have chosen now to awake in and find the rest a dream.
24562: The people among whom Brother Bulstrode was distinguished were very
24563: few, but they were very near to him, and stirred his satisfaction the
24564: more; his power stretched through a narrow space, but he felt its
24565: effect the more intensely. He believed without effort in the peculiar
24566: work of grace within him, and in the signs that God intended him for
24567: special instrumentality.
24568: 
24569: Then came the moment of transition; it was with the sense of promotion
24570: he had when he, an orphan educated at a commercial charity-school, was
24571: invited to a fine villa belonging to Mr. Dunkirk, the richest man in
24572: the congregation. Soon he became an intimate there, honored for his
24573: piety by the wife, marked out for his ability by the husband, whose
24574: wealth was due to a flourishing city and west-end trade. That was the
24575: setting-in of a new current for his ambition, directing his prospects
24576: of “instrumentality” towards the uniting of distinguished religious
24577: gifts with successful business.
24578: 
24579: By-and-by came a decided external leading: a confidential subordinate
24580: partner died, and nobody seemed to the principal so well fitted to fill
24581: the severely felt vacancy as his young friend Bulstrode, if he would
24582: become confidential accountant. The offer was accepted. The business
24583: was a pawnbroker’s, of the most magnificent sort both in extent and
24584: profits; and on a short acquaintance with it Bulstrode became aware
24585: that one source of magnificent profit was the easy reception of any
24586: goods offered, without strict inquiry as to where they came from. But
24587: there was a branch house at the west end, and no pettiness or dinginess
24588: to give suggestions of shame.
24589: 
24590: He remembered his first moments of shrinking. They were private, and
24591: were filled with arguments; some of these taking the form of prayer.
24592: The business was established and had old roots; is it not one thing to
24593: set up a new gin-palace and another to accept an investment in an old
24594: one? The profits made out of lost souls—where can the line be drawn at
24595: which they begin in human transactions? Was it not even God’s way of
24596: saving His chosen? “Thou knowest,”—the young Bulstrode had said then,
24597: as the older Bulstrode was saying now—“Thou knowest how loose my soul
24598: sits from these things—how I view them all as implements for tilling
24599: Thy garden rescued here and there from the wilderness.”
24600: 
24601: Metaphors and precedents were not wanting; peculiar spiritual
24602: experiences were not wanting which at last made the retention of his
24603: position seem a service demanded of him: the vista of a fortune had
24604: already opened itself, and Bulstrode’s shrinking remained private. Mr.
24605: Dunkirk had never expected that there would be any shrinking at all: he
24606: had never conceived that trade had anything to do with the scheme of
24607: salvation. And it was true that Bulstrode found himself carrying on two
24608: distinct lives; his religious activity could not be incompatible with
24609: his business as soon as he had argued himself into not feeling it
24610: incompatible.
24611: 
24612: Mentally surrounded with that past again, Bulstrode had the same
24613: pleas—indeed, the years had been perpetually spinning them into
24614: intricate thickness, like masses of spider-web, padding the moral
24615: sensibility; nay, as age made egoism more eager but less enjoying, his
24616: soul had become more saturated with the belief that he did everything
24617: for God’s sake, being indifferent to it for his own. And yet—if he
24618: could be back in that far-off spot with his youthful poverty—why, then
24619: he would choose to be a missionary.
24620: 
24621: But the train of causes in which he had locked himself went on. There
24622: was trouble in the fine villa at Highbury. Years before, the only
24623: daughter had run away, defied her parents, and gone on the stage; and
24624: now the only boy died, and after a short time Mr. Dunkirk died also.
24625: The wife, a simple pious woman, left with all the wealth in and out of
24626: the magnificent trade, of which she never knew the precise nature, had
24627: come to believe in Bulstrode, and innocently adore him as women often
24628: adore their priest or “man-made” minister. It was natural that after a
24629: time marriage should have been thought of between them. But Mrs.
24630: Dunkirk had qualms and yearnings about her daughter, who had long been
24631: regarded as lost both to God and her parents. It was known that the
24632: daughter had married, but she was utterly gone out of sight. The
24633: mother, having lost her boy, imagined a grandson, and wished in a
24634: double sense to reclaim her daughter. If she were found, there would be
24635: a channel for property—perhaps a wide one—in the provision for several
24636: grandchildren. Efforts to find her must be made before Mrs. Dunkirk
24637: would marry again. Bulstrode concurred; but after advertisement as well
24638: as other modes of inquiry had been tried, the mother believed that her
24639: daughter was not to be found, and consented to marry without
24640: reservation of property.
24641: 
24642: The daughter had been found; but only one man besides Bulstrode knew
24643: it, and he was paid for keeping silence and carrying himself away.
24644: 
24645: That was the bare fact which Bulstrode was now forced to see in the
24646: rigid outline with which acts present themselves to onlookers. But for
24647: himself at that distant time, and even now in burning memory, the fact
24648: was broken into little sequences, each justified as it came by
24649: reasonings which seemed to prove it righteous. Bulstrode’s course up to
24650: that time had, he thought, been sanctioned by remarkable providences,
24651: appearing to point the way for him to be the agent in making the best
24652: use of a large property and withdrawing it from perversion. Death and
24653: other striking dispositions, such as feminine trustfulness, had come;
24654: and Bulstrode would have adopted Cromwell’s words—“Do you call these
24655: bare events? The Lord pity you!” The events were comparatively small,
24656: but the essential condition was there—namely, that they were in favor
24657: of his own ends. It was easy for him to settle what was due from him to
24658: others by inquiring what were God’s intentions with regard to himself.
24659: Could it be for God’s service that this fortune should in any
24660: considerable proportion go to a young woman and her husband who were
24661: given up to the lightest pursuits, and might scatter it abroad in
24662: triviality—people who seemed to lie outside the path of remarkable
24663: providences? Bulstrode had never said to himself beforehand, “The
24664: daughter shall not be found”—nevertheless when the moment came he kept
24665: her existence hidden; and when other moments followed, he soothed the
24666: mother with consolation in the probability that the unhappy young woman
24667: might be no more.
24668: 
24669: There were hours in which Bulstrode felt that his action was
24670: unrighteous; but how could he go back? He had mental exercises, called
24671: himself nought, laid hold on redemption, and went on in his course of
24672: instrumentality. And after five years Death again came to widen his
24673: path, by taking away his wife. He did gradually withdraw his capital,
24674: but he did not make the sacrifices requisite to put an end to the
24675: business, which was carried on for thirteen years afterwards before it
24676: finally collapsed. Meanwhile Nicholas Bulstrode had used his hundred
24677: thousand discreetly, and was become provincially, solidly important—a
24678: banker, a Churchman, a public benefactor; also a sleeping partner in
24679: trading concerns, in which his ability was directed to economy in the
24680: raw material, as in the case of the dyes which rotted Mr. Vincy’s silk.
24681: And now, when this respectability had lasted undisturbed for nearly
24682: thirty years—when all that preceded it had long lain benumbed in the
24683: consciousness—that past had risen and immersed his thought as if with
24684: the terrible irruption of a new sense overburthening the feeble being.
24685: 
24686: Meanwhile, in his conversation with Raffles, he had learned something
24687: momentous, something which entered actively into the struggle of his
24688: longings and terrors. There, he thought, lay an opening towards
24689: spiritual, perhaps towards material rescue.
24690: 
24691: The spiritual kind of rescue was a genuine need with him. There may be
24692: coarse hypocrites, who consciously affect beliefs and emotions for the
24693: sake of gulling the world, but Bulstrode was not one of them. He was
24694: simply a man whose desires had been stronger than his theoretic
24695: beliefs, and who had gradually explained the gratification of his
24696: desires into satisfactory agreement with those beliefs. If this be
24697: hypocrisy, it is a process which shows itself occasionally in us all,
24698: to whatever confession we belong, and whether we believe in the future
24699: perfection of our race or in the nearest date fixed for the end of the
24700: world; whether we regard the earth as a putrefying nidus for a saved
24701: remnant, including ourselves, or have a passionate belief in the
24702: solidarity of mankind.
24703: 
24704: The service he could do to the cause of religion had been through life
24705: the ground he alleged to himself for his choice of action: it had been
24706: the motive which he had poured out in his prayers. Who would use money
24707: and position better than he meant to use them? Who could surpass him in
24708: self-abhorrence and exaltation of God’s cause? And to Mr. Bulstrode
24709: God’s cause was something distinct from his own rectitude of conduct:
24710: it enforced a discrimination of God’s enemies, who were to be used
24711: merely as instruments, and whom it would be as well if possible to keep
24712: out of money and consequent influence. Also, profitable investments in
24713: trades where the power of the prince of this world showed its most
24714: active devices, became sanctified by a right application of the profits
24715: in the hands of God’s servant.
24716: 
24717: This implicit reasoning is essentially no more peculiar to evangelical
24718: belief than the use of wide phrases for narrow motives is peculiar to
24719: Englishmen. There is no general doctrine which is not capable of eating
24720: out our morality if unchecked by the deep-seated habit of direct
24721: fellow-feeling with individual fellow-men.
24722: 
24723: But a man who believes in something else than his own greed, has
24724: necessarily a conscience or standard to which he more or less adapts
24725: himself. Bulstrode’s standard had been his serviceableness to God’s
24726: cause: “I am sinful and nought—a vessel to be consecrated by use—but
24727: use me!”—had been the mould into which he had constrained his immense
24728: need of being something important and predominating. And now had come a
24729: moment in which that mould seemed in danger of being broken and utterly
24730: cast away.
24731: 
24732: What if the acts he had reconciled himself to because they made him a
24733: stronger instrument of the divine glory, were to become the pretext of
24734: the scoffer, and a darkening of that glory? If this were to be the
24735: ruling of Providence, he was cast out from the temple as one who had
24736: brought unclean offerings.
24737: 
24738: He had long poured out utterances of repentance. But today a repentance
24739: had come which was of a bitterer flavor, and a threatening Providence
24740: urged him to a kind of propitiation which was not simply a doctrinal
24741: transaction. The divine tribunal had changed its aspect for him;
24742: self-prostration was no longer enough, and he must bring restitution in
24743: his hand. It was really before his God that Bulstrode was about to
24744: attempt such restitution as seemed possible: a great dread had seized
24745: his susceptible frame, and the scorching approach of shame wrought in
24746: him a new spiritual need. Night and day, while the resurgent
24747: threatening past was making a conscience within him, he was thinking by
24748: what means he could recover peace and trust—by what sacrifice he could
24749: stay the rod. His belief in these moments of dread was, that if he
24750: spontaneously did something right, God would save him from the
24751: consequences of wrong-doing. For religion can only change when the
24752: emotions which fill it are changed; and the religion of personal fear
24753: remains nearly at the level of the savage.
24754: 
24755: He had seen Raffles actually going away on the Brassing coach, and this
24756: was a temporary relief; it removed the pressure of an immediate dread,
24757: but did not put an end to the spiritual conflict and the need to win
24758: protection. At last he came to a difficult resolve, and wrote a letter
24759: to Will Ladislaw, begging him to be at the Shrubs that evening for a
24760: private interview at nine o’clock. Will had felt no particular surprise
24761: at the request, and connected it with some new notions about the
24762: “Pioneer;” but when he was shown into Mr. Bulstrode’s private room, he
24763: was struck with the painfully worn look on the banker’s face, and was
24764: going to say, “Are you ill?” when, checking himself in that abruptness,
24765: he only inquired after Mrs. Bulstrode, and her satisfaction with the
24766: picture bought for her.
24767: 
24768: “Thank you, she is quite satisfied; she has gone out with her daughters
24769: this evening. I begged you to come, Mr. Ladislaw, because I have a
24770: communication of a very private—indeed, I will say, of a sacredly
24771: confidential nature, which I desire to make to you. Nothing, I dare
24772: say, has been farther from your thoughts than that there had been
24773: important ties in the past which could connect your history with mine.”
24774: 
24775: Will felt something like an electric shock. He was already in a state
24776: of keen sensitiveness and hardly allayed agitation on the subject of
24777: ties in the past, and his presentiments were not agreeable. It seemed
24778: like the fluctuations of a dream—as if the action begun by that loud
24779: bloated stranger were being carried on by this pale-eyed sickly looking
24780: piece of respectability, whose subdued tone and glib formality of
24781: speech were at this moment almost as repulsive to him as their
24782: remembered contrast. He answered, with a marked change of color—
24783: 
24784: “No, indeed, nothing.”
24785: 
24786: “You see before you, Mr. Ladislaw, a man who is deeply stricken. But
24787: for the urgency of conscience and the knowledge that I am before the
24788: bar of One who seeth not as man seeth, I should be under no compulsion
24789: to make the disclosure which has been my object in asking you to come
24790: here to-night. So far as human laws go, you have no claim on me
24791: whatever.”
24792: 
24793: Will was even more uncomfortable than wondering. Mr. Bulstrode had
24794: paused, leaning his head on his hand, and looking at the floor. But he
24795: now fixed his examining glance on Will and said—
24796: 
24797: “I am told that your mother’s name was Sarah Dunkirk, and that she ran
24798: away from her friends to go on the stage. Also, that your father was at
24799: one time much emaciated by illness. May I ask if you can confirm these
24800: statements?”
24801: 
24802: “Yes, they are all true,” said Will, struck with the order in which an
24803: inquiry had come, that might have been expected to be preliminary to
24804: the banker’s previous hints. But Mr. Bulstrode had to-night followed
24805: the order of his emotions; he entertained no doubt that the opportunity
24806: for restitution had come, and he had an overpowering impulse towards
24807: the penitential expression by which he was deprecating chastisement.
24808: 
24809: “Do you know any particulars of your mother’s family?” he continued.
24810: 
24811: “No; she never liked to speak of them. She was a very generous,
24812: honorable woman,” said Will, almost angrily.
24813: 
24814: “I do not wish to allege anything against her. Did she never mention
24815: her mother to you at all?”
24816: 
24817: “I have heard her say that she thought her mother did not know the
24818: reason of her running away. She said ‘poor mother’ in a pitying tone.”
24819: 
24820: “That mother became my wife,” said Bulstrode, and then paused a moment
24821: before he added, “you have a claim on me, Mr. Ladislaw: as I said
24822: before, not a legal claim, but one which my conscience recognizes. I
24823: was enriched by that marriage—a result which would probably not have
24824: taken place—certainly not to the same extent—if your grandmother could
24825: have discovered her daughter. That daughter, I gather, is no longer
24826: living!”
24827: 
24828: “No,” said Will, feeling suspicion and repugnance rising so strongly
24829: within him, that without quite knowing what he did, he took his hat
24830: from the floor and stood up. The impulse within him was to reject the
24831: disclosed connection.
24832: 
24833: “Pray be seated, Mr. Ladislaw,” said Bulstrode, anxiously. “Doubtless
24834: you are startled by the suddenness of this discovery. But I entreat
24835: your patience with one who is already bowed down by inward trial.”
24836: 
24837: Will reseated himself, feeling some pity which was half contempt for
24838: this voluntary self-abasement of an elderly man.
24839: 
24840: “It is my wish, Mr. Ladislaw, to make amends for the deprivation which
24841: befell your mother. I know that you are without fortune, and I wish to
24842: supply you adequately from a store which would have probably already
24843: been yours had your grandmother been certain of your mother’s existence
24844: and been able to find her.”
24845: 
24846: Mr. Bulstrode paused. He felt that he was performing a striking piece
24847: of scrupulosity in the judgment of his auditor, and a penitential act
24848: in the eyes of God. He had no clew to the state of Will Ladislaw’s
24849: mind, smarting as it was from the clear hints of Raffles, and with its
24850: natural quickness in construction stimulated by the expectation of
24851: discoveries which he would have been glad to conjure back into
24852: darkness. Will made no answer for several moments, till Mr. Bulstrode,
24853: who at the end of his speech had cast his eyes on the floor, now raised
24854: them with an examining glance, which Will met fully, saying—
24855: 
24856: “I suppose you did know of my mother’s existence, and knew where she
24857: might have been found.”
24858: 
24859: Bulstrode shrank—there was a visible quivering in his face and hands.
24860: He was totally unprepared to have his advances met in this way, or to
24861: find himself urged into more revelation than he had beforehand set down
24862: as needful. But at that moment he dared not tell a lie, and he felt
24863: suddenly uncertain of his ground which he had trodden with some
24864: confidence before.
24865: 
24866: “I will not deny that you conjecture rightly,” he answered, with a
24867: faltering in his tone. “And I wish to make atonement to you as the one
24868: still remaining who has suffered a loss through me. You enter, I trust,
24869: into my purpose, Mr. Ladislaw, which has a reference to higher than
24870: merely human claims, and as I have already said, is entirely
24871: independent of any legal compulsion. I am ready to narrow my own
24872: resources and the prospects of my family by binding myself to allow you
24873: five hundred pounds yearly during my life, and to leave you a
24874: proportional capital at my death—nay, to do still more, if more should
24875: be definitely necessary to any laudable project on your part.” Mr.
24876: Bulstrode had gone on to particulars in the expectation that these
24877: would work strongly on Ladislaw, and merge other feelings in grateful
24878: acceptance.
24879: 
24880: But Will was looking as stubborn as possible, with his lip pouting and
24881: his fingers in his side-pockets. He was not in the least touched, and
24882: said firmly,—
24883: 
24884: “Before I make any reply to your proposition, Mr. Bulstrode, I must beg
24885: you to answer a question or two. Were you connected with the business
24886: by which that fortune you speak of was originally made?”
24887: 
24888: Mr. Bulstrode’s thought was, “Raffles has told him.” How could he
24889: refuse to answer when he had volunteered what drew forth the question?
24890: He answered, “Yes.”
24891: 
24892: “And was that business—or was it not—a thoroughly dishonorable one—nay,
24893: one that, if its nature had been made public, might have ranked those
24894: concerned in it with thieves and convicts?”
24895: 
24896: Will’s tone had a cutting bitterness: he was moved to put his question
24897: as nakedly as he could.
24898: 
24899: Bulstrode reddened with irrepressible anger. He had been prepared for a
24900: scene of self-abasement, but his intense pride and his habit of
24901: supremacy overpowered penitence, and even dread, when this young man,
24902: whom he had meant to benefit, turned on him with the air of a judge.
24903: 
24904: “The business was established before I became connected with it, sir;
24905: nor is it for you to institute an inquiry of that kind,” he answered,
24906: not raising his voice, but speaking with quick defiantness.
24907: 
24908: “Yes, it is,” said Will, starting up again with his hat in his hand.
24909: “It is eminently mine to ask such questions, when I have to decide
24910: whether I will have transactions with you and accept your money. My
24911: unblemished honor is important to me. It is important to me to have no
24912: stain on my birth and connections. And now I find there is a stain
24913: which I can’t help. My mother felt it, and tried to keep as clear of it
24914: as she could, and so will I. You shall keep your ill-gotten money. If I
24915: had any fortune of my own, I would willingly pay it to any one who
24916: could disprove what you have told me. What I have to thank you for is
24917: that you kept the money till now, when I can refuse it. It ought to lie
24918: with a man’s self that he is a gentleman. Good-night, sir.”
24919: 
24920: Bulstrode was going to speak, but Will, with determined quickness, was
24921: out of the room in an instant, and in another the hall-door had closed
24922: behind him. He was too strongly possessed with passionate rebellion
24923: against this inherited blot which had been thrust on his knowledge to
24924: reflect at present whether he had not been too hard on Bulstrode—too
24925: arrogantly merciless towards a man of sixty, who was making efforts at
24926: retrieval when time had rendered them vain.
24927: 
24928: No third person listening could have thoroughly understood the
24929: impetuosity of Will’s repulse or the bitterness of his words. No one
24930: but himself then knew how everything connected with the sentiment of
24931: his own dignity had an immediate bearing for him on his relation to
24932: Dorothea and to Mr. Casaubon’s treatment of him. And in the rush of
24933: impulses by which he flung back that offer of Bulstrode’s there was
24934: mingled the sense that it would have been impossible for him ever to
24935: tell Dorothea that he had accepted it.
24936: 
24937: As for Bulstrode—when Will was gone he suffered a violent reaction, and
24938: wept like a woman. It was the first time he had encountered an open
24939: expression of scorn from any man higher than Raffles; and with that
24940: scorn hurrying like venom through his system, there was no sensibility
24941: left to consolations. But the relief of weeping had to be checked. His
24942: wife and daughters soon came home from hearing the address of an
24943: Oriental missionary, and were full of regret that papa had not heard,
24944: in the first instance, the interesting things which they tried to
24945: repeat to him.
24946: 
24947: Perhaps, through all other hidden thoughts, the one that breathed most
24948: comfort was, that Will Ladislaw at least was not likely to publish what
24949: had taken place that evening.
24950: 
24951: 
24952: 
24953: 
24954: CHAPTER LXII.
24955: 
24956: He was a squyer of lowe degre,
24957: That loved the king’s daughter of Hungrie.
24958: —_Old Romance_.
24959: 
24960: 
24961: Will Ladislaw’s mind was now wholly bent on seeing Dorothea again, and
24962: forthwith quitting Middlemarch. The morning after his agitating scene
24963: with Bulstrode he wrote a brief letter to her, saying that various
24964: causes had detained him in the neighborhood longer than he had
24965: expected, and asking her permission to call again at Lowick at some
24966: hour which she would mention on the earliest possible day, he being
24967: anxious to depart, but unwilling to do so until she had granted him an
24968: interview. He left the letter at the office, ordering the messenger to
24969: carry it to Lowick Manor, and wait for an answer.
24970: 
24971: Ladislaw felt the awkwardness of asking for more last words. His former
24972: farewell had been made in the hearing of Sir James Chettam, and had
24973: been announced as final even to the butler. It is certainly trying to a
24974: man’s dignity to reappear when he is not expected to do so: a first
24975: farewell has pathos in it, but to come back for a second lends an
24976: opening to comedy, and it was possible even that there might be bitter
24977: sneers afloat about Will’s motives for lingering. Still it was on the
24978: whole more satisfactory to his feeling to take the directest means of
24979: seeing Dorothea, than to use any device which might give an air of
24980: chance to a meeting of which he wished her to understand that it was
24981: what he earnestly sought. When he had parted from her before, he had
24982: been in ignorance of facts which gave a new aspect to the relation
24983: between them, and made a more absolute severance than he had then
24984: believed in. He knew nothing of Dorothea’s private fortune, and being
24985: little used to reflect on such matters, took it for granted that
24986: according to Mr. Casaubon’s arrangement marriage to him, Will Ladislaw,
24987: would mean that she consented to be penniless. That was not what he
24988: could wish for even in his secret heart, or even if she had been ready
24989: to meet such hard contrast for his sake. And then, too, there was the
24990: fresh smart of that disclosure about his mother’s family, which if
24991: known would be an added reason why Dorothea’s friends should look down
24992: upon him as utterly below her. The secret hope that after some years he
24993: might come back with the sense that he had at least a personal value
24994: equal to her wealth, seemed now the dreamy continuation of a dream.
24995: This change would surely justify him in asking Dorothea to receive him
24996: once more.
24997: 
24998: But Dorothea on that morning was not at home to receive Will’s note. In
24999: consequence of a letter from her uncle announcing his intention to be
25000: at home in a week, she had driven first to Freshitt to carry the news,
25001: meaning to go on to the Grange to deliver some orders with which her
25002: uncle had intrusted her—thinking, as he said, “a little mental
25003: occupation of this sort good for a widow.”
25004: 
25005: If Will Ladislaw could have overheard some of the talk at Freshitt that
25006: morning, he would have felt all his suppositions confirmed as to the
25007: readiness of certain people to sneer at his lingering in the
25008: neighborhood. Sir James, indeed, though much relieved concerning
25009: Dorothea, had been on the watch to learn Ladislaw’s movements, and had
25010: an instructed informant in Mr. Standish, who was necessarily in his
25011: confidence on this matter. That Ladislaw had stayed in Middlemarch
25012: nearly two months after he had declared that he was going immediately,
25013: was a fact to embitter Sir James’s suspicions, or at least to justify
25014: his aversion to a “young fellow” whom he represented to himself as
25015: slight, volatile, and likely enough to show such recklessness as
25016: naturally went along with a position unriveted by family ties or a
25017: strict profession. But he had just heard something from Standish which,
25018: while it justified these surmises about Will, offered a means of
25019: nullifying all danger with regard to Dorothea.
25020: 
25021: Unwonted circumstances may make us all rather unlike ourselves: there
25022: are conditions under which the most majestic person is obliged to
25023: sneeze, and our emotions are liable to be acted on in the same
25024: incongruous manner. Good Sir James was this morning so far unlike
25025: himself that he was irritably anxious to say something to Dorothea on a
25026: subject which he usually avoided as if it had been a matter of shame to
25027: them both. He could not use Celia as a medium, because he did not
25028: choose that she should know the kind of gossip he had in his mind; and
25029: before Dorothea happened to arrive he had been trying to imagine how,
25030: with his shyness and unready tongue, he could ever manage to introduce
25031: his communication. Her unexpected presence brought him to utter
25032: hopelessness in his own power of saying anything unpleasant; but
25033: desperation suggested a resource; he sent the groom on an unsaddled
25034: horse across the park with a pencilled note to Mrs. Cadwallader, who
25035: already knew the gossip, and would think it no compromise of herself to
25036: repeat it as often as required.
25037: 
25038: Dorothea was detained on the good pretext that Mr. Garth, whom she
25039: wanted to see, was expected at the hall within the hour, and she was
25040: still talking to Caleb on the gravel when Sir James, on the watch for
25041: the rector’s wife, saw her coming and met her with the needful hints.
25042: 
25043: “Enough! I understand,”—said Mrs. Cadwallader. “You shall be innocent.
25044: I am such a blackamoor that I cannot smirch myself.”
25045: 
25046: “I don’t mean that it’s of any consequence,” said Sir James, disliking
25047: that Mrs. Cadwallader should understand too much. “Only it is desirable
25048: that Dorothea should know there are reasons why she should not receive
25049: him again; and I really can’t say so to her. It will come lightly from
25050: you.”
25051: 
25052: It came very lightly indeed. When Dorothea quitted Caleb and turned to
25053: meet them, it appeared that Mrs. Cadwallader had stepped across the
25054: park by the merest chance in the world, just to chat with Celia in a
25055: matronly way about the baby. And so Mr. Brooke was coming back?
25056: Delightful!—coming back, it was to be hoped, quite cured of
25057: Parliamentary fever and pioneering. Apropos of the “Pioneer”—somebody
25058: had prophesied that it would soon be like a dying dolphin, and turn all
25059: colors for want of knowing how to help itself, because Mr. Brooke’s
25060: protege, the brilliant young Ladislaw, was gone or going. Had Sir James
25061: heard that?
25062: 
25063: The three were walking along the gravel slowly, and Sir James, turning
25064: aside to whip a shrub, said he had heard something of that sort.
25065: 
25066: “All false!” said Mrs. Cadwallader. “He is not gone, or going,
25067: apparently; the ‘Pioneer’ keeps its color, and Mr. Orlando Ladislaw is
25068: making a sad dark-blue scandal by warbling continually with your Mr.
25069: Lydgate’s wife, who they tell me is as pretty as pretty can be. It
25070: seems nobody ever goes into the house without finding this young
25071: gentleman lying on the rug or warbling at the piano. But the people in
25072: manufacturing towns are always disreputable.”
25073: 
25074: “You began by saying that one report was false, Mrs. Cadwallader, and I
25075: believe this is false too,” said Dorothea, with indignant energy; “at
25076: least, I feel sure it is a misrepresentation. I will not hear any evil
25077: spoken of Mr. Ladislaw; he has already suffered too much injustice.”
25078: 
25079: Dorothea when thoroughly moved cared little what any one thought of her
25080: feelings; and even if she had been able to reflect, she would have held
25081: it petty to keep silence at injurious words about Will from fear of
25082: being herself misunderstood. Her face was flushed and her lip trembled.
25083: 
25084: Sir James, glancing at her, repented of his stratagem; but Mrs.
25085: Cadwallader, equal to all occasions, spread the palms of her hands
25086: outward and said—“Heaven grant it, my dear!—I mean that all bad tales
25087: about anybody may be false. But it is a pity that young Lydgate should
25088: have married one of these Middlemarch girls. Considering he’s a son of
25089: somebody, he might have got a woman with good blood in her veins, and
25090: not too young, who would have put up with his profession. There’s Clara
25091: Harfager, for instance, whose friends don’t know what to do with her;
25092: and she has a portion. Then we might have had her among us.
25093: However!—it’s no use being wise for other people. Where is Celia? Pray
25094: let us go in.”
25095: 
25096: “I am going on immediately to Tipton,” said Dorothea, rather haughtily.
25097: “Good-by.”
25098: 
25099: Sir James could say nothing as he accompanied her to the carriage. He
25100: was altogether discontented with the result of a contrivance which had
25101: cost him some secret humiliation beforehand.
25102: 
25103: Dorothea drove along between the berried hedgerows and the shorn
25104: corn-fields, not seeing or hearing anything around. The tears came and
25105: rolled down her cheeks, but she did not know it. The world, it seemed,
25106: was turning ugly and hateful, and there was no place for her
25107: trustfulness. “It is not true—it is not true!” was the voice within her
25108: that she listened to; but all the while a remembrance to which there
25109: had always clung a vague uneasiness would thrust itself on her
25110: attention—the remembrance of that day when she had found Will Ladislaw
25111: with Mrs. Lydgate, and had heard his voice accompanied by the piano.
25112: 
25113: “He said he would never do anything that I disapproved—I wish I could
25114: have told him that I disapproved of that,” said poor Dorothea,
25115: inwardly, feeling a strange alternation between anger with Will and the
25116: passionate defence of him. “They all try to blacken him before me; but
25117: I will care for no pain, if he is not to blame. I always believed he
25118: was good.”—These were her last thoughts before she felt that the
25119: carriage was passing under the archway of the lodge-gate at the Grange,
25120: when she hurriedly pressed her handkerchief to her face and began to
25121: think of her errands. The coachman begged leave to take out the horses
25122: for half an hour as there was something wrong with a shoe; and
25123: Dorothea, having the sense that she was going to rest, took off her
25124: gloves and bonnet, while she was leaning against a statue in the
25125: entrance-hall, and talking to the housekeeper. At last she said—
25126: 
25127: “I must stay here a little, Mrs. Kell. I will go into the library and
25128: write you some memoranda from my uncle’s letter, if you will open the
25129: shutters for me.”
25130: 
25131: “The shutters are open, madam,” said Mrs. Kell, following Dorothea, who
25132: had walked along as she spoke. “Mr. Ladislaw is there, looking for
25133: something.”
25134: 
25135: (Will had come to fetch a portfolio of his own sketches which he had
25136: missed in the act of packing his movables, and did not choose to leave
25137: behind.)
25138: 
25139: Dorothea’s heart seemed to turn over as if it had had a blow, but she
25140: was not perceptibly checked: in truth, the sense that Will was there
25141: was for the moment all-satisfying to her, like the sight of something
25142: precious that one has lost. When she reached the door she said to Mrs.
25143: Kell—
25144: 
25145: “Go in first, and tell him that I am here.”
25146: 
25147: Will had found his portfolio, and had laid it on the table at the far
25148: end of the room, to turn over the sketches and please himself by
25149: looking at the memorable piece of art which had a relation to nature
25150: too mysterious for Dorothea. He was smiling at it still, and shaking
25151: the sketches into order with the thought that he might find a letter
25152: from her awaiting him at Middlemarch, when Mrs. Kell close to his elbow
25153: said—
25154: 
25155: “Mrs. Casaubon is coming in, sir.”
25156: 
25157: Will turned round quickly, and the next moment Dorothea was entering.
25158: As Mrs. Kell closed the door behind her they met: each was looking at
25159: the other, and consciousness was overflowed by something that
25160: suppressed utterance. It was not confusion that kept them silent, for
25161: they both felt that parting was near, and there is no shamefacedness in
25162: a sad parting.
25163: 
25164: She moved automatically towards her uncle’s chair against the
25165: writing-table, and Will, after drawing it out a little for her, went a
25166: few paces off and stood opposite to her.
25167: 
25168: “Pray sit down,” said Dorothea, crossing her hands on her lap; “I am
25169: very glad you were here.” Will thought that her face looked just as it
25170: did when she first shook hands with him in Rome; for her widow’s cap,
25171: fixed in her bonnet, had gone off with it, and he could see that she
25172: had lately been shedding tears. But the mixture of anger in her
25173: agitation had vanished at the sight of him; she had been used, when
25174: they were face to face, always to feel confidence and the happy freedom
25175: which comes with mutual understanding, and how could other people’s
25176: words hinder that effect on a sudden? Let the music which can take
25177: possession of our frame and fill the air with joy for us, sound once
25178: more—what does it signify that we heard it found fault with in its
25179: absence?
25180: 
25181: “I have sent a letter to Lowick Manor to-day, asking leave to see you,”
25182: said Will, seating himself opposite to her. “I am going away
25183: immediately, and I could not go without speaking to you again.”
25184: 
25185: “I thought we had parted when you came to Lowick many weeks ago—you
25186: thought you were going then,” said Dorothea, her voice trembling a
25187: little.
25188: 
25189: “Yes; but I was in ignorance then of things which I know now—things
25190: which have altered my feelings about the future. When I saw you before,
25191: I was dreaming that I might come back some day. I don’t think I ever
25192: shall—now.” Will paused here.
25193: 
25194: “You wished me to know the reasons?” said Dorothea, timidly.
25195: 
25196: “Yes,” said Will, impetuously, shaking his head backward, and looking
25197: away from her with irritation in his face. “Of course I must wish it. I
25198: have been grossly insulted in your eyes and in the eyes of others.
25199: There has been a mean implication against my character. I wish you to
25200: know that under no circumstances would I have lowered myself by—under
25201: no circumstances would I have given men the chance of saying that I
25202: sought money under the pretext of seeking—something else. There was no
25203: need of other safeguard against me—the safeguard of wealth was enough.”
25204: 
25205: Will rose from his chair with the last word and went—he hardly knew
25206: where; but it was to the projecting window nearest him, which had been
25207: open as now about the same season a year ago, when he and Dorothea had
25208: stood within it and talked together. Her whole heart was going out at
25209: this moment in sympathy with Will’s indignation: she only wanted to
25210: convince him that she had never done him injustice, and he seemed to
25211: have turned away from her as if she too had been part of the unfriendly
25212: world.
25213: 
25214: “It would be very unkind of you to suppose that I ever attributed any
25215: meanness to you,” she began. Then in her ardent way, wanting to plead
25216: with him, she moved from her chair and went in front of him to her old
25217: place in the window, saying, “Do you suppose that I ever disbelieved in
25218: you?”
25219: 
25220: When Will saw her there, he gave a start and moved backward out of the
25221: window, without meeting her glance. Dorothea was hurt by this movement
25222: following up the previous anger of his tone. She was ready to say that
25223: it was as hard on her as on him, and that she was helpless; but those
25224: strange particulars of their relation which neither of them could
25225: explicitly mention kept her always in dread of saying too much. At this
25226: moment she had no belief that Will would in any case have wanted to
25227: marry her, and she feared using words which might imply such a belief.
25228: She only said earnestly, recurring to his last word—
25229: 
25230: “I am sure no safeguard was ever needed against you.”
25231: 
25232: Will did not answer. In the stormy fluctuation of his feelings these
25233: words of hers seemed to him cruelly neutral, and he looked pale and
25234: miserable after his angry outburst. He went to the table and fastened
25235: up his portfolio, while Dorothea looked at him from the distance. They
25236: were wasting these last moments together in wretched silence. What
25237: could he say, since what had got obstinately uppermost in his mind was
25238: the passionate love for her which he forbade himself to utter? What
25239: could she say, since she might offer him no help—since she was forced
25240: to keep the money that ought to have been his?—since to-day he seemed
25241: not to respond as he used to do to her thorough trust and liking?
25242: 
25243: But Will at last turned away from his portfolio and approached the
25244: window again.
25245: 
25246: “I must go,” he said, with that peculiar look of the eyes which
25247: sometimes accompanies bitter feeling, as if they had been tired and
25248: burned with gazing too close at a light.
25249: 
25250: “What shall you do in life?” said Dorothea, timidly. “Have your
25251: intentions remained just the same as when we said good-by before?”
25252: 
25253: “Yes,” said Will, in a tone that seemed to waive the subject as
25254: uninteresting. “I shall work away at the first thing that offers. I
25255: suppose one gets a habit of doing without happiness or hope.”
25256: 
25257: “Oh, what sad words!” said Dorothea, with a dangerous tendency to sob.
25258: Then trying to smile, she added, “We used to agree that we were alike
25259: in speaking too strongly.”
25260: 
25261: “I have not spoken too strongly now,” said Will, leaning back against
25262: the angle of the wall. “There are certain things which a man can only
25263: go through once in his life; and he must know some time or other that
25264: the best is over with him. This experience has happened to me while I
25265: am very young—that is all. What I care more for than I can ever care
25266: for anything else is absolutely forbidden to me—I don’t mean merely by
25267: being out of my reach, but forbidden me, even if it were within my
25268: reach, by my own pride and honor—by everything I respect myself for. Of
25269: course I shall go on living as a man might do who had seen heaven in a
25270: trance.”
25271: 
25272: Will paused, imagining that it would be impossible for Dorothea to
25273: misunderstand this; indeed he felt that he was contradicting himself
25274: and offending against his self-approval in speaking to her so plainly;
25275: but still—it could not be fairly called wooing a woman to tell her that
25276: he would never woo her. It must be admitted to be a ghostly kind of
25277: wooing.
25278: 
25279: But Dorothea’s mind was rapidly going over the past with quite another
25280: vision than his. The thought that she herself might be what Will most
25281: cared for did throb through her an instant, but then came doubt: the
25282: memory of the little they had lived through together turned pale and
25283: shrank before the memory which suggested how much fuller might have
25284: been the intercourse between Will and some one else with whom he had
25285: had constant companionship. Everything he had said might refer to that
25286: other relation, and whatever had passed between him and herself was
25287: thoroughly explained by what she had always regarded as their simple
25288: friendship and the cruel obstruction thrust upon it by her husband’s
25289: injurious act. Dorothea stood silent, with her eyes cast down dreamily,
25290: while images crowded upon her which left the sickening certainty that
25291: Will was referring to Mrs. Lydgate. But why sickening? He wanted her to
25292: know that here too his conduct should be above suspicion.
25293: 
25294: Will was not surprised at her silence. His mind also was tumultuously
25295: busy while he watched her, and he was feeling rather wildly that
25296: something must happen to hinder their parting—some miracle, clearly
25297: nothing in their own deliberate speech. Yet, after all, had she any
25298: love for him?—he could not pretend to himself that he would rather
25299: believe her to be without that pain. He could not deny that a secret
25300: longing for the assurance that she loved him was at the root of all his
25301: words.
25302: 
25303: Neither of them knew how long they stood in that way. Dorothea was
25304: raising her eyes, and was about to speak, when the door opened and her
25305: footman came to say—
25306: 
25307: “The horses are ready, madam, whenever you like to start.”
25308: 
25309: “Presently,” said Dorothea. Then turning to Will, she said, “I have
25310: some memoranda to write for the housekeeper.”
25311: 
25312: “I must go,” said Will, when the door had closed again—advancing
25313: towards her. “The day after to-morrow I shall leave Middlemarch.”
25314: 
25315: “You have acted in every way rightly,” said Dorothea, in a low tone,
25316: feeling a pressure at her heart which made it difficult to speak.
25317: 
25318: She put out her hand, and Will took it for an instant without speaking,
25319: for her words had seemed to him cruelly cold and unlike herself. Their
25320: eyes met, but there was discontent in his, and in hers there was only
25321: sadness. He turned away and took his portfolio under his arm.
25322: 
25323: “I have never done you injustice. Please remember me,” said Dorothea,
25324: repressing a rising sob.
25325: 
25326: “Why should you say that?” said Will, with irritation. “As if I were
25327: not in danger of forgetting everything else.”
25328: 
25329: He had really a movement of anger against her at that moment, and it
25330: impelled him to go away without pause. It was all one flash to
25331: Dorothea—his last words—his distant bow to her as he reached the
25332: door—the sense that he was no longer there. She sank into the chair,
25333: and for a few moments sat like a statue, while images and emotions were
25334: hurrying upon her. Joy came first, in spite of the threatening train
25335: behind it—joy in the impression that it was really herself whom Will
25336: loved and was renouncing, that there was really no other love less
25337: permissible, more blameworthy, which honor was hurrying him away from.
25338: They were parted all the same, but—Dorothea drew a deep breath and felt
25339: her strength return—she could think of him unrestrainedly. At that
25340: moment the parting was easy to bear: the first sense of loving and
25341: being loved excluded sorrow. It was as if some hard icy pressure had
25342: melted, and her consciousness had room to expand: her past was come
25343: back to her with larger interpretation. The joy was not the
25344: less—perhaps it was the more complete just then—because of the
25345: irrevocable parting; for there was no reproach, no contemptuous wonder
25346: to imagine in any eye or from any lips. He had acted so as to defy
25347: reproach, and make wonder respectful.
25348: 
25349: Any one watching her might have seen that there was a fortifying
25350: thought within her. Just as when inventive power is working with glad
25351: ease some small claim on the attention is fully met as if it were only
25352: a cranny opened to the sunlight, it was easy now for Dorothea to write
25353: her memoranda. She spoke her last words to the housekeeper in cheerful
25354: tones, and when she seated herself in the carriage her eyes were bright
25355: and her cheeks blooming under the dismal bonnet. She threw back the
25356: heavy “weepers,” and looked before her, wondering which road Will had
25357: taken. It was in her nature to be proud that he was blameless, and
25358: through all her feelings there ran this vein—“I was right to defend
25359: him.”
25360: 
25361: The coachman was used to drive his grays at a good pace, Mr. Casaubon
25362: being unenjoying and impatient in everything away from his desk, and
25363: wanting to get to the end of all journeys; and Dorothea was now bowled
25364: along quickly. Driving was pleasant, for rain in the night had laid the
25365: dust, and the blue sky looked far off, away from the region of the
25366: great clouds that sailed in masses. The earth looked like a happy place
25367: under the vast heavens, and Dorothea was wishing that she might
25368: overtake Will and see him once more.
25369: 
25370: After a turn of the road, there he was with the portfolio under his
25371: arm; but the next moment she was passing him while he raised his hat,
25372: and she felt a pang at being seated there in a sort of exaltation,
25373: leaving him behind. She could not look back at him. It was as if a
25374: crowd of indifferent objects had thrust them asunder, and forced them
25375: along different paths, taking them farther and farther away from each
25376: other, and making it useless to look back. She could no more make any
25377: sign that would seem to say, “Need we part?” than she could stop the
25378: carriage to wait for him. Nay, what a world of reasons crowded upon her
25379: against any movement of her thought towards a future that might reverse
25380: the decision of this day!
25381: 
25382: “I only wish I had known before—I wish he knew—then we could be quite
25383: happy in thinking of each other, though we are forever parted. And if I
25384: could but have given him the money, and made things easier for
25385: him!”—were the longings that came back the most persistently. And yet,
25386: so heavily did the world weigh on her in spite of her independent
25387: energy, that with this idea of Will as in need of such help and at a
25388: disadvantage with the world, there came always the vision of that
25389: unfittingness of any closer relation between them which lay in the
25390: opinion of every one connected with her. She felt to the full all the
25391: imperativeness of the motives which urged Will’s conduct. How could he
25392: dream of her defying the barrier that her husband had placed between
25393: them?—how could she ever say to herself that she would defy it?
25394: 
25395: Will’s certainty as the carriage grew smaller in the distance, had much
25396: more bitterness in it. Very slight matters were enough to gall him in
25397: his sensitive mood, and the sight of Dorothea driving past him while he
25398: felt himself plodding along as a poor devil seeking a position in a
25399: world which in his present temper offered him little that he coveted,
25400: made his conduct seem a mere matter of necessity, and took away the
25401: sustainment of resolve. After all, he had no assurance that she loved
25402: him: could any man pretend that he was simply glad in such a case to
25403: have the suffering all on his own side?
25404: 
25405: That evening Will spent with the Lydgates; the next evening he was
25406: gone.

25420: 
25421: 
25422: “Have you seen much of your scientific phoenix, Lydgate, lately?” said
25423: Mr. Toller at one of his Christmas dinner-parties, speaking to Mr.
25424: Farebrother on his right hand.
25425: 
25426: “Not much, I am sorry to say,” answered the Vicar, accustomed to parry
25427: Mr. Toller’s banter about his belief in the new medical light. “I am
25428: out of the way and he is too busy.”
25429: 
25430: “Is he? I am glad to hear it,” said Dr. Minchin, with mingled suavity
25431: and surprise.
25432: 
25433: “He gives a great deal of time to the New Hospital,” said Mr.
25434: Farebrother, who had his reasons for continuing the subject: “I hear of
25435: that from my neighbor, Mrs. Casaubon, who goes there often. She says
25436: Lydgate is indefatigable, and is making a fine thing of Bulstrode’s
25437: institution. He is preparing a new ward in case of the cholera coming
25438: to us.”
25439: 
25440: “And preparing theories of treatment to try on the patients, I
25441: suppose,” said Mr. Toller.
25442: 
25443: “Come, Toller, be candid,” said Mr. Farebrother. “You are too clever
25444: not to see the good of a bold fresh mind in medicine, as well as in
25445: everything else; and as to cholera, I fancy, none of you are very sure
25446: what you ought to do. If a man goes a little too far along a new road,
25447: it is usually himself that he harms more than any one else.”
25448: 
25449: “I am sure you and Wrench ought to be obliged to him,” said Dr.
25450: Minchin, looking towards Toller, “for he has sent you the cream of
25451: Peacock’s patients.”
25452: 
25453: “Lydgate has been living at a great rate for a young beginner,” said
25454: Mr. Harry Toller, the brewer. “I suppose his relations in the North
25455: back him up.”
25456: 
25457: “I hope so,” said Mr. Chichely, “else he ought not to have married that
25458: nice girl we were all so fond of. Hang it, one has a grudge against a
25459: man who carries off the prettiest girl in the town.”
25460: 
25461: “Ay, by God! and the best too,” said Mr. Standish.
25462: 
25463: “My friend Vincy didn’t half like the marriage, I know that,” said Mr.
25464: Chichely. “_He_ wouldn’t do much. How the relations on the other side
25465: may have come down I can’t say.” There was an emphatic kind of
25466: reticence in Mr. Chichely’s manner of speaking.
25467: 
25468: “Oh, I shouldn’t think Lydgate ever looked to practice for a living,”
25469: said Mr. Toller, with a slight touch of sarcasm, and there the subject
25470: was dropped.
25471: 
25472: This was not the first time that Mr. Farebrother had heard hints of
25473: Lydgate’s expenses being obviously too great to be met by his practice,
25474: but he thought it not unlikely that there were resources or
25475: expectations which excused the large outlay at the time of Lydgate’s
25476: marriage, and which might hinder any bad consequences from the
25477: disappointment in his practice. One evening, when he took the pains to
25478: go to Middlemarch on purpose to have a chat with Lydgate as of old, he
25479: noticed in him an air of excited effort quite unlike his usual easy way
25480: of keeping silence or breaking it with abrupt energy whenever he had
25481: anything to say. Lydgate talked persistently when they were in his
25482: work-room, putting arguments for and against the probability of certain
25483: biological views; but he had none of those definite things to say or to
25484: show which give the waymarks of a patient uninterrupted pursuit, such
25485: as he used himself to insist on, saying that “there must be a systole
25486: and diastole in all inquiry,” and that “a man’s mind must be
25487: continually expanding and shrinking between the whole human horizon and
25488: the horizon of an object-glass.” That evening he seemed to be talking
25489: widely for the sake of resisting any personal bearing; and before long
25490: they went into the drawing room, where Lydgate, having asked Rosamond
25491: to give them music, sank back in his chair in silence, but with a
25492: strange light in his eyes. “He may have been taking an opiate,” was a
25493: thought that crossed Mr. Farebrother’s mind—“tic-douloureux perhaps—or
25494: medical worries.”
25495: 
25496: It did not occur to him that Lydgate’s marriage was not delightful: he
25497: believed, as the rest did, that Rosamond was an amiable, docile
25498: creature, though he had always thought her rather uninteresting—a
25499: little too much the pattern-card of the finishing-school; and his
25500: mother could not forgive Rosamond because she never seemed to see that
25501: Henrietta Noble was in the room. “However, Lydgate fell in love with
25502: her,” said the Vicar to himself, “and she must be to his taste.”
25503: 
25504: Mr. Farebrother was aware that Lydgate was a proud man, but having very
25505: little corresponding fibre in himself, and perhaps too little care
25506: about personal dignity, except the dignity of not being mean or
25507: foolish, he could hardly allow enough for the way in which Lydgate
25508: shrank, as from a burn, from the utterance of any word about his
25509: private affairs. And soon after that conversation at Mr. Toller’s, the
25510: Vicar learned something which made him watch the more eagerly for an
25511: opportunity of indirectly letting Lydgate know that if he wanted to
25512: open himself about any difficulty there was a friendly ear ready.
25513: 
25514: The opportunity came at Mr. Vincy’s, where, on New Year’s Day, there
25515: was a party, to which Mr. Farebrother was irresistibly invited, on the
25516: plea that he must not forsake his old friends on the first new year of
25517: his being a greater man, and Rector as well as Vicar. And this party
25518: was thoroughly friendly: all the ladies of the Farebrother family were
25519: present; the Vincy children all dined at the table, and Fred had
25520: persuaded his mother that if she did not invite Mary Garth, the
25521: Farebrothers would regard it as a slight to themselves, Mary being
25522: their particular friend. Mary came, and Fred was in high spirits,
25523: though his enjoyment was of a checkered kind—triumph that his mother
25524: should see Mary’s importance with the chief personages in the party
25525: being much streaked with jealousy when Mr. Farebrother sat down by her.
25526: Fred used to be much more easy about his own accomplishments in the
25527: days when he had not begun to dread being “bowled out by Farebrother,”
25528: and this terror was still before him. Mrs. Vincy, in her fullest
25529: matronly bloom, looked at Mary’s little figure, rough wavy hair, and
25530: visage quite without lilies and roses, and wondered; trying
25531: unsuccessfully to fancy herself caring about Mary’s appearance in
25532: wedding clothes, or feeling complacency in grandchildren who would
25533: “feature” the Garths. However, the party was a merry one, and Mary was
25534: particularly bright; being glad, for Fred’s sake, that his friends were
25535: getting kinder to her, and being also quite willing that they should
25536: see how much she was valued by others whom they must admit to be
25537: judges.
25538: 
25539: Mr. Farebrother noticed that Lydgate seemed bored, and that Mr. Vincy
25540: spoke as little as possible to his son-in-law. Rosamond was perfectly
25541: graceful and calm, and only a subtle observation such as the Vicar had
25542: not been roused to bestow on her would have perceived the total absence
25543: of that interest in her husband’s presence which a loving wife is sure
25544: to betray, even if etiquette keeps her aloof from him. When Lydgate was
25545: taking part in the conversation, she never looked towards him any more
25546: than if she had been a sculptured Psyche modelled to look another way:
25547: and when, after being called out for an hour or two, he re-entered the
25548: room, she seemed unconscious of the fact, which eighteen months before
25549: would have had the effect of a numeral before ciphers. In reality,
25550: however, she was intensely aware of Lydgate’s voice and movements; and
25551: her pretty good-tempered air of unconsciousness was a studied negation
25552: by which she satisfied her inward opposition to him without compromise
25553: of propriety. When the ladies were in the drawing-room after Lydgate
25554: had been called away from the dessert, Mrs. Farebrother, when Rosamond
25555: happened to be near her, said—“You have to give up a great deal of your
25556: husband’s society, Mrs. Lydgate.”
25557: 
25558: “Yes, the life of a medical man is very arduous: especially when he is
25559: so devoted to his profession as Mr. Lydgate is,” said Rosamond, who was
25560: standing, and moved easily away at the end of this correct little
25561: speech.
25562: 
25563: “It is dreadfully dull for her when there is no company,” said Mrs.
25564: Vincy, who was seated at the old lady’s side. “I am sure I thought so
25565: when Rosamond was ill, and I was staying with her. You know, Mrs.
25566: Farebrother, ours is a cheerful house. I am of a cheerful disposition
25567: myself, and Mr. Vincy always likes something to be going on. That is
25568: what Rosamond has been used to. Very different from a husband out at
25569: odd hours, and never knowing when he will come home, and of a close,
25570: proud disposition, _I_ think”—indiscreet Mrs. Vincy did lower her tone
25571: slightly with this parenthesis. “But Rosamond always had an angel of a
25572: temper; her brothers used very often not to please her, but she was
25573: never the girl to show temper; from a baby she was always as good as
25574: good, and with a complexion beyond anything. But my children are all
25575: good-tempered, thank God.”
25576: 
25577: This was easily credible to any one looking at Mrs. Vincy as she threw
25578: back her broad cap-strings, and smiled towards her three little girls,
25579: aged from seven to eleven. But in that smiling glance she was obliged
25580: to include Mary Garth, whom the three girls had got into a corner to
25581: make her tell them stories. Mary was just finishing the delicious tale
25582: of Rumpelstiltskin, which she had well by heart, because Letty was
25583: never tired of communicating it to her ignorant elders from a favorite
25584: red volume. Louisa, Mrs. Vincy’s darling, now ran to her with wide-eyed
25585: serious excitement, crying, “Oh mamma, mamma, the little man stamped so
25586: hard on the floor he couldn’t get his leg out again!”
25587: 
25588: “Bless you, my cherub!” said mamma; “you shall tell me all about it
25589: to-morrow. Go and listen!” and then, as her eyes followed Louisa back
25590: towards the attractive corner, she thought that if Fred wished her to
25591: invite Mary again she would make no objection, the children being so
25592: pleased with her.
25593: 
25594: But presently the corner became still more animated, for Mr.
25595: Farebrother came in, and seating himself behind Louisa, took her on his
25596: lap; whereupon the girls all insisted that he must hear
25597: Rumpelstiltskin, and Mary must tell it over again. He insisted too, and
25598: Mary, without fuss, began again in her neat fashion, with precisely the
25599: same words as before. Fred, who had also seated himself near, would
25600: have felt unmixed triumph in Mary’s effectiveness if Mr. Farebrother
25601: had not been looking at her with evident admiration, while he
25602: dramatized an intense interest in the tale to please the children.
25603: 
25604: “You will never care any more about my one-eyed giant, Loo,” said Fred
25605: at the end.
25606: 
25607: “Yes, I shall. Tell about him now,” said Louisa.
25608: 
25609: “Oh, I dare say; I am quite cut out. Ask Mr. Farebrother.”
25610: 
25611: “Yes,” added Mary; “ask Mr. Farebrother to tell you about the ants
25612: whose beautiful house was knocked down by a giant named Tom, and he
25613: thought they didn’t mind because he couldn’t hear them cry, or see them
25614: use their pocket-handkerchiefs.”
25615: 
25616: “Please,” said Louisa, looking up at the Vicar.
25617: 
25618: “No, no, I am a grave old parson. If I try to draw a story out of my
25619: bag a sermon comes instead. Shall I preach you a sermon?” said he,
25620: putting on his short-sighted glasses, and pursing up his lips.
25621: 
25622: “Yes,” said Louisa, falteringly.
25623: 
25624: “Let me see, then. Against cakes: how cakes are bad things, especially
25625: if they are sweet and have plums in them.”
25626: 
25627: Louisa took the affair rather seriously, and got down from the Vicar’s
25628: knee to go to Fred.
25629: 
25630: “Ah, I see it will not do to preach on New Year’s Day,” said Mr.
25631: Farebrother, rising and walking away. He had discovered of late that
25632: Fred had become jealous of him, and also that he himself was not losing
25633: his preference for Mary above all other women.
25634: 
25635: “A delightful young person is Miss Garth,” said Mrs. Farebrother, who
25636: had been watching her son’s movements.
25637: 
25638: “Yes,” said Mrs. Vincy, obliged to reply, as the old lady turned to her
25639: expectantly. “It is a pity she is not better-looking.”
25640: 
25641: “I cannot say that,” said Mrs. Farebrother, decisively. “I like her
25642: countenance. We must not always ask for beauty, when a good God has
25643: seen fit to make an excellent young woman without it. I put good
25644: manners first, and Miss Garth will know how to conduct herself in any
25645: station.”
25646: 
25647: The old lady was a little sharp in her tone, having a prospective
25648: reference to Mary’s becoming her daughter-in-law; for there was this
25649: inconvenience in Mary’s position with regard to Fred, that it was not
25650: suitable to be made public, and hence the three ladies at Lowick
25651: Parsonage were still hoping that Camden would choose Miss Garth.
25652: 
25653: New visitors entered, and the drawing-room was given up to music and
25654: games, while whist-tables were prepared in the quiet room on the other
25655: side of the hall. Mr. Farebrother played a rubber to satisfy his
25656: mother, who regarded her occasional whist as a protest against scandal
25657: and novelty of opinion, in which light even a revoke had its dignity.
25658: But at the end he got Mr. Chichely to take his place, and left the
25659: room. As he crossed the hall, Lydgate had just come in and was taking
25660: off his great-coat.
25661: 
25662: “You are the man I was going to look for,” said the Vicar; and instead
25663: of entering the drawing-room, they walked along the hall and stood
25664: against the fireplace, where the frosty air helped to make a glowing
25665: bank. “You see, I can leave the whist-table easily enough,” he went on,
25666: smiling at Lydgate, “now I don’t play for money. I owe that to you,
25667: Mrs. Casaubon says.”
25668: 
25669: “How?” said Lydgate, coldly.
25670: 
25671: “Ah, you didn’t mean me to know it; I call that ungenerous reticence.
25672: You should let a man have the pleasure of feeling that you have done
25673: him a good turn. I don’t enter into some people’s dislike of being
25674: under an obligation: upon my word, I prefer being under an obligation
25675: to everybody for behaving well to me.”
25676: 
25677: “I can’t tell what you mean,” said Lydgate, “unless it is that I once
25678: spoke of you to Mrs. Casaubon. But I did not think that she would break
25679: her promise not to mention that I had done so,” said Lydgate, leaning
25680: his back against the corner of the mantel-piece, and showing no
25681: radiance in his face.
25682: 
25683: “It was Brooke who let it out, only the other day. He paid me the
25684: compliment of saying that he was very glad I had the living though you
25685: had come across his tactics, and had praised me up as a Ken and a
25686: Tillotson, and that sort of thing, till Mrs. Casaubon would hear of no
25687: one else.”
25688: 
25689: “Oh, Brooke is such a leaky-minded fool,” said Lydgate, contemptuously.
25690: 
25691: “Well, I was glad of the leakiness then. I don’t see why you shouldn’t
25692: like me to know that you wished to do me a service, my dear fellow. And
25693: you certainly have done me one. It’s rather a strong check to one’s
25694: self-complacency to find how much of one’s right doing depends on not
25695: being in want of money. A man will not be tempted to say the Lord’s
25696: Prayer backward to please the devil, if he doesn’t want the devil’s
25697: services. I have no need to hang on the smiles of chance now.”
25698: 
25699: “I don’t see that there’s any money-getting without chance,” said
25700: Lydgate; “if a man gets it in a profession, it’s pretty sure to come by
25701: chance.”
25702: 
25703: Mr. Farebrother thought he could account for this speech, in striking
25704: contrast with Lydgate’s former way of talking, as the perversity which
25705: will often spring from the moodiness of a man ill at ease in his
25706: affairs. He answered in a tone of good-humored admission—
25707: 
25708: “Ah, there’s enormous patience wanted with the way of the world. But it
25709: is the easier for a man to wait patiently when he has friends who love
25710: him, and ask for nothing better than to help him through, so far as it
25711: lies in their power.”
25712: 
25713: “Oh yes,” said Lydgate, in a careless tone, changing his attitude and
25714: looking at his watch. “People make much more of their difficulties than
25715: they need to do.”
25716: 
25717: He knew as distinctly as possible that this was an offer of help to
25718: himself from Mr. Farebrother, and he could not bear it. So strangely
25719: determined are we mortals, that, after having been long gratified with
25720: the sense that he had privately done the Vicar a service, the
25721: suggestion that the Vicar discerned his need of a service in return
25722: made him shrink into unconquerable reticence. Besides, behind all
25723: making of such offers what else must come?—that he should “mention his
25724: case,” imply that he wanted specific things. At that moment, suicide
25725: seemed easier.
25726: 
25727: Mr. Farebrother was too keen a man not to know the meaning of that
25728: reply, and there was a certain massiveness in Lydgate’s manner and
25729: tone, corresponding with his physique, which if he repelled your
25730: advances in the first instance seemed to put persuasive devices out of
25731: question.
25732: 
25733: “What time are you?” said the Vicar, devouring his wounded feeling.
25734: 
25735: “After eleven,” said Lydgate. And they went into the drawing-room.
25736: 
25737: 
25738: 
25739: 
25740: CHAPTER LXIV.
25741: 
25742: 1_st Gent_. Where lies the power, there let the blame lie too.
25743: 
25744: 2_d Gent_. Nay, power is relative; you cannot fright
25745:     The coming pest with border fortresses,
25746:     Or catch your carp with subtle argument.
25747:     All force is twain in one: cause is not cause
25748:     Unless effect be there; and action’s self
25749:     Must needs contain a passive. So command
25750:     Exists but with obedience.
25751: 
25752: 
25753: Even if Lydgate had been inclined to be quite open about his affairs,
25754: he knew that it would have hardly been in Mr. Farebrother’s power to
25755: give him the help he immediately wanted. With the year’s bills coming
25756: in from his tradesmen, with Dover’s threatening hold on his furniture,
25757: and with nothing to depend on but slow dribbling payments from patients
25758: who must not be offended—for the handsome fees he had had from Freshitt
25759: Hall and Lowick Manor had been easily absorbed—nothing less than a
25760: thousand pounds would have freed him from actual embarrassment, and
25761: left a residue which, according to the favorite phrase of hopefulness
25762: in such circumstances, would have given him “time to look about him.”
25763: 
25764: Naturally, the merry Christmas bringing the happy New Year, when
25765: fellow-citizens expect to be paid for the trouble and goods they have
25766: smilingly bestowed on their neighbors, had so tightened the pressure of
25767: sordid cares on Lydgate’s mind that it was hardly possible for him to
25768: think unbrokenly of any other subject, even the most habitual and
25769: soliciting. He was not an ill-tempered man; his intellectual activity,
25770: the ardent kindness of his heart, as well as his strong frame, would
25771: always, under tolerably easy conditions, have kept him above the petty
25772: uncontrolled susceptibilities which make bad temper. But he was now a
25773: prey to that worst irritation which arises not simply from annoyances,
25774: but from the second consciousness underlying those annoyances, of
25775: wasted energy and a degrading preoccupation, which was the reverse of
25776: all his former purposes. “_This_ is what I am thinking of; and _that_
25777: is what I might have been thinking of,” was the bitter incessant murmur
25778: within him, making every difficulty a double goad to impatience.
25779: 
25780: Some gentlemen have made an amazing figure in literature by general
25781: discontent with the universe as a trap of dulness into which their
25782: great souls have fallen by mistake; but the sense of a stupendous self
25783: and an insignificant world may have its consolations. Lydgate’s
25784: discontent was much harder to bear: it was the sense that there was a
25785: grand existence in thought and effective action lying around him, while
25786: his self was being narrowed into the miserable isolation of egoistic
25787: fears, and vulgar anxieties for events that might allay such fears. His
25788: troubles will perhaps appear miserably sordid, and beneath the
25789: attention of lofty persons who can know nothing of debt except on a
25790: magnificent scale. Doubtless they were sordid; and for the majority,
25791: who are not lofty, there is no escape from sordidness but by being free
25792: from money-craving, with all its base hopes and temptations, its
25793: watching for death, its hinted requests, its horse-dealer’s desire to
25794: make bad work pass for good, its seeking for function which ought to be
25795: another’s, its compulsion often to long for Luck in the shape of a wide
25796: calamity.
25797: 
25798: It was because Lydgate writhed under the idea of getting his neck
25799: beneath this vile yoke that he had fallen into a bitter moody state
25800: which was continually widening Rosamond’s alienation from him. After
25801: the first disclosure about the bill of sale, he had made many efforts
25802: to draw her into sympathy with him about possible measures for
25803: narrowing their expenses, and with the threatening approach of
25804: Christmas his propositions grew more and more definite. “We two can do
25805: with only one servant, and live on very little,” he said, “and I shall
25806: manage with one horse.” For Lydgate, as we have seen, had begun to
25807: reason, with a more distinct vision, about the expenses of living, and
25808: any share of pride he had given to appearances of that sort was meagre
25809: compared with the pride which made him revolt from exposure as a
25810: debtor, or from asking men to help him with their money.
25811: 
25812: “Of course you can dismiss the other two servants, if you like,” said
25813: Rosamond; “but I should have thought it would be very injurious to your
25814: position for us to live in a poor way. You must expect your practice to
25815: be lowered.”
25816: 
25817: “My dear Rosamond, it is not a question of choice. We have begun too
25818: expensively. Peacock, you know, lived in a much smaller house than
25819: this. It is my fault: I ought to have known better, and I deserve a
25820: thrashing—if there were anybody who had a right to give it me—for
25821: bringing you into the necessity of living in a poorer way than you have
25822: been used to. But we married because we loved each other, I suppose.
25823: And that may help us to pull along till things get better. Come, dear,
25824: put down that work and come to me.”
25825: 
25826: He was really in chill gloom about her at that moment, but he dreaded a
25827: future without affection, and was determined to resist the oncoming of
25828: division between them. Rosamond obeyed him, and he took her on his
25829: knee, but in her secret soul she was utterly aloof from him. The poor
25830: thing saw only that the world was not ordered to her liking, and
25831: Lydgate was part of that world. But he held her waist with one hand and
25832: laid the other gently on both of hers; for this rather abrupt man had
25833: much tenderness in his manners towards women, seeming to have always
25834: present in his imagination the weakness of their frames and the
25835: delicate poise of their health both in body and mind. And he began
25836: again to speak persuasively.
25837: 
25838: “I find, now I look into things a little, Rosy, that it is wonderful
25839: what an amount of money slips away in our housekeeping. I suppose the
25840: servants are careless, and we have had a great many people coming. But
25841: there must be many in our rank who manage with much less: they must do
25842: with commoner things, I suppose, and look after the scraps. It seems,
25843: money goes but a little way in these matters, for Wrench has everything
25844: as plain as possible, and he has a very large practice.”
25845: 
25846: “Oh, if you think of living as the Wrenches do!” said Rosamond, with a
25847: little turn of her neck. “But I have heard you express your disgust at
25848: that way of living.”
25849: 
25850: “Yes, they have bad taste in everything—they make economy look ugly. We
25851: needn’t do that. I only meant that they avoid expenses, although Wrench
25852: has a capital practice.”
25853: 
25854: “Why should not you have a good practice, Tertius? Mr. Peacock had. You
25855: should be more careful not to offend people, and you should send out
25856: medicines as the others do. I am sure you began well, and you got
25857: several good houses. It cannot answer to be eccentric; you should think
25858: what will be generally liked,” said Rosamond, in a decided little tone
25859: of admonition.
25860: 
25861: Lydgate’s anger rose: he was prepared to be indulgent towards feminine
25862: weakness, but not towards feminine dictation. The shallowness of a
25863: waternixie’s soul may have a charm until she becomes didactic. But he
25864: controlled himself, and only said, with a touch of despotic firmness—
25865: 
25866: “What I am to do in my practice, Rosy, it is for me to judge. That is
25867: not the question between us. It is enough for you to know that our
25868: income is likely to be a very narrow one—hardly four hundred, perhaps
25869: less, for a long time to come, and we must try to re-arrange our lives
25870: in accordance with that fact.”
25871: 
25872: Rosamond was silent for a moment or two, looking before her, and then
25873: said, “My uncle Bulstrode ought to allow you a salary for the time you
25874: give to the Hospital: it is not right that you should work for
25875: nothing.”
25876: 
25877: “It was understood from the beginning that my services would be
25878: gratuitous. That, again, need not enter into our discussion. I have
25879: pointed out what is the only probability,” said Lydgate, impatiently.
25880: Then checking himself, he went on more quietly—
25881: 
25882: “I think I see one resource which would free us from a good deal of the
25883: present difficulty. I hear that young Ned Plymdale is going to be
25884: married to Miss Sophy Toller. They are rich, and it is not often that a
25885: good house is vacant in Middlemarch. I feel sure that they would be
25886: glad to take this house from us with most of our furniture, and they
25887: would be willing to pay handsomely for the lease. I can employ Trumbull
25888: to speak to Plymdale about it.”
25889: 
25890: Rosamond left her husband’s knee and walked slowly to the other end of
25891: the room; when she turned round and walked towards him it was evident
25892: that the tears had come, and that she was biting her under-lip and
25893: clasping her hands to keep herself from crying. Lydgate was
25894: wretched—shaken with anger and yet feeling that it would be unmanly to
25895: vent the anger just now.
25896: 
25897: “I am very sorry, Rosamond; I know this is painful.”
25898: 
25899: “I thought, at least, when I had borne to send the plate back and have
25900: that man taking an inventory of the furniture—I should have thought
25901: _that_ would suffice.”
25902: 
25903: “I explained it to you at the time, dear. That was only a security and
25904: behind that security there is a debt. And that debt must be paid within
25905: the next few months, else we shall have our furniture sold. If young
25906: Plymdale will take our house and most of our furniture, we shall be
25907: able to pay that debt, and some others too, and we shall be quit of a
25908: place too expensive for us. We might take a smaller house: Trumbull, I
25909: know, has a very decent one to let at thirty pounds a-year, and this is
25910: ninety.” Lydgate uttered this speech in the curt hammering way with
25911: which we usually try to nail down a vague mind to imperative facts.
25912: Tears rolled silently down Rosamond’s cheeks; she just pressed her
25913: handkerchief against them, and stood looking at the large vase on the
25914: mantel-piece. It was a moment of more intense bitterness than she had
25915: ever felt before. At last she said, without hurry and with careful
25916: emphasis—
25917: 
25918: “I never could have believed that you would like to act in that way.”
25919: 
25920: “Like it?” burst out Lydgate, rising from his chair, thrusting his
25921: hands in his pockets and stalking away from the hearth; “it’s not a
25922: question of liking. Of course, I don’t like it; it’s the only thing I
25923: can do.” He wheeled round there, and turned towards her.
25924: 
25925: “I should have thought there were many other means than that,” said
25926: Rosamond. “Let us have a sale and leave Middlemarch altogether.”
25927: 
25928: “To do what? What is the use of my leaving my work in Middlemarch to go
25929: where I have none? We should be just as penniless elsewhere as we are
25930: here,” said Lydgate still more angrily.
25931: 
25932: “If we are to be in that position it will be entirely your own doing,
25933: Tertius,” said Rosamond, turning round to speak with the fullest
25934: conviction. “You will not behave as you ought to do to your own family.
25935: You offended Captain Lydgate. Sir Godwin was very kind to me when we
25936: were at Quallingham, and I am sure if you showed proper regard to him
25937: and told him your affairs, he would do anything for you. But rather
25938: than that, you like giving up our house and furniture to Mr. Ned
25939: Plymdale.”
25940: 
25941: There was something like fierceness in Lydgate’s eyes, as he answered
25942: with new violence, “Well, then, if you will have it so, I do like it. I
25943: admit that I like it better than making a fool of myself by going to
25944: beg where it’s of no use. Understand then, that it is what I _like to
25945: do._”
25946: 
25947: There was a tone in the last sentence which was equivalent to the
25948: clutch of his strong hand on Rosamond’s delicate arm. But for all that,
25949: his will was not a whit stronger than hers. She immediately walked out
25950: of the room in silence, but with an intense determination to hinder
25951: what Lydgate liked to do.
25952: 
25953: He went out of the house, but as his blood cooled he felt that the
25954: chief result of the discussion was a deposit of dread within him at the
25955: idea of opening with his wife in future subjects which might again urge
25956: him to violent speech. It was as if a fracture in delicate crystal had
25957: begun, and he was afraid of any movement that might make it fatal. His
25958: marriage would be a mere piece of bitter irony if they could not go on
25959: loving each other. He had long ago made up his mind to what he thought
25960: was her negative character—her want of sensibility, which showed itself
25961: in disregard both of his specific wishes and of his general aims. The
25962: first great disappointment had been borne: the tender devotedness and
25963: docile adoration of the ideal wife must be renounced, and life must be
25964: taken up on a lower stage of expectation, as it is by men who have lost
25965: their limbs. But the real wife had not only her claims, she had still a
25966: hold on his heart, and it was his intense desire that the hold should
25967: remain strong. In marriage, the certainty, “She will never love me
25968: much,” is easier to bear than the fear, “I shall love her no more.”
25969: Hence, after that outburst, his inward effort was entirely to excuse
25970: her, and to blame the hard circumstances which were partly his fault.
25971: He tried that evening, by petting her, to heal the wound he had made in
25972: the morning, and it was not in Rosamond’s nature to be repellent or
25973: sulky; indeed, she welcomed the signs that her husband loved her and
25974: was under control. But this was something quite distinct from loving
25975: _him_. Lydgate would not have chosen soon to recur to the plan of
25976: parting with the house; he was resolved to carry it out, and say as
25977: little more about it as possible. But Rosamond herself touched on it at
25978: breakfast by saying, mildly—
25979: 
25980: “Have you spoken to Trumbull yet?”
25981: 
25982: “No,” said Lydgate, “but I shall call on him as I go by this morning.
25983: No time must be lost.” He took Rosamond’s question as a sign that she
25984: withdrew her inward opposition, and kissed her head caressingly when he
25985: got up to go away.
25986: 
25987: As soon as it was late enough to make a call, Rosamond went to Mrs.
25988: Plymdale, Mr. Ned’s mother, and entered with pretty congratulations
25989: into the subject of the coming marriage. Mrs. Plymdale’s maternal view
25990: was, that Rosamond might possibly now have retrospective glimpses of
25991: her own folly; and feeling the advantages to be at present all on the
25992: side of her son, was too kind a woman not to behave graciously.
25993: 
25994: “Yes, Ned is most happy, I must say. And Sophy Toller is all I could
25995: desire in a daughter-in-law. Of course her father is able to do
25996: something handsome for her—that is only what would be expected with a
25997: brewery like his. And the connection is everything we should desire.
25998: But that is not what I look at. She is such a very nice girl—no airs,
25999: no pretensions, though on a level with the first. I don’t mean with the
26000: titled aristocracy. I see very little good in people aiming out of
26001: their own sphere. I mean that Sophy is equal to the best in the town,
26002: and she is contented with that.”
26003: 
26004: “I have always thought her very agreeable,” said Rosamond.
26005: 
26006: “I look upon it as a reward for Ned, who never held his head too high,
26007: that he should have got into the very best connection,” continued Mrs.
26008: Plymdale, her native sharpness softened by a fervid sense that she was
26009: taking a correct view. “And such particular people as the Tollers are,
26010: they might have objected because some of our friends are not theirs. It
26011: is well known that your aunt Bulstrode and I have been intimate from
26012: our youth, and Mr. Plymdale has been always on Mr. Bulstrode’s side.
26013: And I myself prefer serious opinions. But the Tollers have welcomed Ned
26014: all the same.”
26015: 
26016: “I am sure he is a very deserving, well-principled young man,” said
26017: Rosamond, with a neat air of patronage in return for Mrs. Plymdale’s
26018: wholesome corrections.
26019: 
26020: “Oh, he has not the style of a captain in the army, or that sort of
26021: carriage as if everybody was beneath him, or that showy kind of
26022: talking, and singing, and intellectual talent. But I am thankful he has
26023: not. It is a poor preparation both for here and Hereafter.”
26024: 
26025: “Oh dear, yes; appearances have very little to do with happiness,” said
26026: Rosamond. “I think there is every prospect of their being a happy
26027: couple. What house will they take?”
26028: 
26029: “Oh, as for that, they must put up with what they can get. They have
26030: been looking at the house in St. Peter’s Place, next to Mr. Hackbutt’s;
26031: it belongs to him, and he is putting it nicely in repair. I suppose
26032: they are not likely to hear of a better. Indeed, I think Ned will
26033: decide the matter to-day.”
26034: 
26035: “I should think it is a nice house; I like St. Peter’s Place.”
26036: 
26037: “Well, it is near the Church, and a genteel situation. But the windows
26038: are narrow, and it is all ups and downs. You don’t happen to know of
26039: any other that would be at liberty?” said Mrs. Plymdale, fixing her
26040: round black eyes on Rosamond with the animation of a sudden thought in
26041: them.
26042: 
26043: “Oh no; I hear so little of those things.”
26044: 
26045: Rosamond had not foreseen that question and answer in setting out to
26046: pay her visit; she had simply meant to gather any information which
26047: would help her to avert the parting with her own house under
26048: circumstances thoroughly disagreeable to her. As to the untruth in her
26049: reply, she no more reflected on it than she did on the untruth there
26050: was in her saying that appearances had very little to do with
26051: happiness. Her object, she was convinced, was thoroughly justifiable:
26052: it was Lydgate whose intention was inexcusable; and there was a plan in
26053: her mind which, when she had carried it out fully, would prove how very
26054: false a step it would have been for him to have descended from his
26055: position.
26056: 
26057: She returned home by Mr. Borthrop Trumbull’s office, meaning to call
26058: there. It was the first time in her life that Rosamond had thought of
26059: doing anything in the form of business, but she felt equal to the
26060: occasion. That she should be obliged to do what she intensely disliked,
26061: was an idea which turned her quiet tenacity into active invention. Here
26062: was a case in which it could not be enough simply to disobey and be
26063: serenely, placidly obstinate: she must act according to her judgment,
26064: and she said to herself that her judgment was right—“indeed, if it had
26065: not been, she would not have wished to act on it.”
26066: 
26067: Mr. Trumbull was in the back-room of his office, and received Rosamond
26068: with his finest manners, not only because he had much sensibility to
26069: her charms, but because the good-natured fibre in him was stirred by
26070: his certainty that Lydgate was in difficulties, and that this
26071: uncommonly pretty woman—this young lady with the highest personal
26072: attractions—was likely to feel the pinch of trouble—to find herself
26073: involved in circumstances beyond her control. He begged her to do him
26074: the honor to take a seat, and stood before her trimming and comporting
26075: himself with an eager solicitude, which was chiefly benevolent.
26076: Rosamond’s first question was, whether her husband had called on Mr.
26077: Trumbull that morning, to speak about disposing of their house.
26078: 
26079: “Yes, ma’am, yes, he did; he did so,” said the good auctioneer, trying
26080: to throw something soothing into his iteration. “I was about to fulfil
26081: his order, if possible, this afternoon. He wished me not to
26082: procrastinate.”
26083: 
26084: “I called to tell you not to go any further, Mr. Trumbull; and I beg of
26085: you not to mention what has been said on the subject. Will you oblige
26086: me?”
26087: 
26088: “Certainly I will, Mrs. Lydgate, certainly. Confidence is sacred with
26089: me on business or any other topic. I am then to consider the commission
26090: withdrawn?” said Mr. Trumbull, adjusting the long ends of his blue
26091: cravat with both hands, and looking at Rosamond deferentially.
26092: 
26093: “Yes, if you please. I find that Mr. Ned Plymdale has taken a house—the
26094: one in St. Peter’s Place next to Mr. Hackbutt’s. Mr. Lydgate would be
26095: annoyed that his orders should be fulfilled uselessly. And besides
26096: that, there are other circumstances which render the proposal
26097: unnecessary.”
26098: 
26099: “Very good, Mrs. Lydgate, very good. I am at your commands, whenever
26100: you require any service of me,” said Mr. Trumbull, who felt pleasure in
26101: conjecturing that some new resources had been opened. “Rely on me, I
26102: beg. The affair shall go no further.”
26103: 
26104: That evening Lydgate was a little comforted by observing that Rosamond
26105: was more lively than she had usually been of late, and even seemed
26106: interested in doing what would please him without being asked. He
26107: thought, “If she will be happy and I can rub through, what does it all
26108: signify? It is only a narrow swamp that we have to pass in a long
26109: journey. If I can get my mind clear again, I shall do.”
26110: 
26111: He was so much cheered that he began to search for an account of
26112: experiments which he had long ago meant to look up, and had neglected
26113: out of that creeping self-despair which comes in the train of petty
26114: anxieties. He felt again some of the old delightful absorption in a
26115: far-reaching inquiry, while Rosamond played the quiet music which was
26116: as helpful to his meditation as the plash of an oar on the evening
26117: lake. It was rather late; he had pushed away all the books, and was
26118: looking at the fire with his hands clasped behind his head in
26119: forgetfulness of everything except the construction of a new
26120: controlling experiment, when Rosamond, who had left the piano and was
26121: leaning back in her chair watching him, said—
26122: 
26123: “Mr. Ned Plymdale has taken a house already.”
26124: 
26125: Lydgate, startled and jarred, looked up in silence for a moment, like a
26126: man who has been disturbed in his sleep. Then flushing with an
26127: unpleasant consciousness, he asked—
26128: 
26129: “How do you know?”
26130: 
26131: “I called at Mrs. Plymdale’s this morning, and she told me that he had
26132: taken the house in St. Peter’s Place, next to Mr. Hackbutt’s.”
26133: 
26134: Lydgate was silent. He drew his hands from behind his head and pressed
26135: them against the hair which was hanging, as it was apt to do, in a mass
26136: on his forehead, while he rested his elbows on his knees. He was
26137: feeling bitter disappointment, as if he had opened a door out of a
26138: suffocating place and had found it walled up; but he also felt sure
26139: that Rosamond was pleased with the cause of his disappointment. He
26140: preferred not looking at her and not speaking, until he had got over
26141: the first spasm of vexation. After all, he said in his bitterness, what
26142: can a woman care about so much as house and furniture? a husband
26143: without them is an absurdity. When he looked up and pushed his hair
26144: aside, his dark eyes had a miserable blank non-expectance of sympathy
26145: in them, but he only said, coolly—
26146: 
26147: “Perhaps some one else may turn up. I told Trumbull to be on the
26148: look-out if he failed with Plymdale.”
26149: 
26150: Rosamond made no remark. She trusted to the chance that nothing more
26151: would pass between her husband and the auctioneer until some issue
26152: should have justified her interference; at any rate, she had hindered
26153: the event which she immediately dreaded. After a pause, she said—
26154: 
26155: “How much money is it that those disagreeable people want?”
26156: 
26157: “What disagreeable people?”
26158: 
26159: “Those who took the list—and the others. I mean, how much money would
26160: satisfy them so that you need not be troubled any more?”
26161: 
26162: Lydgate surveyed her for a moment, as if he were looking for symptoms,
26163: and then said, “Oh, if I could have got six hundred from Plymdale for
26164: furniture and as premium, I might have managed. I could have paid off
26165: Dover, and given enough on account to the others to make them wait
26166: patiently, if we contracted our expenses.”
26167: 
26168: “But I mean how much should you want if we stayed in this house?”
26169: 
26170: “More than I am likely to get anywhere,” said Lydgate, with rather a
26171: grating sarcasm in his tone. It angered him to perceive that Rosamond’s
26172: mind was wandering over impracticable wishes instead of facing possible
26173: efforts.
26174: 
26175: “Why should you not mention the sum?” said Rosamond, with a mild
26176: indication that she did not like his manners.
26177: 
26178: “Well,” said Lydgate in a guessing tone, “it would take at least a
26179: thousand to set me at ease. But,” he added, incisively, “I have to
26180: consider what I shall do without it, not with it.”
26181: 
26182: Rosamond said no more.
26183: 
26184: But the next day she carried out her plan of writing to Sir Godwin
26185: Lydgate. Since the Captain’s visit, she had received a letter from him,
26186: and also one from Mrs. Mengan, his married sister, condoling with her
26187: on the loss of her baby, and expressing vaguely the hope that they
26188: should see her again at Quallingham. Lydgate had told her that this
26189: politeness meant nothing; but she was secretly convinced that any
26190: backwardness in Lydgate’s family towards him was due to his cold and
26191: contemptuous behavior, and she had answered the letters in her most
26192: charming manner, feeling some confidence that a specific invitation
26193: would follow. But there had been total silence. The Captain evidently
26194: was not a great penman, and Rosamond reflected that the sisters might
26195: have been abroad. However, the season was come for thinking of friends
26196: at home, and at any rate Sir Godwin, who had chucked her under the
26197: chin, and pronounced her to be like the celebrated beauty, Mrs. Croly,
26198: who had made a conquest of him in 1790, would be touched by any appeal
26199: from her, and would find it pleasant for her sake to behave as he ought
26200: to do towards his nephew. Rosamond was naively convinced of what an old
26201: gentleman ought to do to prevent her from suffering annoyance. And she
26202: wrote what she considered the most judicious letter possible—one which
26203: would strike Sir Godwin as a proof of her excellent sense—pointing out
26204: how desirable it was that Tertius should quit such a place as
26205: Middlemarch for one more fitted to his talents, how the unpleasant
26206: character of the inhabitants had hindered his professional success, and
26207: how in consequence he was in money difficulties, from which it would
26208: require a thousand pounds thoroughly to extricate him. She did not say
26209: that Tertius was unaware of her intention to write; for she had the
26210: idea that his supposed sanction of her letter would be in accordance
26211: with what she did say of his great regard for his uncle Godwin as the
26212: relative who had always been his best friend. Such was the force of
26213: Poor Rosamond’s tactics now she applied them to affairs.
26214: 
26215: This had happened before the party on New Year’s Day, and no answer had
26216: yet come from Sir Godwin. But on the morning of that day Lydgate had to
26217: learn that Rosamond had revoked his order to Borthrop Trumbull. Feeling
26218: it necessary that she should be gradually accustomed to the idea of
26219: their quitting the house in Lowick Gate, he overcame his reluctance to
26220: speak to her again on the subject, and when they were breakfasting
26221: said—
26222: 
26223: “I shall try to see Trumbull this morning, and tell him to advertise
26224: the house in the ‘Pioneer’ and the ‘Trumpet.’ If the thing were
26225: advertised, some one might be inclined to take it who would not
26226: otherwise have thought of a change. In these country places many people
26227: go on in their old houses when their families are too large for them,
26228: for want of knowing where they can find another. And Trumbull seems to
26229: have got no bite at all.”
26230: 
26231: Rosamond knew that the inevitable moment was come. “I ordered Trumbull
26232: not to inquire further,” she said, with a careful calmness which was
26233: evidently defensive.
26234: 
26235: Lydgate stared at her in mute amazement. Only half an hour before he
26236: had been fastening up her plaits for her, and talking the “little
26237: language” of affection, which Rosamond, though not returning it,
26238: accepted as if she had been a serene and lovely image, now and then
26239: miraculously dimpling towards her votary. With such fibres still astir
26240: in him, the shock he received could not at once be distinctly anger; it
26241: was confused pain. He laid down the knife and fork with which he was
26242: carving, and throwing himself back in his chair, said at last, with a
26243: cool irony in his tone—
26244: 
26245: “May I ask when and why you did so?”
26246: 
26247: “When I knew that the Plymdales had taken a house, I called to tell him
26248: not to mention ours to them; and at the same time I told him not to let
26249: the affair go on any further. I knew that it would be very injurious to
26250: you if it were known that you wished to part with your house and
26251: furniture, and I had a very strong objection to it. I think that was
26252: reason enough.”
26253: 
26254: “It was of no consequence then that I had told you imperative reasons
26255: of another kind; of no consequence that I had come to a different
26256: conclusion, and given an order accordingly?” said Lydgate, bitingly,
26257: the thunder and lightning gathering about his brow and eyes.
26258: 
26259: The effect of any one’s anger on Rosamond had always been to make her
26260: shrink in cold dislike, and to become all the more calmly correct, in
26261: the conviction that she was not the person to misbehave whatever others
26262: might do. She replied—
26263: 
26264: “I think I had a perfect right to speak on a subject which concerns me
26265: at least as much as you.”
26266: 
26267: “Clearly—you had a right to speak, but only to me. You had no right to
26268: contradict my orders secretly, and treat me as if I were a fool,” said
26269: Lydgate, in the same tone as before. Then with some added scorn, “Is it
26270: possible to make you understand what the consequences will be? Is it of
26271: any use for me to tell you again why we must try to part with the
26272: house?”
26273: 
26274: “It is not necessary for you to tell me again,” said Rosamond, in a
26275: voice that fell and trickled like cold water-drops. “I remembered what
26276: you said. You spoke just as violently as you do now. But that does not
26277: alter my opinion that you ought to try every other means rather than
26278: take a step which is so painful to me. And as to advertising the house,
26279: I think it would be perfectly degrading to you.”
26280: 
26281: “And suppose I disregard your opinion as you disregard mine?”
26282: 
26283: “You can do so, of course. But I think you ought to have told me before
26284: we were married that you would place me in the worst position, rather
26285: than give up your own will.”
26286: 
26287: Lydgate did not speak, but tossed his head on one side, and twitched
26288: the corners of his mouth in despair. Rosamond, seeing that he was not
26289: looking at her, rose and set his cup of coffee before him; but he took
26290: no notice of it, and went on with an inward drama and argument,
26291: occasionally moving in his seat, resting one arm on the table, and
26292: rubbing his hand against his hair. There was a conflux of emotions and
26293: thoughts in him that would not let him either give thorough way to his
26294: anger or persevere with simple rigidity of resolve. Rosamond took
26295: advantage of his silence.
26296: 
26297: “When we were married everyone felt that your position was very high. I
26298: could not have imagined then that you would want to sell our furniture,
26299: and take a house in Bride Street, where the rooms are like cages. If we
26300: are to live in that way let us at least leave Middlemarch.”
26301: 
26302: “These would be very strong considerations,” said Lydgate, half
26303: ironically—still there was a withered paleness about his lips as he
26304: looked at his coffee, and did not drink—“these would be very strong
26305: considerations if I did not happen to be in debt.”
26306: 
26307: “Many persons must have been in debt in the same way, but if they are
26308: respectable, people trust them. I am sure I have heard papa say that
26309: the Torbits were in debt, and they went on very well. It cannot be good
26310: to act rashly,” said Rosamond, with serene wisdom.
26311: 
26312: Lydgate sat paralyzed by opposing impulses: since no reasoning he could
26313: apply to Rosamond seemed likely to conquer her assent, he wanted to
26314: smash and grind some object on which he could at least produce an
26315: impression, or else to tell her brutally that he was master, and she
26316: must obey. But he not only dreaded the effect of such extremities on
26317: their mutual life—he had a growing dread of Rosamond’s quiet elusive
26318: obstinacy, which would not allow any assertion of power to be final;
26319: and again, she had touched him in a spot of keenest feeling by implying
26320: that she had been deluded with a false vision of happiness in marrying
26321: him. As to saying that he was master, it was not the fact. The very
26322: resolution to which he had wrought himself by dint of logic and
26323: honorable pride was beginning to relax under her torpedo contact. He
26324: swallowed half his cup of coffee, and then rose to go.
26325: 
26326: “I may at least request that you will not go to Trumbull at
26327: present—until it has been seen that there are no other means,” said
26328: Rosamond. Although she was not subject to much fear, she felt it safer
26329: not to betray that she had written to Sir Godwin. “Promise me that you
26330: will not go to him for a few weeks, or without telling me.”
26331: 
26332: Lydgate gave a short laugh. “I think it is I who should exact a promise
26333: that you will do nothing without telling me,” he said, turning his eyes
26334: sharply upon her, and then moving to the door.
26335: 
26336: “You remember that we are going to dine at papa’s,” said Rosamond,
26337: wishing that he should turn and make a more thorough concession to her.
26338: But he only said “Oh yes,” impatiently, and went away. She held it to
26339: be very odious in him that he did not think the painful propositions he
26340: had had to make to her were enough, without showing so unpleasant a
26341: temper. And when she put the moderate request that he would defer going
26342: to Trumbull again, it was cruel in him not to assure her of what he
26343: meant to do. She was convinced of her having acted in every way for the
26344: best; and each grating or angry speech of Lydgate’s served only as an
26345: addition to the register of offences in her mind. Poor Rosamond for
26346: months had begun to associate her husband with feelings of
26347: disappointment, and the terribly inflexible relation of marriage had
26348: lost its charm of encouraging delightful dreams. It had freed her from
26349: the disagreeables of her father’s house, but it had not given her
26350: everything that she had wished and hoped. The Lydgate with whom she had
26351: been in love had been a group of airy conditions for her, most of which
26352: had disappeared, while their place had been taken by every-day details
26353: which must be lived through slowly from hour to hour, not floated
26354: through with a rapid selection of favorable aspects. The habits of
26355: Lydgate’s profession, his home preoccupation with scientific subjects,
26356: which seemed to her almost like a morbid vampire’s taste, his peculiar
26357: views of things which had never entered into the dialogue of
26358: courtship—all these continually alienating influences, even without the
26359: fact of his having placed himself at a disadvantage in the town, and
26360: without that first shock of revelation about Dover’s debt, would have
26361: made his presence dull to her. There was another presence which ever
26362: since the early days of her marriage, until four months ago, had been
26363: an agreeable excitement, but that was gone: Rosamond would not confess
26364: to herself how much the consequent blank had to do with her utter
26365: ennui; and it seemed to her (perhaps she was right) that an invitation
26366: to Quallingham, and an opening for Lydgate to settle elsewhere than in
26367: Middlemarch—in London, or somewhere likely to be free from
26368: unpleasantness—would satisfy her quite well, and make her indifferent
26369: to the absence of Will Ladislaw, towards whom she felt some resentment
26370: for his exaltation of Mrs. Casaubon.
26371: 
26372: That was the state of things with Lydgate and Rosamond on the New
26373: Year’s Day when they dined at her father’s, she looking mildly neutral
26374: towards him in remembrance of his ill-tempered behavior at breakfast,
26375: and he carrying a much deeper effect from the inward conflict in which
26376: that morning scene was only one of many epochs. His flushed effort
26377: while talking to Mr. Farebrother—his effort after the cynical pretence
26378: that all ways of getting money are essentially the same, and that
26379: chance has an empire which reduces choice to a fool’s illusion—was but
26380: the symptom of a wavering resolve, a benumbed response to the old
26381: stimuli of enthusiasm.
26382: 
26383: What was he to do? He saw even more keenly than Rosamond did the
26384: dreariness of taking her into the small house in Bride Street, where
26385: she would have scanty furniture around her and discontent within: a
26386: life of privation and life with Rosamond were two images which had
26387: become more and more irreconcilable ever since the threat of privation
26388: had disclosed itself. But even if his resolves had forced the two
26389: images into combination, the useful preliminaries to that hard change
26390: were not visibly within reach. And though he had not given the promise
26391: which his wife had asked for, he did not go again to Trumbull. He even
26392: began to think of taking a rapid journey to the North and seeing Sir
26393: Godwin. He had once believed that nothing would urge him into making an
26394: application for money to his uncle, but he had not then known the full
26395: pressure of alternatives yet more disagreeable. He could not depend on
26396: the effect of a letter; it was only in an interview, however
26397: disagreeable this might be to himself, that he could give a thorough
26398: explanation and could test the effectiveness of kinship. No sooner had
26399: Lydgate begun to represent this step to himself as the easiest than
26400: there was a reaction of anger that he—he who had long ago determined to
26401: live aloof from such abject calculations, such self-interested anxiety
26402: about the inclinations and the pockets of men with whom he had been
26403: proud to have no aims in common—should have fallen not simply to their
26404: level, but to the level of soliciting them.

26415: 
26416: 
26417: The bias of human nature to be slow in correspondence triumphs even
26418: over the present quickening in the general pace of things: what wonder
26419: then that in 1832 old Sir Godwin Lydgate was slow to write a letter
26420: which was of consequence to others rather than to himself? Nearly three
26421: weeks of the new year were gone, and Rosamond, awaiting an answer to
26422: her winning appeal, was every day disappointed. Lydgate, in total
26423: ignorance of her expectations, was seeing the bills come in, and
26424: feeling that Dover’s use of his advantage over other creditors was
26425: imminent. He had never mentioned to Rosamond his brooding purpose of
26426: going to Quallingham: he did not want to admit what would appear to her
26427: a concession to her wishes after indignant refusal, until the last
26428: moment; but he was really expecting to set off soon. A slice of the
26429: railway would enable him to manage the whole journey and back in four
26430: days.
26431: 
26432: But one morning after Lydgate had gone out, a letter came addressed to
26433: him, which Rosamond saw clearly to be from Sir Godwin. She was full of
26434: hope. Perhaps there might be a particular note to her enclosed; but
26435: Lydgate was naturally addressed on the question of money or other aid,
26436: and the fact that he was written to, nay, the very delay in writing at
26437: all, seemed to certify that the answer was thoroughly compliant. She
26438: was too much excited by these thoughts to do anything but light
26439: stitching in a warm corner of the dining-room, with the outside of this
26440: momentous letter lying on the table before her. About twelve she heard
26441: her husband’s step in the passage, and tripping to open the door, she
26442: said in her lightest tones, “Tertius, come in here—here is a letter for
26443: you.”
26444: 
26445: “Ah?” he said, not taking off his hat, but just turning her round
26446: within his arm to walk towards the spot where the letter lay. “My uncle
26447: Godwin!” he exclaimed, while Rosamond reseated herself, and watched him
26448: as he opened the letter. She had expected him to be surprised.
26449: 
26450: While Lydgate’s eyes glanced rapidly over the brief letter, she saw his
26451: face, usually of a pale brown, taking on a dry whiteness; with nostrils
26452: and lips quivering he tossed down the letter before her, and said
26453: violently—
26454: 
26455: “It will be impossible to endure life with you, if you will always be
26456: acting secretly—acting in opposition to me and hiding your actions.”
26457: 
26458: He checked his speech and turned his back on her—then wheeled round and
26459: walked about, sat down, and got up again restlessly, grasping hard the
26460: objects deep down in his pockets. He was afraid of saying something
26461: irremediably cruel.
26462: 
26463: Rosamond too had changed color as she read. The letter ran in this
26464: way:—
26465: 
26466: “DEAR TERTIUS,—Don’t set your wife to write to me when you have
26467: anything to ask. It is a roundabout wheedling sort of thing which I
26468: should not have credited you with. I never choose to write to a woman
26469: on matters of business. As to my supplying you with a thousand pounds,
26470: or only half that sum, I can do nothing of the sort. My own family
26471: drains me to the last penny. With two younger sons and three daughters,
26472: I am not likely to have cash to spare. You seem to have got through
26473: your own money pretty quickly, and to have made a mess where you are;
26474: the sooner you go somewhere else the better. But I have nothing to do
26475: with men of your profession, and can’t help you there. I did the best I
26476: could for you as guardian, and let you have your own way in taking to
26477: medicine. You might have gone into the army or the Church. Your money
26478: would have held out for that, and there would have been a surer ladder
26479: before you. Your uncle Charles has had a grudge against you for not
26480: going into his profession, but not I. I have always wished you well,
26481: but you must consider yourself on your own legs entirely now.
26482: 
26483: 
26484: Your affectionate uncle,
26485: GODWIN LYDGATE.”
26486: 
26487: 
26488: When Rosamond had finished reading the letter she sat quite still, with
26489: her hands folded before her, restraining any show of her keen
26490: disappointment, and intrenching herself in quiet passivity under her
26491: husband’s wrath. Lydgate paused in his movements, looked at her again,
26492: and said, with biting severity—
26493: 
26494: “Will this be enough to convince you of the harm you may do by secret
26495: meddling? Have you sense enough to recognize now your incompetence to
26496: judge and act for me—to interfere with your ignorance in affairs which
26497: it belongs to me to decide on?”
26498: 
26499: The words were hard; but this was not the first time that Lydgate had
26500: been frustrated by her. She did not look at him, and made no reply.
26501: 
26502: “I had nearly resolved on going to Quallingham. It would have cost me
26503: pain enough to do it, yet it might have been of some use. But it has
26504: been of no use for me to think of anything. You have always been
26505: counteracting me secretly. You delude me with a false assent, and then
26506: I am at the mercy of your devices. If you mean to resist every wish I
26507: express, say so and defy me. I shall at least know what I am doing
26508: then.”
26509: 
26510: It is a terrible moment in young lives when the closeness of love’s
26511: bond has turned to this power of galling. In spite of Rosamond’s
26512: self-control a tear fell silently and rolled over her lips. She still
26513: said nothing; but under that quietude was hidden an intense effect: she
26514: was in such entire disgust with her husband that she wished she had
26515: never seen him. Sir Godwin’s rudeness towards her and utter want of
26516: feeling ranged him with Dover and all other creditors—disagreeable
26517: people who only thought of themselves, and did not mind how annoying
26518: they were to her. Even her father was unkind, and might have done more
26519: for them. In fact there was but one person in Rosamond’s world whom she
26520: did not regard as blameworthy, and that was the graceful creature with
26521: blond plaits and with little hands crossed before her, who had never
26522: expressed herself unbecomingly, and had always acted for the best—the
26523: best naturally being what she best liked.
26524: 
26525: Lydgate pausing and looking at her began to feel that half-maddening
26526: sense of helplessness which comes over passionate people when their
26527: passion is met by an innocent-looking silence whose meek victimized air
26528: seems to put them in the wrong, and at last infects even the justest
26529: indignation with a doubt of its justice. He needed to recover the full
26530: sense that he was in the right by moderating his words.
26531: 
26532: “Can you not see, Rosamond,” he began again, trying to be simply grave
26533: and not bitter, “that nothing can be so fatal as a want of openness and
26534: confidence between us? It has happened again and again that I have
26535: expressed a decided wish, and you have seemed to assent, yet after that
26536: you have secretly disobeyed my wish. In that way I can never know what
26537: I have to trust to. There would be some hope for us if you would admit
26538: this. Am I such an unreasonable, furious brute? Why should you not be
26539: open with me?” Still silence.
26540: 
26541: “Will you only say that you have been mistaken, and that I may depend
26542: on your not acting secretly in future?” said Lydgate, urgently, but
26543: with something of request in his tone which Rosamond was quick to
26544: perceive. She spoke with coolness.
26545: 
26546: “I cannot possibly make admissions or promises in answer to such words
26547: as you have used towards me. I have not been accustomed to language of
26548: that kind. You have spoken of my ‘secret meddling,’ and my ‘interfering
26549: ignorance,’ and my ‘false assent.’ I have never expressed myself in
26550: that way to you, and I think that you ought to apologize. You spoke of
26551: its being impossible to live with me. Certainly you have not made my
26552: life pleasant to me of late. I think it was to be expected that I
26553: should try to avert some of the hardships which our marriage has
26554: brought on me.” Another tear fell as Rosamond ceased speaking, and she
26555: pressed it away as quietly as the first.
26556: 
26557: Lydgate flung himself into a chair, feeling checkmated. What place was
26558: there in her mind for a remonstrance to lodge in? He laid down his hat,
26559: flung an arm over the back of his chair, and looked down for some
26560: moments without speaking. Rosamond had the double purchase over him of
26561: insensibility to the point of justice in his reproach, and of
26562: sensibility to the undeniable hardships now present in her married
26563: life. Although her duplicity in the affair of the house had exceeded
26564: what he knew, and had really hindered the Plymdales from knowing of it,
26565: she had no consciousness that her action could rightly be called false.
26566: We are not obliged to identify our own acts according to a strict
26567: classification, any more than the materials of our grocery and clothes.
26568: Rosamond felt that she was aggrieved, and that this was what Lydgate
26569: had to recognize.
26570: 
26571: As for him, the need of accommodating himself to her nature, which was
26572: inflexible in proportion to its negations, held him as with pincers. He
26573: had begun to have an alarmed foresight of her irrevocable loss of love
26574: for him, and the consequent dreariness of their life. The ready fulness
26575: of his emotions made this dread alternate quickly with the first
26576: violent movements of his anger. It would assuredly have been a vain
26577: boast in him to say that he was her master.
26578: 
26579: “You have not made my life pleasant to me of late”—“the hardships which
26580: our marriage has brought on me”—these words were stinging his
26581: imagination as a pain makes an exaggerated dream. If he were not only
26582: to sink from his highest resolve, but to sink into the hideous
26583: fettering of domestic hate?
26584: 
26585: “Rosamond,” he said, turning his eyes on her with a melancholy look,
26586: “you should allow for a man’s words when he is disappointed and
26587: provoked. You and I cannot have opposite interests. I cannot part my
26588: happiness from yours. If I am angry with you, it is that you seem not
26589: to see how any concealment divides us. How could I wish to make
26590: anything hard to you either by my words or conduct? When I hurt you, I
26591: hurt part of my own life. I should never be angry with you if you would
26592: be quite open with me.”
26593: 
26594: “I have only wished to prevent you from hurrying us into wretchedness
26595: without any necessity,” said Rosamond, the tears coming again from a
26596: softened feeling now that her husband had softened. “It is so very hard
26597: to be disgraced here among all the people we know, and to live in such
26598: a miserable way. I wish I had died with the baby.”
26599: 
26600: She spoke and wept with that gentleness which makes such words and
26601: tears omnipotent over a loving-hearted man. Lydgate drew his chair near
26602: to hers and pressed her delicate head against his cheek with his
26603: powerful tender hand. He only caressed her; he did not say anything;
26604: for what was there to say? He could not promise to shield her from the
26605: dreaded wretchedness, for he could see no sure means of doing so. When
26606: he left her to go out again, he told himself that it was ten times
26607: harder for her than for him: he had a life away from home, and constant
26608: appeals to his activity on behalf of others. He wished to excuse
26609: everything in her if he could—but it was inevitable that in that
26610: excusing mood he should think of her as if she were an animal of
26611: another and feebler species. Nevertheless she had mastered him.
26612: 
26613: 
26614: 
26615: 
26616: CHAPTER LXVI.
26617: 
26618: ’Tis one thing to be tempted, Escalus,
26619: Another thing to fall.
26620: —_Measure for Measure_.
26621: 
26622: 
26623: Lydgate certainly had good reason to reflect on the service his
26624: practice did him in counteracting his personal cares. He had no longer
26625: free energy enough for spontaneous research and speculative thinking,
26626: but by the bedside of patients, the direct external calls on his
26627: judgment and sympathies brought the added impulse needed to draw him
26628: out of himself. It was not simply that beneficent harness of routine
26629: which enables silly men to live respectably and unhappy men to live
26630: calmly—it was a perpetual claim on the immediate fresh application of
26631: thought, and on the consideration of another’s need and trial. Many of
26632: us looking back through life would say that the kindest man we have
26633: ever known has been a medical man, or perhaps that surgeon whose fine
26634: tact, directed by deeply informed perception, has come to us in our
26635: need with a more sublime beneficence than that of miracle-workers. Some
26636: of that twice-blessed mercy was always with Lydgate in his work at the
26637: Hospital or in private houses, serving better than any opiate to quiet
26638: and sustain him under his anxieties and his sense of mental degeneracy.
26639: 
26640: Mr. Farebrother’s suspicion as to the opiate was true, however. Under
26641: the first galling pressure of foreseen difficulties, and the first
26642: perception that his marriage, if it were not to be a yoked loneliness,
26643: must be a state of effort to go on loving without too much care about
26644: being loved, he had once or twice tried a dose of opium. But he had no
26645: hereditary constitutional craving after such transient escapes from the
26646: hauntings of misery. He was strong, could drink a great deal of wine,
26647: but did not care about it; and when the men round him were drinking
26648: spirits, he took sugar and water, having a contemptuous pity even for
26649: the earliest stages of excitement from drink. It was the same with
26650: gambling. He had looked on at a great deal of gambling in Paris,
26651: watching it as if it had been a disease. He was no more tempted by such
26652: winning than he was by drink. He had said to himself that the only
26653: winning he cared for must be attained by a conscious process of high,
26654: difficult combination tending towards a beneficent result. The power he
26655: longed for could not be represented by agitated fingers clutching a
26656: heap of coin, or by the half-barbarous, half-idiotic triumph in the
26657: eyes of a man who sweeps within his arms the ventures of twenty
26658: chapfallen companions.
26659: 
26660: But just as he had tried opium, so his thought now began to turn upon
26661: gambling—not with appetite for its excitement, but with a sort of
26662: wistful inward gaze after that easy way of getting money, which implied
26663: no asking and brought no responsibility. If he had been in London or
26664: Paris at that time, it is probable that such thoughts, seconded by
26665: opportunity, would have taken him into a gambling-house, no longer to
26666: watch the gamblers, but to watch with them in kindred eagerness.
26667: Repugnance would have been surmounted by the immense need to win, if
26668: chance would be kind enough to let him. An incident which happened not
26669: very long after that airy notion of getting aid from his uncle had been
26670: excluded, was a strong sign of the effect that might have followed any
26671: extant opportunity of gambling.
26672: 
26673: The billiard-room at the Green Dragon was the constant resort of a
26674: certain set, most of whom, like our acquaintance Mr. Bambridge, were
26675: regarded as men of pleasure. It was here that poor Fred Vincy had made
26676: part of his memorable debt, having lost money in betting, and been
26677: obliged to borrow of that gay companion. It was generally known in
26678: Middlemarch that a good deal of money was lost and won in this way; and
26679: the consequent repute of the Green Dragon as a place of dissipation
26680: naturally heightened in some quarters the temptation to go there.
26681: Probably its regular visitants, like the initiates of freemasonry,
26682: wished that there were something a little more tremendous to keep to
26683: themselves concerning it; but they were not a closed community, and
26684: many decent seniors as well as juniors occasionally turned into the
26685: billiard-room to see what was going on. Lydgate, who had the muscular
26686: aptitude for billiards, and was fond of the game, had once or twice in
26687: the early days after his arrival in Middlemarch taken his turn with the
26688: cue at the Green Dragon; but afterwards he had no leisure for the game,
26689: and no inclination for the socialities there. One evening, however, he
26690: had occasion to seek Mr. Bambridge at that resort. The horsedealer had
26691: engaged to get him a customer for his remaining good horse, for which
26692: Lydgate had determined to substitute a cheap hack, hoping by this
26693: reduction of style to get perhaps twenty pounds; and he cared now for
26694: every small sum, as a help towards feeding the patience of his
26695: tradesmen. To run up to the billiard-room, as he was passing, would
26696: save time.
26697: 
26698: Mr. Bambridge was not yet come, but would be sure to arrive by-and-by,
26699: said his friend Mr. Horrock; and Lydgate stayed, playing a game for the
26700: sake of passing the time. That evening he had the peculiar light in the
26701: eyes and the unusual vivacity which had been once noticed in him by Mr.
26702: Farebrother. The exceptional fact of his presence was much noticed in
26703: the room, where there was a good deal of Middlemarch company; and
26704: several lookers-on, as well as some of the players, were betting with
26705: animation. Lydgate was playing well, and felt confident; the bets were
26706: dropping round him, and with a swift glancing thought of the probable
26707: gain which might double the sum he was saving from his horse, he began
26708: to bet on his own play, and won again and again. Mr. Bambridge had come
26709: in, but Lydgate did not notice him. He was not only excited with his
26710: play, but visions were gleaming on him of going the next day to
26711: Brassing, where there was gambling on a grander scale to be had, and
26712: where, by one powerful snatch at the devil’s bait, he might carry it
26713: off without the hook, and buy his rescue from his daily solicitings.
26714: 
26715: He was still winning when two new visitors entered. One of them was a
26716: young Hawley, just come from his law studies in town, and the other was
26717: Fred Vincy, who had spent several evenings of late at this old haunt of
26718: his. Young Hawley, an accomplished billiard-player, brought a cool
26719: fresh hand to the cue. But Fred Vincy, startled at seeing Lydgate, and
26720: astonished to see him betting with an excited air, stood aside, and
26721: kept out of the circle round the table.
26722: 
26723: Fred had been rewarding resolution by a little laxity of late. He had
26724: been working heartily for six months at all outdoor occupations under
26725: Mr. Garth, and by dint of severe practice had nearly mastered the
26726: defects of his handwriting, this practice being, perhaps, a little the
26727: less severe that it was often carried on in the evening at Mr. Garth’s
26728: under the eyes of Mary. But the last fortnight Mary had been staying at
26729: Lowick Parsonage with the ladies there, during Mr. Farebrother’s
26730: residence in Middlemarch, where he was carrying out some parochial
26731: plans; and Fred, not seeing anything more agreeable to do, had turned
26732: into the Green Dragon, partly to play at billiards, partly to taste the
26733: old flavor of discourse about horses, sport, and things in general,
26734: considered from a point of view which was not strenuously correct. He
26735: had not been out hunting once this season, had had no horse of his own
26736: to ride, and had gone from place to place chiefly with Mr. Garth in his
26737: gig, or on the sober cob which Mr. Garth could lend him. It was a
26738: little too bad, Fred began to think, that he should be kept in the
26739: traces with more severity than if he had been a clergyman. “I will tell
26740: you what, Mistress Mary—it will be rather harder work to learn
26741: surveying and drawing plans than it would have been to write sermons,”
26742: he had said, wishing her to appreciate what he went through for her
26743: sake; “and as to Hercules and Theseus, they were nothing to me. They
26744: had sport, and never learned to write a bookkeeping hand.” And now,
26745: Mary being out of the way for a little while, Fred, like any other
26746: strong dog who cannot slip his collar, had pulled up the staple of his
26747: chain and made a small escape, not of course meaning to go fast or far.
26748: There could be no reason why he should not play at billiards, but he
26749: was determined not to bet. As to money just now, Fred had in his mind
26750: the heroic project of saving almost all of the eighty pounds that Mr.
26751: Garth offered him, and returning it, which he could easily do by giving
26752: up all futile money-spending, since he had a superfluous stock of
26753: clothes, and no expense in his board. In that way he could, in one
26754: year, go a good way towards repaying the ninety pounds of which he had
26755: deprived Mrs. Garth, unhappily at a time when she needed that sum more
26756: than she did now. Nevertheless, it must be acknowledged that on this
26757: evening, which was the fifth of his recent visits to the billiard-room,
26758: Fred had, not in his pocket, but in his mind, the ten pounds which he
26759: meant to reserve for himself from his half-year’s salary (having before
26760: him the pleasure of carrying thirty to Mrs. Garth when Mary was likely
26761: to be come home again)—he had those ten pounds in his mind as a fund
26762: from which he might risk something, if there were a chance of a good
26763: bet. Why? Well, when sovereigns were flying about, why shouldn’t he
26764: catch a few? He would never go far along that road again; but a man
26765: likes to assure himself, and men of pleasure generally, what he could
26766: do in the way of mischief if he chose, and that if he abstains from
26767: making himself ill, or beggaring himself, or talking with the utmost
26768: looseness which the narrow limits of human capacity will allow, it is
26769: not because he is a spooney. Fred did not enter into formal reasons,
26770: which are a very artificial, inexact way of representing the tingling
26771: returns of old habit, and the caprices of young blood: but there was
26772: lurking in him a prophetic sense that evening, that when he began to
26773: play he should also begin to bet—that he should enjoy some
26774: punch-drinking, and in general prepare himself for feeling “rather
26775: seedy” in the morning. It is in such indefinable movements that action
26776: often begins.
26777: 
26778: But the last thing likely to have entered Fred’s expectation was that
26779: he should see his brother-in-law Lydgate—of whom he had never quite
26780: dropped the old opinion that he was a prig, and tremendously conscious
26781: of his superiority—looking excited and betting, just as he himself
26782: might have done. Fred felt a shock greater than he could quite account
26783: for by the vague knowledge that Lydgate was in debt, and that his
26784: father had refused to help him; and his own inclination to enter into
26785: the play was suddenly checked. It was a strange reversal of attitudes:
26786: Fred’s blond face and blue eyes, usually bright and careless, ready to
26787: give attention to anything that held out a promise of amusement,
26788: looking involuntarily grave and almost embarrassed as if by the sight
26789: of something unfitting; while Lydgate, who had habitually an air of
26790: self-possessed strength, and a certain meditativeness that seemed to
26791: lie behind his most observant attention, was acting, watching, speaking
26792: with that excited narrow consciousness which reminds one of an animal
26793: with fierce eyes and retractile claws.
26794: 
26795: Lydgate, by betting on his own strokes, had won sixteen pounds; but
26796: young Hawley’s arrival had changed the poise of things. He made
26797: first-rate strokes himself, and began to bet against Lydgate’s strokes,
26798: the strain of whose nerves was thus changed from simple confidence in
26799: his own movements to defying another person’s doubt in them. The
26800: defiance was more exciting than the confidence, but it was less sure.
26801: He continued to bet on his own play, but began often to fail. Still he
26802: went on, for his mind was as utterly narrowed into that precipitous
26803: crevice of play as if he had been the most ignorant lounger there. Fred
26804: observed that Lydgate was losing fast, and found himself in the new
26805: situation of puzzling his brains to think of some device by which,
26806: without being offensive, he could withdraw Lydgate’s attention, and
26807: perhaps suggest to him a reason for quitting the room. He saw that
26808: others were observing Lydgate’s strange unlikeness to himself, and it
26809: occurred to him that merely to touch his elbow and call him aside for a
26810: moment might rouse him from his absorption. He could think of nothing
26811: cleverer than the daring improbability of saying that he wanted to see
26812: Rosy, and wished to know if she were at home this evening; and he was
26813: going desperately to carry out this weak device, when a waiter came up
26814: to him with a message, saying that Mr. Farebrother was below, and
26815: begged to speak with him.
26816: 
26817: Fred was surprised, not quite comfortably, but sending word that he
26818: would be down immediately, he went with a new impulse up to Lydgate,
26819: said, “Can I speak to you a moment?” and drew him aside.
26820: 
26821: “Farebrother has just sent up a message to say that he wants to speak
26822: to me. He is below. I thought you might like to know he was there, if
26823: you had anything to say to him.”
26824: 
26825: Fred had simply snatched up this pretext for speaking, because he could
26826: not say, “You are losing confoundedly, and are making everybody stare
26827: at you; you had better come away.” But inspiration could hardly have
26828: served him better. Lydgate had not before seen that Fred was present,
26829: and his sudden appearance with an announcement of Mr. Farebrother had
26830: the effect of a sharp concussion.
26831: 
26832: “No, no,” said Lydgate; “I have nothing particular to say to him.
26833: But—the game is up—I must be going—I came in just to see Bambridge.”
26834: 
26835: “Bambridge is over there, but he is making a row—I don’t think he’s
26836: ready for business. Come down with me to Farebrother. I expect he is
26837: going to blow me up, and you will shield me,” said Fred, with some
26838: adroitness.
26839: 
26840: Lydgate felt shame, but could not bear to act as if he felt it, by
26841: refusing to see Mr. Farebrother; and he went down. They merely shook
26842: hands, however, and spoke of the frost; and when all three had turned
26843: into the street, the Vicar seemed quite willing to say good-by to
26844: Lydgate. His present purpose was clearly to talk with Fred alone, and
26845: he said, kindly, “I disturbed you, young gentleman, because I have some
26846: pressing business with you. Walk with me to St. Botolph’s, will you?”
26847: 
26848: It was a fine night, the sky thick with stars, and Mr. Farebrother
26849: proposed that they should make a circuit to the old church by the
26850: London road. The next thing he said was—
26851: 
26852: “I thought Lydgate never went to the Green Dragon?”
26853: 
26854: “So did I,” said Fred. “But he said that he went to see Bambridge.”
26855: 
26856: “He was not playing, then?”
26857: 
26858: Fred had not meant to tell this, but he was obliged now to say, “Yes,
26859: he was. But I suppose it was an accidental thing. I have never seen him
26860: there before.”
26861: 
26862: “You have been going often yourself, then, lately?”
26863: 
26864: “Oh, about five or six times.”
26865: 
26866: “I think you had some good reason for giving up the habit of going
26867: there?”
26868: 
26869: “Yes. You know all about it,” said Fred, not liking to be catechised in
26870: this way. “I made a clean breast to you.”
26871: 
26872: “I suppose that gives me a warrant to speak about the matter now. It is
26873: understood between us, is it not?—that we are on a footing of open
26874: friendship: I have listened to you, and you will be willing to listen
26875: to me. I may take my turn in talking a little about myself?”
26876: 
26877: “I am under the deepest obligation to you, Mr. Farebrother,” said Fred,
26878: in a state of uncomfortable surmise.
26879: 
26880: “I will not affect to deny that you are under some obligation to me.
26881: But I am going to confess to you, Fred, that I have been tempted to
26882: reverse all that by keeping silence with you just now. When somebody
26883: said to me, ‘Young Vincy has taken to being at the billiard-table every
26884: night again—he won’t bear the curb long;’ I was tempted to do the
26885: opposite of what I am doing—to hold my tongue and wait while you went
26886: down the ladder again, betting first and then—”
26887: 
26888: “I have not made any bets,” said Fred, hastily.
26889: 
26890: “Glad to hear it. But I say, my prompting was to look on and see you
26891: take the wrong turning, wear out Garth’s patience, and lose the best
26892: opportunity of your life—the opportunity which you made some rather
26893: difficult effort to secure. You can guess the feeling which raised that
26894: temptation in me—I am sure you know it. I am sure you know that the
26895: satisfaction of your affections stands in the way of mine.”
26896: 
26897: There was a pause. Mr. Farebrother seemed to wait for a recognition of
26898: the fact; and the emotion perceptible in the tones of his fine voice
26899: gave solemnity to his words. But no feeling could quell Fred’s alarm.
26900: 
26901: “I could not be expected to give her up,” he said, after a moment’s
26902: hesitation: it was not a case for any pretence of generosity.
26903: 
26904: “Clearly not, when her affection met yours. But relations of this sort,
26905: even when they are of long standing, are always liable to change. I can
26906: easily conceive that you might act in a way to loosen the tie she feels
26907: towards you—it must be remembered that she is only conditionally bound
26908: to you—and that in that case, another man, who may flatter himself that
26909: he has a hold on her regard, might succeed in winning that firm place
26910: in her love as well as respect which you had let slip. I can easily
26911: conceive such a result,” repeated Mr. Farebrother, emphatically. “There
26912: is a companionship of ready sympathy, which might get the advantage
26913: even over the longest associations.” It seemed to Fred that if Mr.
26914: Farebrother had had a beak and talons instead of his very capable
26915: tongue, his mode of attack could hardly be more cruel. He had a
26916: horrible conviction that behind all this hypothetic statement there was
26917: a knowledge of some actual change in Mary’s feeling.
26918: 
26919: “Of course I know it might easily be all up with me,” he said, in a
26920: troubled voice. “If she is beginning to compare—” He broke off, not
26921: liking to betray all he felt, and then said, by the help of a little
26922: bitterness, “But I thought you were friendly to me.”
26923: 
26924: “So I am; that is why we are here. But I have had a strong disposition
26925: to be otherwise. I have said to myself, ‘If there is a likelihood of
26926: that youngster doing himself harm, why should you interfere? Aren’t you
26927: worth as much as he is, and don’t your sixteen years over and above
26928: his, in which you have gone rather hungry, give you more right to
26929: satisfaction than he has? If there’s a chance of his going to the dogs,
26930: let him—perhaps you could nohow hinder it—and do you take the
26931: benefit.’”
26932: 
26933: There was a pause, in which Fred was seized by a most uncomfortable
26934: chill. What was coming next? He dreaded to hear that something had been
26935: said to Mary—he felt as if he were listening to a threat rather than a
26936: warning. When the Vicar began again there was a change in his tone like
26937: the encouraging transition to a major key.
26938: 
26939: “But I had once meant better than that, and I am come back to my old
26940: intention. I thought that I could hardly _secure myself_ in it better,
26941: Fred, than by telling you just what had gone on in me. And now, do you
26942: understand me? I want you to make the happiness of her life and your
26943: own, and if there is any chance that a word of warning from me may turn
26944: aside any risk to the contrary—well, I have uttered it.”
26945: 
26946: There was a drop in the Vicar’s voice when he spoke the last words. He
26947: paused—they were standing on a patch of green where the road diverged
26948: towards St. Botolph’s, and he put out his hand, as if to imply that the
26949: conversation was closed. Fred was moved quite newly. Some one highly
26950: susceptible to the contemplation of a fine act has said, that it
26951: produces a sort of regenerating shudder through the frame, and makes
26952: one feel ready to begin a new life. A good degree of that effect was
26953: just then present in Fred Vincy.
26954: 
26955: “I will try to be worthy,” he said, breaking off before he could say
26956: “of you as well as of her.” And meanwhile Mr. Farebrother had gathered
26957: the impulse to say something more.
26958: 
26959: “You must not imagine that I believe there is at present any decline in
26960: her preference of you, Fred. Set your heart at rest, that if you keep
26961: right, other things will keep right.”
26962: 
26963: “I shall never forget what you have done,” Fred answered. “I can’t say
26964: anything that seems worth saying—only I will try that your goodness
26965: shall not be thrown away.”
26966: 
26967: “That’s enough. Good-by, and God bless you.”
26968: 
26969: In that way they parted. But both of them walked about a long while
26970: before they went out of the starlight. Much of Fred’s rumination might
26971: be summed up in the words, “It certainly would have been a fine thing
26972: for her to marry Farebrother—but if she loves me best and I am a good
26973: husband?”
26974: 
26975: Perhaps Mr. Farebrother’s might be concentrated into a single shrug and
26976: one little speech. “To think of the part one little woman can play in
26977: the life of a man, so that to renounce her may be a very good imitation
26978: of heroism, and to win her may be a discipline!”
26979: 
26980: 
26981: 
26982: 
26983: CHAPTER LXVII.
26984: 
26985: Now is there civil war within the soul:
26986: Resolve is thrust from off the sacred throne
26987: By clamorous Needs, and Pride the grand-vizier
26988: Makes humble compact, plays the supple part
26989: Of envoy and deft-tongued apologist
26990: For hungry rebels.
26991: 
26992: 
26993: Happily Lydgate had ended by losing in the billiard-room, and brought
26994: away no encouragement to make a raid on luck. On the contrary, he felt
26995: unmixed disgust with himself the next day when he had to pay four or
26996: five pounds over and above his gains, and he carried about with him a
26997: most unpleasant vision of the figure he had made, not only rubbing
26998: elbows with the men at the Green Dragon but behaving just as they did.
26999: A philosopher fallen to betting is hardly distinguishable from a
27000: Philistine under the same circumstances: the difference will chiefly be
27001: found in his subsequent reflections, and Lydgate chewed a very
27002: disagreeable cud in that way. His reason told him how the affair might
27003: have been magnified into ruin by a slight change of scenery—if it had
27004: been a gambling-house that he had turned into, where chance could be
27005: clutched with both hands instead of being picked up with thumb and
27006: fore-finger. Nevertheless, though reason strangled the desire to
27007: gamble, there remained the feeling that, with an assurance of luck to
27008: the needful amount, he would have liked to gamble, rather than take the
27009: alternative which was beginning to urge itself as inevitable.
27010: 
27011: That alternative was to apply to Mr. Bulstrode. Lydgate had so many
27012: times boasted both to himself and others that he was totally
27013: independent of Bulstrode, to whose plans he had lent himself solely
27014: because they enabled him to carry out his own ideas of professional
27015: work and public benefit—he had so constantly in their personal
27016: intercourse had his pride sustained by the sense that he was making a
27017: good social use of this predominating banker, whose opinions he thought
27018: contemptible and whose motives often seemed to him an absurd mixture of
27019: contradictory impressions—that he had been creating for himself strong
27020: ideal obstacles to the proffering of any considerable request to him on
27021: his own account.
27022: 
27023: Still, early in March his affairs were at that pass in which men begin
27024: to say that their oaths were delivered in ignorance, and to perceive
27025: that the act which they had called impossible to them is becoming
27026: manifestly possible. With Dover’s ugly security soon to be put in
27027: force, with the proceeds of his practice immediately absorbed in paying
27028: back debts, and with the chance, if the worst were known, of daily
27029: supplies being refused on credit, above all with the vision of
27030: Rosamond’s hopeless discontent continually haunting him, Lydgate had
27031: begun to see that he should inevitably bend himself to ask help from
27032: somebody or other. At first he had considered whether he should write
27033: to Mr. Vincy; but on questioning Rosamond he found that, as he had
27034: suspected, she had already applied twice to her father, the last time
27035: being since the disappointment from Sir Godwin; and papa had said that
27036: Lydgate must look out for himself. “Papa said he had come, with one bad
27037: year after another, to trade more and more on borrowed capital, and had
27038: had to give up many indulgences; he could not spare a single hundred
27039: from the charges of his family. He said, let Lydgate ask Bulstrode:
27040: they have always been hand and glove.”
27041: 
27042: Indeed, Lydgate himself had come to the conclusion that if he must end
27043: by asking for a free loan, his relations with Bulstrode, more at least
27044: than with any other man, might take the shape of a claim which was not
27045: purely personal. Bulstrode had indirectly helped to cause the failure
27046: of his practice, and had also been highly gratified by getting a
27047: medical partner in his plans:—but who among us ever reduced himself to
27048: the sort of dependence in which Lydgate now stood, without trying to
27049: believe that he had claims which diminished the humiliation of asking?
27050: It was true that of late there had seemed to be a new languor of
27051: interest in Bulstrode about the Hospital; but his health had got worse,
27052: and showed signs of a deep-seated nervous affection. In other respects
27053: he did not appear to be changed: he had always been highly polite, but
27054: Lydgate had observed in him from the first a marked coldness about his
27055: marriage and other private circumstances, a coldness which he had
27056: hitherto preferred to any warmth of familiarity between them. He
27057: deferred the intention from day to day, his habit of acting on his
27058: conclusions being made infirm by his repugnance to every possible
27059: conclusion and its consequent act. He saw Mr. Bulstrode often, but he
27060: did not try to use any occasion for his private purpose. At one moment
27061: he thought, “I will write a letter: I prefer that to any circuitous
27062: talk;” at another he thought, “No; if I were talking to him, I could
27063: make a retreat before any signs of disinclination.”
27064: 
27065: Still the days passed and no letter was written, no special interview
27066: sought. In his shrinking from the humiliation of a dependent attitude
27067: towards Bulstrode, he began to familiarize his imagination with another
27068: step even more unlike his remembered self. He began spontaneously to
27069: consider whether it would be possible to carry out that puerile notion
27070: of Rosamond’s which had often made him angry, namely, that they should
27071: quit Middlemarch without seeing anything beyond that preface. The
27072: question came—“Would any man buy the practice of me even now, for as
27073: little as it is worth? Then the sale might happen as a necessary
27074: preparation for going away.”
27075: 
27076: But against his taking this step, which he still felt to be a
27077: contemptible relinquishment of present work, a guilty turning aside
27078: from what was a real and might be a widening channel for worthy
27079: activity, to start again without any justified destination, there was
27080: this obstacle, that the purchaser, if procurable at all, might not be
27081: quickly forthcoming. And afterwards? Rosamond in a poor lodging, though
27082: in the largest city or most distant town, would not find the life that
27083: could save her from gloom, and save him from the reproach of having
27084: plunged her into it. For when a man is at the foot of the hill in his
27085: fortunes, he may stay a long while there in spite of professional
27086: accomplishment. In the British climate there is no incompatibility
27087: between scientific insight and furnished lodgings: the incompatibility
27088: is chiefly between scientific ambition and a wife who objects to that
27089: kind of residence.
27090: 
27091: But in the midst of his hesitation, opportunity came to decide him. A
27092: note from Mr. Bulstrode requested Lydgate to call on him at the Bank. A
27093: hypochondriacal tendency had shown itself in the banker’s constitution
27094: of late; and a lack of sleep, which was really only a slight
27095: exaggeration of an habitual dyspeptic symptom, had been dwelt on by him
27096: as a sign of threatening insanity. He wanted to consult Lydgate without
27097: delay on that particular morning, although he had nothing to tell
27098: beyond what he had told before. He listened eagerly to what Lydgate had
27099: to say in dissipation of his fears, though this too was only
27100: repetition; and this moment in which Bulstrode was receiving a medical
27101: opinion with a sense of comfort, seemed to make the communication of a
27102: personal need to him easier than it had been in Lydgate’s contemplation
27103: beforehand. He had been insisting that it would be well for Mr.
27104: Bulstrode to relax his attention to business.
27105: 
27106: “One sees how any mental strain, however slight, may affect a delicate
27107: frame,” said Lydgate at that stage of the consultation when the remarks
27108: tend to pass from the personal to the general, “by the deep stamp which
27109: anxiety will make for a time even on the young and vigorous. I am
27110: naturally very strong; yet I have been thoroughly shaken lately by an
27111: accumulation of trouble.”
27112: 
27113: “I presume that a constitution in the susceptible state in which mine
27114: at present is, would be especially liable to fall a victim to cholera,
27115: if it visited our district. And since its appearance near London, we
27116: may well besiege the Mercy-seat for our protection,” said Mr.
27117: Bulstrode, not intending to evade Lydgate’s allusion, but really
27118: preoccupied with alarms about himself.
27119: 
27120: “You have at all events taken your share in using good practical
27121: precautions for the town, and that is the best mode of asking for
27122: protection,” said Lydgate, with a strong distaste for the broken
27123: metaphor and bad logic of the banker’s religion, somewhat increased by
27124: the apparent deafness of his sympathy. But his mind had taken up its
27125: long-prepared movement towards getting help, and was not yet arrested.
27126: He added, “The town has done well in the way of cleansing, and finding
27127: appliances; and I think that if the cholera should come, even our
27128: enemies will admit that the arrangements in the Hospital are a public
27129: good.”
27130: 
27131: “Truly,” said Mr. Bulstrode, with some coldness. “With regard to what
27132: you say, Mr. Lydgate, about the relaxation of my mental labor, I have
27133: for some time been entertaining a purpose to that effect—a purpose of a
27134: very decided character. I contemplate at least a temporary withdrawal
27135: from the management of much business, whether benevolent or commercial.
27136: Also I think of changing my residence for a time: probably I shall
27137: close or let ‘The Shrubs,’ and take some place near the coast—under
27138: advice of course as to salubrity. That would be a measure which you
27139: would recommend?”
27140: 
27141: “Oh yes,” said Lydgate, falling backward in his chair, with
27142: ill-repressed impatience under the banker’s pale earnest eyes and
27143: intense preoccupation with himself.
27144: 
27145: “I have for some time felt that I should open this subject with you in
27146: relation to our Hospital,” continued Bulstrode. “Under the
27147: circumstances I have indicated, of course I must cease to have any
27148: personal share in the management, and it is contrary to my views of
27149: responsibility to continue a large application of means to an
27150: institution which I cannot watch over and to some extent regulate. I
27151: shall therefore, in case of my ultimate decision to leave Middlemarch,
27152: consider that I withdraw other support to the New Hospital than that
27153: which will subsist in the fact that I chiefly supplied the expenses of
27154: building it, and have contributed further large sums to its successful
27155: working.”
27156: 
27157: Lydgate’s thought, when Bulstrode paused according to his wont, was,
27158: “He has perhaps been losing a good deal of money.” This was the most
27159: plausible explanation of a speech which had caused rather a startling
27160: change in his expectations. He said in reply—
27161: 
27162: “The loss to the Hospital can hardly be made up, I fear.”
27163: 
27164: “Hardly,” returned Bulstrode, in the same deliberate, silvery tone;
27165: “except by some changes of plan. The only person who may be certainly
27166: counted on as willing to increase her contributions is Mrs. Casaubon. I
27167: have had an interview with her on the subject, and I have pointed out
27168: to her, as I am about to do to you, that it will be desirable to win a
27169: more general support to the New Hospital by a change of system.”
27170: Another pause, but Lydgate did not speak.
27171: 
27172: “The change I mean is an amalgamation with the Infirmary, so that the
27173: New Hospital shall be regarded as a special addition to the elder
27174: institution, having the same directing board. It will be necessary,
27175: also, that the medical management of the two shall be combined. In this
27176: way any difficulty as to the adequate maintenance of our new
27177: establishment will be removed; the benevolent interests of the town
27178: will cease to be divided.”
27179: 
27180: Mr. Bulstrode had lowered his eyes from Lydgate’s face to the buttons
27181: of his coat as he again paused.
27182: 
27183: “No doubt that is a good device as to ways and means,” said Lydgate,
27184: with an edge of irony in his tone. “But I can’t be expected to rejoice
27185: in it at once, since one of the first results will be that the other
27186: medical men will upset or interrupt my methods, if it were only because
27187: they are mine.”
27188: 
27189: “I myself, as you know, Mr. Lydgate, highly valued the opportunity of
27190: new and independent procedure which you have diligently employed: the
27191: original plan, I confess, was one which I had much at heart, under
27192: submission to the Divine Will. But since providential indications
27193: demand a renunciation from me, I renounce.”
27194: 
27195: Bulstrode showed a rather exasperating ability in this conversation.
27196: The broken metaphor and bad logic of motive which had stirred his
27197: hearer’s contempt were quite consistent with a mode of putting the
27198: facts which made it difficult for Lydgate to vent his own indignation
27199: and disappointment. After some rapid reflection, he only asked—
27200: 
27201: “What did Mrs. Casaubon say?”
27202: 
27203: “That was the further statement which I wished to make to you,” said
27204: Bulstrode, who had thoroughly prepared his ministerial explanation.
27205: “She is, you are aware, a woman of most munificent disposition, and
27206: happily in possession—not I presume of great wealth, but of funds which
27207: she can well spare. She has informed me that though she has destined
27208: the chief part of those funds to another purpose, she is willing to
27209: consider whether she cannot fully take my place in relation to the
27210: Hospital. But she wishes for ample time to mature her thoughts on the
27211: subject, and I have told her that there is no need for haste—that, in
27212: fact, my own plans are not yet absolute.”
27213: 
27214: Lydgate was ready to say, “If Mrs. Casaubon would take your place,
27215: there would be gain, instead of loss.” But there was still a weight on
27216: his mind which arrested this cheerful candor. He replied, “I suppose,
27217: then, that I may enter into the subject with Mrs. Casaubon.”
27218: 
27219: “Precisely; that is what she expressly desires. Her decision, she says,
27220: will much depend on what you can tell her. But not at present: she is,
27221: I believe, just setting out on a journey. I have her letter here,” said
27222: Mr. Bulstrode, drawing it out, and reading from it. “‘I am immediately
27223: otherwise engaged,’ she says. ‘I am going into Yorkshire with Sir James
27224: and Lady Chettam; and the conclusions I come to about some land which I
27225: am to see there may affect my power of contributing to the Hospital.’
27226: Thus, Mr. Lydgate, there is no haste necessary in this matter; but I
27227: wished to apprise you beforehand of what may possibly occur.”
27228: 
27229: Mr. Bulstrode returned the letter to his side-pocket, and changed his
27230: attitude as if his business were closed. Lydgate, whose renewed hope
27231: about the Hospital only made him more conscious of the facts which
27232: poisoned his hope, felt that his effort after help, if made at all,
27233: must be made now and vigorously.
27234: 
27235: “I am much obliged to you for giving me full notice,” he said, with a
27236: firm intention in his tone, yet with an interruptedness in his delivery
27237: which showed that he spoke unwillingly. “The highest object to me is my
27238: profession, and I had identified the Hospital with the best use I can
27239: at present make of my profession. But the best use is not always the
27240: same with monetary success. Everything which has made the Hospital
27241: unpopular has helped with other causes—I think they are all connected
27242: with my professional zeal—to make me unpopular as a practitioner. I get
27243: chiefly patients who can’t pay me. I should like them best, if I had
27244: nobody to pay on my own side.” Lydgate waited a little, but Bulstrode
27245: only bowed, looking at him fixedly, and he went on with the same
27246: interrupted enunciation—as if he were biting an objectional leek.
27247: 
27248: “I have slipped into money difficulties which I can see no way out of,
27249: unless some one who trusts me and my future will advance me a sum
27250: without other security. I had very little fortune left when I came
27251: here. I have no prospects of money from my own family. My expenses, in
27252: consequence of my marriage, have been very much greater than I had
27253: expected. The result at this moment is that it would take a thousand
27254: pounds to clear me. I mean, to free me from the risk of having all my
27255: goods sold in security of my largest debt—as well as to pay my other
27256: debts—and leave anything to keep us a little beforehand with our small
27257: income. I find that it is out of the question that my wife’s father
27258: should make such an advance. That is why I mention my position to—to
27259: the only other man who may be held to have some personal connection
27260: with my prosperity or ruin.”
27261: 
27262: Lydgate hated to hear himself. But he had spoken now, and had spoken
27263: with unmistakable directness. Mr. Bulstrode replied without haste, but
27264: also without hesitation.
27265: 
27266: “I am grieved, though, I confess, not surprised by this information,
27267: Mr. Lydgate. For my own part, I regretted your alliance with my
27268: brother-in-law’s family, which has always been of prodigal habits, and
27269: which has already been much indebted to me for sustainment in its
27270: present position. My advice to you, Mr. Lydgate, would be, that instead
27271: of involving yourself in further obligations, and continuing a doubtful
27272: struggle, you should simply become a bankrupt.”
27273: 
27274: “That would not improve my prospect,” said Lydgate, rising and speaking
27275: bitterly, “even if it were a more agreeable thing in itself.”
27276: 
27277: “It is always a trial,” said Mr. Bulstrode; “but trial, my dear sir, is
27278: our portion here, and is a needed corrective. I recommend you to weigh
27279: the advice I have given.”
27280: 
27281: “Thank you,” said Lydgate, not quite knowing what he said. “I have
27282: occupied you too long. Good-day.”
27283: 
27284:

27287: CHAPTER LXVIII.
27288: 
27289: What suit of grace hath Virtue to put on
27290: If Vice shall wear as good, and do as well?
27291: If Wrong, if Craft, if Indiscretion
27292: Act as fair parts with ends as laudable?
27293: Which all this mighty volume of events
27294: The world, the universal map of deeds,
27295: Strongly controls, and proves from all descents,
27296: That the directest course still best succeeds.
27297: For should not grave and learn’d Experience
27298: That looks with the eyes of all the world beside,
27299: And with all ages holds intelligence,
27300: Go safer than Deceit without a guide!
27301: —DANIEL: _Musophilus_.
27302: 
27303: 
27304: That change of plan and shifting of interest which Bulstrode stated or
27305: betrayed in his conversation with Lydgate, had been determined in him
27306: by some severe experience which he had gone through since the epoch of
27307: Mr. Larcher’s sale, when Raffles had recognized Will Ladislaw, and when
27308: the banker had in vain attempted an act of restitution which might move
27309: Divine Providence to arrest painful consequences.
27310: 
27311: His certainty that Raffles, unless he were dead, would return to
27312: Middlemarch before long, had been justified. On Christmas Eve he had
27313: reappeared at The Shrubs. Bulstrode was at home to receive him, and
27314: hinder his communication with the rest of the family, but he could not
27315: altogether hinder the circumstances of the visit from compromising
27316: himself and alarming his wife. Raffles proved more unmanageable than he
27317: had shown himself to be in his former appearances, his chronic state of
27318: mental restlessness, the growing effect of habitual intemperance,
27319: quickly shaking off every impression from what was said to him. He
27320: insisted on staying in the house, and Bulstrode, weighing two sets of
27321: evils, felt that this was at least not a worse alternative than his
27322: going into the town. He kept him in his own room for the evening and
27323: saw him to bed, Raffles all the while amusing himself with the
27324: annoyance he was causing this decent and highly prosperous
27325: fellow-sinner, an amusement which he facetiously expressed as sympathy
27326: with his friend’s pleasure in entertaining a man who had been
27327: serviceable to him, and who had not had all his earnings. There was a
27328: cunning calculation under this noisy joking—a cool resolve to extract
27329: something the handsomer from Bulstrode as payment for release from this
27330: new application of torture. But his cunning had a little overcast its
27331: mark.
27332: 
27333: Bulstrode was indeed more tortured than the coarse fibre of Raffles
27334: could enable him to imagine. He had told his wife that he was simply
27335: taking care of this wretched creature, the victim of vice, who might
27336: otherwise injure himself; he implied, without the direct form of
27337: falsehood, that there was a family tie which bound him to this care,
27338: and that there were signs of mental alienation in Raffles which urged
27339: caution. He would himself drive the unfortunate being away the next
27340: morning. In these hints he felt that he was supplying Mrs. Bulstrode
27341: with precautionary information for his daughters and servants, and
27342: accounting for his allowing no one but himself to enter the room even
27343: with food and drink. But he sat in an agony of fear lest Raffles should
27344: be overheard in his loud and plain references to past facts—lest Mrs.
27345: Bulstrode should be even tempted to listen at the door. How could he
27346: hinder her, how betray his terror by opening the door to detect her?
27347: She was a woman of honest direct habits, and little likely to take so
27348: low a course in order to arrive at painful knowledge; but fear was
27349: stronger than the calculation of probabilities.
27350: 
27351: In this way Raffles had pushed the torture too far, and produced an
27352: effect which had not been in his plan. By showing himself hopelessly
27353: unmanageable he had made Bulstrode feel that a strong defiance was the
27354: only resource left. After taking Raffles to bed that night the banker
27355: ordered his closed carriage to be ready at half-past seven the next
27356: morning. At six o’clock he had already been long dressed, and had spent
27357: some of his wretchedness in prayer, pleading his motives for averting
27358: the worst evil if in anything he had used falsity and spoken what was
27359: not true before God. For Bulstrode shrank from a direct lie with an
27360: intensity disproportionate to the number of his more indirect misdeeds.
27361: But many of these misdeeds were like the subtle muscular movements
27362: which are not taken account of in the consciousness, though they bring
27363: about the end that we fix our mind on and desire. And it is only what
27364: we are vividly conscious of that we can vividly imagine to be seen by
27365: Omniscience.
27366: 
27367: Bulstrode carried his candle to the bedside of Raffles, who was
27368: apparently in a painful dream. He stood silent, hoping that the
27369: presence of the light would serve to waken the sleeper gradually and
27370: gently, for he feared some noise as the consequence of a too sudden
27371: awakening. He had watched for a couple of minutes or more the
27372: shudderings and pantings which seemed likely to end in waking, when
27373: Raffles, with a long half-stifled moan, started up and stared round him
27374: in terror, trembling and gasping. But he made no further noise, and
27375: Bulstrode, setting down the candle, awaited his recovery.
27376: 
27377: It was a quarter of an hour later before Bulstrode, with a cold
27378: peremptoriness of manner which he had not before shown, said, “I came
27379: to call you thus early, Mr. Raffles, because I have ordered the
27380: carriage to be ready at half-past seven, and intend myself to conduct
27381: you as far as Ilsely, where you can either take the railway or await a
27382: coach.” Raffles was about to speak, but Bulstrode anticipated him
27383: imperiously with the words, “Be silent, sir, and hear what I have to
27384: say. I shall supply you with money now, and I will furnish you with a
27385: reasonable sum from time to time, on your application to me by letter;
27386: but if you choose to present yourself here again, if you return to
27387: Middlemarch, if you use your tongue in a manner injurious to me, you
27388: will have to live on such fruits as your malice can bring you, without
27389: help from me. Nobody will pay you well for blasting my name: I know the
27390: worst you can do against me, and I shall brave it if you dare to thrust
27391: yourself upon me again. Get up, sir, and do as I order you, without
27392: noise, or I will send for a policeman to take you off my premises, and
27393: you may carry your stories into every pothouse in the town, but you
27394: shall have no sixpence from me to pay your expenses there.”
27395: 
27396: Bulstrode had rarely in his life spoken with such nervous energy: he
27397: had been deliberating on this speech and its probable effects through a
27398: large part of the night; and though he did not trust to its ultimately
27399: saving him from any return of Raffles, he had concluded that it was the
27400: best throw he could make. It succeeded in enforcing submission from the
27401: jaded man this morning: his empoisoned system at this moment quailed
27402: before Bulstrode’s cold, resolute bearing, and he was taken off quietly
27403: in the carriage before the family breakfast time. The servants imagined
27404: him to be a poor relation, and were not surprised that a strict man
27405: like their master, who held his head high in the world, should be
27406: ashamed of such a cousin and want to get rid of him. The banker’s drive
27407: of ten miles with his hated companion was a dreary beginning of the
27408: Christmas day; but at the end of the drive, Raffles had recovered his
27409: spirits, and parted in a contentment for which there was the good
27410: reason that the banker had given him a hundred pounds. Various motives
27411: urged Bulstrode to this open-handedness, but he did not himself inquire
27412: closely into all of them. As he had stood watching Raffles in his
27413: uneasy sleep, it had certainly entered his mind that the man had been
27414: much shattered since the first gift of two hundred pounds.
27415: 
27416: He had taken care to repeat the incisive statement of his resolve not
27417: to be played on any more; and had tried to penetrate Raffles with the
27418: fact that he had shown the risks of bribing him to be quite equal to
27419: the risks of defying him. But when, freed from his repulsive presence,
27420: Bulstrode returned to his quiet home, he brought with him no confidence
27421: that he had secured more than a respite. It was as if he had had a
27422: loathsome dream, and could not shake off its images with their hateful
27423: kindred of sensations—as if on all the pleasant surroundings of his
27424: life a dangerous reptile had left his slimy traces.
27425: 
27426: Who can know how much of his most inward life is made up of the
27427: thoughts he believes other men to have about him, until that fabric of
27428: opinion is threatened with ruin?
27429: 
27430: Bulstrode was only the more conscious that there was a deposit of
27431: uneasy presentiment in his wife’s mind, because she carefully avoided
27432: any allusion to it. He had been used every day to taste the flavor of
27433: supremacy and the tribute of complete deference: and the certainty that
27434: he was watched or measured with a hidden suspicion of his having some
27435: discreditable secret, made his voice totter when he was speaking to
27436: edification. Foreseeing, to men of Bulstrode’s anxious temperament, is
27437: often worse than seeing; and his imagination continually heightened the
27438: anguish of an imminent disgrace. Yes, imminent; for if his defiance of
27439: Raffles did not keep the man away—and though he prayed for this result
27440: he hardly hoped for it—the disgrace was certain. In vain he said to
27441: himself that, if permitted, it would be a divine visitation, a
27442: chastisement, a preparation; he recoiled from the imagined burning; and
27443: he judged that it must be more for the Divine glory that he should
27444: escape dishonor. That recoil had at last urged him to make preparations
27445: for quitting Middlemarch. If evil truth must be reported of him, he
27446: would then be at a less scorching distance from the contempt of his old
27447: neighbors; and in a new scene, where his life would not have gathered
27448: the same wide sensibility, the tormentor, if he pursued him, would be
27449: less formidable. To leave the place finally would, he knew, be
27450: extremely painful to his wife, and on other grounds he would have
27451: preferred to stay where he had struck root. Hence he made his
27452: preparations at first in a conditional way, wishing to leave on all
27453: sides an opening for his return after brief absence, if any favorable
27454: intervention of Providence should dissipate his fears. He was preparing
27455: to transfer his management of the Bank, and to give up any active
27456: control of other commercial affairs in the neighborhood, on the ground
27457: of his failing health, but without excluding his future resumption of
27458: such work. The measure would cause him some added expense and some
27459: diminution of income beyond what he had already undergone from the
27460: general depression of trade; and the Hospital presented itself as a
27461: principal object of outlay on which he could fairly economize.
27462: 
27463: This was the experience which had determined his conversation with
27464: Lydgate. But at this time his arrangements had most of them gone no
27465: farther than a stage at which he could recall them if they proved to be
27466: unnecessary. He continually deferred the final steps; in the midst of
27467: his fears, like many a man who is in danger of shipwreck or of being
27468: dashed from his carriage by runaway horses, he had a clinging
27469: impression that something would happen to hinder the worst, and that to
27470: spoil his life by a late transplantation might be over-hasty—especially
27471: since it was difficult to account satisfactorily to his wife for the
27472: project of their indefinite exile from the only place where she would
27473: like to live.
27474: 
27475: Among the affairs Bulstrode had to care for, was the management of the
27476: farm at Stone Court in case of his absence; and on this as well as on
27477: all other matters connected with any houses and land he possessed in or
27478: about Middlemarch, he had consulted Caleb Garth. Like every one else
27479: who had business of that sort, he wanted to get the agent who was more
27480: anxious for his employer’s interests than his own. With regard to Stone
27481: Court, since Bulstrode wished to retain his hold on the stock, and to
27482: have an arrangement by which he himself could, if he chose, resume his
27483: favorite recreation of superintendence, Caleb had advised him not to
27484: trust to a mere bailiff, but to let the land, stock, and implements
27485: yearly, and take a proportionate share of the proceeds.
27486: 
27487: “May I trust to you to find me a tenant on these terms, Mr. Garth?”
27488: said Bulstrode. “And will you mention to me the yearly sum which would
27489: repay you for managing these affairs which we have discussed together?”
27490: 
27491: “I’ll think about it,” said Caleb, in his blunt way. “I’ll see how I
27492: can make it out.”
27493: 
27494: If it had not been that he had to consider Fred Vincy’s future, Mr.
27495: Garth would not probably have been glad of any addition to his work, of
27496: which his wife was always fearing an excess for him as he grew older.
27497: But on quitting Bulstrode after that conversation, a very alluring idea
27498: occurred to him about this said letting of Stone Court. What if
27499: Bulstrode would agree to his placing Fred Vincy there on the
27500: understanding that he, Caleb Garth, should be responsible for the
27501: management? It would be an excellent schooling for Fred; he might make
27502: a modest income there, and still have time left to get knowledge by
27503: helping in other business. He mentioned his notion to Mrs. Garth with
27504: such evident delight that she could not bear to chill his pleasure by
27505: expressing her constant fear of his undertaking too much.
27506: 
27507: “The lad would be as happy as two,” he said, throwing himself back in
27508: his chair, and looking radiant, “if I could tell him it was all
27509: settled. Think; Susan! His mind had been running on that place for
27510: years before old Featherstone died. And it would be as pretty a turn of
27511: things as could be that he should hold the place in a good industrious
27512: way after all—by his taking to business. For it’s likely enough
27513: Bulstrode might let him go on, and gradually buy the stock. He hasn’t
27514: made up his mind, I can see, whether or not he shall settle somewhere
27515: else as a lasting thing. I never was better pleased with a notion in my
27516: life. And then the children might be married by-and-by, Susan.”
27517: 
27518: “You will not give any hint of the plan to Fred, until you are sure
27519: that Bulstrode would agree to the plan?” said Mrs. Garth, in a tone of
27520: gentle caution. “And as to marriage, Caleb, we old people need not help
27521: to hasten it.”
27522: 
27523: “Oh, I don’t know,” said Caleb, swinging his head aside. “Marriage is a
27524: taming thing. Fred would want less of my bit and bridle. However, I
27525: shall say nothing till I know the ground I’m treading on. I shall speak
27526: to Bulstrode again.”
27527: 
27528: He took his earliest opportunity of doing so. Bulstrode had anything
27529: but a warm interest in his nephew Fred Vincy, but he had a strong wish
27530: to secure Mr. Garth’s services on many scattered points of business at
27531: which he was sure to be a considerable loser, if they were under less
27532: conscientious management. On that ground he made no objection to Mr.
27533: Garth’s proposal; and there was also another reason why he was not
27534: sorry to give a consent which was to benefit one of the Vincy family.
27535: It was that Mrs. Bulstrode, having heard of Lydgate’s debts, had been
27536: anxious to know whether her husband could not do something for poor
27537: Rosamond, and had been much troubled on learning from him that
27538: Lydgate’s affairs were not easily remediable, and that the wisest plan
27539: was to let them “take their course.” Mrs. Bulstrode had then said for
27540: the first time, “I think you are always a little hard towards my
27541: family, Nicholas. And I am sure I have no reason to deny any of my
27542: relatives. Too worldly they may be, but no one ever had to say that
27543: they were not respectable.”
27544: 
27545: “My dear Harriet,” said Mr. Bulstrode, wincing under his wife’s eyes,
27546: which were filling with tears, “I have supplied your brother with a
27547: great deal of capital. I cannot be expected to take care of his married
27548: children.”
27549: 
27550: That seemed to be true, and Mrs. Bulstrode’s remonstrance subsided into
27551: pity for poor Rosamond, whose extravagant education she had always
27552: foreseen the fruits of.
27553: 
27554: But remembering that dialogue, Mr. Bulstrode felt that when he had to
27555: talk to his wife fully about his plan of quitting Middlemarch, he
27556: should be glad to tell her that he had made an arrangement which might
27557: be for the good of her nephew Fred. At present he had merely mentioned
27558: to her that he thought of shutting up The Shrubs for a few months, and
27559: taking a house on the Southern Coast.
27560: 
27561: Hence Mr. Garth got the assurance he desired, namely, that in case of
27562: Bulstrode’s departure from Middlemarch for an indefinite time, Fred
27563: Vincy should be allowed to have the tenancy of Stone Court on the terms
27564: proposed.
27565: 
27566: Caleb was so elated with his hope of this “neat turn” being given to
27567: things, that if his self-control had not been braced by a little
27568: affectionate wifely scolding, he would have betrayed everything to
27569: Mary, wanting “to give the child comfort.” However, he restrained
27570: himself, and kept in strict privacy from Fred certain visits which he
27571: was making to Stone Court, in order to look more thoroughly into the
27572: state of the land and stock, and take a preliminary estimate. He was
27573: certainly more eager in these visits than the probable speed of events
27574: required him to be; but he was stimulated by a fatherly delight in
27575: occupying his mind with this bit of probable happiness which he held in
27576: store like a hidden birthday gift for Fred and Mary.
27577: 
27578: “But suppose the whole scheme should turn out to be a castle in the
27579: air?” said Mrs. Garth.
27580: 
27581: “Well, well,” replied Caleb; “the castle will tumble about nobody’s
27582: head.”
27583: 
27584: 
27585: 
27586: 
27587: CHAPTER LXIX.
27588: 
27589: “If thou hast heard a word, let it die with thee.”
27590: —_Ecclesiasticus_.
27591: 
27592: 
27593: Mr. Bulstrode was still seated in his manager’s room at the Bank, about
27594: three o’clock of the same day on which he had received Lydgate there,
27595: when the clerk entered to say that his horse was waiting, and also that
27596: Mr. Garth was outside and begged to speak with him.
27597: 
27598: “By all means,” said Bulstrode; and Caleb entered. “Pray sit down, Mr.
27599: Garth,” continued the banker, in his suavest tone.
27600: 
27601: “I am glad that you arrived just in time to find me here. I know you
27602: count your minutes.”
27603: 
27604: “Oh,” said Caleb, gently, with a slow swing of his head on one side, as
27605: he seated himself and laid his hat on the floor.
27606: 
27607: He looked at the ground, leaning forward and letting his long fingers
27608: droop between his legs, while each finger moved in succession, as if it
27609: were sharing some thought which filled his large quiet brow.
27610: 
27611: Mr. Bulstrode, like every one else who knew Caleb, was used to his
27612: slowness in beginning to speak on any topic which he felt to be
27613: important, and rather expected that he was about to recur to the buying
27614: of some houses in Blindman’s Court, for the sake of pulling them down,
27615: as a sacrifice of property which would be well repaid by the influx of
27616: air and light on that spot. It was by propositions of this kind that
27617: Caleb was sometimes troublesome to his employers; but he had usually
27618: found Bulstrode ready to meet him in projects of improvement, and they
27619: had got on well together. When he spoke again, however, it was to say,
27620: in rather a subdued voice—
27621: 
27622: “I have just come away from Stone Court, Mr. Bulstrode.”
27623: 
27624: “You found nothing wrong there, I hope,” said the banker; “I was there
27625: myself yesterday. Abel has done well with the lambs this year.”
27626: 
27627: “Why, yes,” said Caleb, looking up gravely, “there is something wrong—a
27628: stranger, who is very ill, I think. He wants a doctor, and I came to
27629: tell you of that. His name is Raffles.”
27630: 
27631: He saw the shock of his words passing through Bulstrode’s frame. On
27632: this subject the banker had thought that his fears were too constantly
27633: on the watch to be taken by surprise; but he had been mistaken.
27634: 
27635: “Poor wretch!” he said in a compassionate tone, though his lips
27636: trembled a little. “Do you know how he came there?”
27637: 
27638: “I took him myself,” said Caleb, quietly—“took him up in my gig. He had
27639: got down from the coach, and was walking a little beyond the turning
27640: from the toll-house, and I overtook him. He remembered seeing me with
27641: you once before, at Stone Court, and he asked me to take him on. I saw
27642: he was ill: it seemed to me the right thing to do, to carry him under
27643: shelter. And now I think you should lose no time in getting advice for
27644: him.” Caleb took up his hat from the floor as he ended, and rose slowly
27645: from his seat.
27646: 
27647: “Certainly,” said Bulstrode, whose mind was very active at this moment.
27648: “Perhaps you will yourself oblige me, Mr. Garth, by calling at Mr.
27649: Lydgate’s as you pass—or stay! he may at this hour probably be at the
27650: Hospital. I will first send my man on the horse there with a note this
27651: instant, and then I will myself ride to Stone Court.”
27652: 
27653: Bulstrode quickly wrote a note, and went out himself to give the
27654: commission to his man. When he returned, Caleb was standing as before
27655: with one hand on the back of the chair, holding his hat with the other.
27656: In Bulstrode’s mind the dominant thought was, “Perhaps Raffles only
27657: spoke to Garth of his illness. Garth may wonder, as he must have done
27658: before, at this disreputable fellow’s claiming intimacy with me; but he
27659: will know nothing. And he is friendly to me—I can be of use to him.”
27660: 
27661: He longed for some confirmation of this hopeful conjecture, but to have
27662: asked any question as to what Raffles had said or done would have been
27663: to betray fear.
27664: 
27665: “I am exceedingly obliged to you, Mr. Garth,” he said, in his usual
27666: tone of politeness. “My servant will be back in a few minutes, and I
27667: shall then go myself to see what can be done for this unfortunate man.
27668: Perhaps you had some other business with me? If so, pray be seated.”
27669: 
27670: “Thank you,” said Caleb, making a slight gesture with his right hand to
27671: waive the invitation. “I wish to say, Mr. Bulstrode, that I must
27672: request you to put your business into some other hands than mine. I am
27673: obliged to you for your handsome way of meeting me—about the letting of
27674: Stone Court, and all other business. But I must give it up.” A sharp
27675: certainty entered like a stab into Bulstrode’s soul.
27676: 
27677: “This is sudden, Mr. Garth,” was all he could say at first.
27678: 
27679: “It is,” said Caleb; “but it is quite fixed. I must give it up.”
27680: 
27681: He spoke with a firmness which was very gentle, and yet he could see
27682: that Bulstrode seemed to cower under that gentleness, his face looking
27683: dried and his eyes swerving away from the glance which rested on him.
27684: Caleb felt a deep pity for him, but he could have used no pretexts to
27685: account for his resolve, even if they would have been of any use.
27686: 
27687: “You have been led to this, I apprehend, by some slanders concerning me
27688: uttered by that unhappy creature,” said Bulstrode, anxious now to know
27689: the utmost.
27690: 
27691: “That is true. I can’t deny that I act upon what I heard from him.”
27692: 
27693: “You are a conscientious man, Mr. Garth—a man, I trust, who feels
27694: himself accountable to God. You would not wish to injure me by being
27695: too ready to believe a slander,” said Bulstrode, casting about for
27696: pleas that might be adapted to his hearer’s mind. “That is a poor
27697: reason for giving up a connection which I think I may say will be
27698: mutually beneficial.”
27699: 
27700: “I would injure no man if I could help it,” said Caleb; “even if I
27701: thought God winked at it. I hope I should have a feeling for my
27702: fellow-creature. But, sir—I am obliged to believe that this Raffles has
27703: told me the truth. And I can’t be happy in working with you, or
27704: profiting by you. It hurts my mind. I must beg you to seek another
27705: agent.”
27706: 
27707: “Very well, Mr. Garth. But I must at least claim to know the worst that
27708: he has told you. I must know what is the foul speech that I am liable
27709: to be the victim of,” said Bulstrode, a certain amount of anger
27710: beginning to mingle with his humiliation before this quiet man who
27711: renounced his benefits.
27712: 
27713: “That’s needless,” said Caleb, waving his hand, bowing his head
27714: slightly, and not swerving from the tone which had in it the merciful
27715: intention to spare this pitiable man. “What he has said to me will
27716: never pass from my lips, unless something now unknown forces it from
27717: me. If you led a harmful life for gain, and kept others out of their
27718: rights by deceit, to get the more for yourself, I dare say you
27719: repent—you would like to go back, and can’t: that must be a bitter
27720: thing”—Caleb paused a moment and shook his head—“it is not for me to
27721: make your life harder to you.”
27722: 
27723: “But you do—you do make it harder to me,” said Bulstrode constrained
27724: into a genuine, pleading cry. “You make it harder to me by turning your
27725: back on me.”
27726: 
27727: “That I’m forced to do,” said Caleb, still more gently, lifting up his
27728: hand. “I am sorry. I don’t judge you and say, he is wicked, and I am
27729: righteous. God forbid. I don’t know everything. A man may do wrong, and
27730: his will may rise clear out of it, though he can’t get his life clear.
27731: That’s a bad punishment. If it is so with you,—well, I’m very sorry for
27732: you. But I have that feeling inside me, that I can’t go on working with
27733: you. That’s all, Mr. Bulstrode. Everything else is buried, so far as my
27734: will goes. And I wish you good-day.”
27735: 
27736: “One moment, Mr. Garth!” said Bulstrode, hurriedly. “I may trust then
27737: to your solemn assurance that you will not repeat either to man or
27738: woman what—even if it have any degree of truth in it—is yet a malicious
27739: representation?” Caleb’s wrath was stirred, and he said, indignantly—
27740: 
27741: “Why should I have said it if I didn’t mean it? I am in no fear of you.
27742: Such tales as that will never tempt my tongue.”
27743: 
27744: “Excuse me—I am agitated—I am the victim of this abandoned man.”
27745: 
27746: “Stop a bit! you have got to consider whether you didn’t help to make
27747: him worse, when you profited by his vices.”
27748: 
27749: “You are wronging me by too readily believing him,” said Bulstrode,
27750: oppressed, as by a nightmare, with the inability to deny flatly what
27751: Raffles might have said; and yet feeling it an escape that Caleb had
27752: not so stated it to him as to ask for that flat denial.
27753: 
27754: “No,” said Caleb, lifting his hand deprecatingly; “I am ready to
27755: believe better, when better is proved. I rob you of no good chance. As
27756: to speaking, I hold it a crime to expose a man’s sin unless I’m clear
27757: it must be done to save the innocent. That is my way of thinking, Mr.
27758: Bulstrode, and what I say, I’ve no need to swear. I wish you good-day.”
27759: 
27760: Some hours later, when he was at home, Caleb said to his wife,
27761: incidentally, that he had had some little differences with Bulstrode,
27762: and that in consequence, he had given up all notion of taking Stone
27763: Court, and indeed had resigned doing further business for him.
27764: 
27765: “He was disposed to interfere too much, was he?” said Mrs. Garth,
27766: imagining that her husband had been touched on his sensitive point, and
27767: not been allowed to do what he thought right as to materials and modes
27768: of work.
27769: 
27770: “Oh,” said Caleb, bowing his head and waving his hand gravely. And Mrs.
27771: Garth knew that this was a sign of his not intending to speak further
27772: on the subject.
27773: 
27774: As for Bulstrode, he had almost immediately mounted his horse and set
27775: off for Stone Court, being anxious to arrive there before Lydgate.
27776: 
27777: His mind was crowded with images and conjectures, which were a language
27778: to his hopes and fears, just as we hear tones from the vibrations which
27779: shake our whole system. The deep humiliation with which he had winced
27780: under Caleb Garth’s knowledge of his past and rejection of his
27781: patronage, alternated with and almost gave way to the sense of safety
27782: in the fact that Garth, and no other, had been the man to whom Raffles
27783: had spoken. It seemed to him a sort of earnest that Providence intended
27784: his rescue from worse consequences; the way being thus left open for
27785: the hope of secrecy. That Raffles should be afflicted with illness,
27786: that he should have been led to Stone Court rather than
27787: elsewhere—Bulstrode’s heart fluttered at the vision of probabilities
27788: which these events conjured up. If it should turn out that he was freed
27789: from all danger of disgrace—if he could breathe in perfect liberty—his
27790: life should be more consecrated than it had ever been before. He
27791: mentally lifted up this vow as if it would urge the result he longed
27792: for—he tried to believe in the potency of that prayerful resolution—its
27793: potency to determine death. He knew that he ought to say, “Thy will be
27794: done;” and he said it often. But the intense desire remained that the
27795: will of God might be the death of that hated man.
27796: 
27797: Yet when he arrived at Stone Court he could not see the change in
27798: Raffles without a shock. But for his pallor and feebleness, Bulstrode
27799: would have called the change in him entirely mental. Instead of his
27800: loud tormenting mood, he showed an intense, vague terror, and seemed to
27801: deprecate Bulstrode’s anger, because the money was all gone—he had been
27802: robbed—it had half of it been taken from him. He had only come here
27803: because he was ill and somebody was hunting him—somebody was after him,
27804: he had told nobody anything, he had kept his mouth shut. Bulstrode, not
27805: knowing the significance of these symptoms, interpreted this new
27806: nervous susceptibility into a means of alarming Raffles into true
27807: confessions, and taxed him with falsehood in saying that he had not
27808: told anything, since he had just told the man who took him up in his
27809: gig and brought him to Stone Court. Raffles denied this with solemn
27810: adjurations; the fact being that the links of consciousness were
27811: interrupted in him, and that his minute terror-stricken narrative to
27812: Caleb Garth had been delivered under a set of visionary impulses which
27813: had dropped back into darkness.
27814: 
27815: Bulstrode’s heart sank again at this sign that he could get no grasp
27816: over the wretched man’s mind, and that no word of Raffles could be
27817: trusted as to the fact which he most wanted to know, namely, whether or
27818: not he had really kept silence to every one in the neighborhood except
27819: Caleb Garth. The housekeeper had told him without the least constraint
27820: of manner that since Mr. Garth left, Raffles had asked her for beer,
27821: and after that had not spoken, seeming very ill. On that side it might
27822: be concluded that there had been no betrayal. Mrs. Abel thought, like
27823: the servants at The Shrubs, that the strange man belonged to the
27824: unpleasant “kin” who are among the troubles of the rich; she had at
27825: first referred the kinship to Mr. Rigg, and where there was property
27826: left, the buzzing presence of such large blue-bottles seemed natural
27827: enough. How he could be “kin” to Bulstrode as well was not so clear,
27828: but Mrs. Abel agreed with her husband that there was “no knowing,” a
27829: proposition which had a great deal of mental food for her, so that she
27830: shook her head over it without further speculation.
27831: 
27832: In less than an hour Lydgate arrived. Bulstrode met him outside the
27833: wainscoted parlor, where Raffles was, and said—
27834: 
27835: “I have called you in, Mr. Lydgate, to an unfortunate man who was once
27836: in my employment, many years ago. Afterwards he went to America, and
27837: returned I fear to an idle dissolute life. Being destitute, he has a
27838: claim on me. He was slightly connected with Rigg, the former owner of
27839: this place, and in consequence found his way here. I believe he is
27840: seriously ill: apparently his mind is affected. I feel bound to do the
27841: utmost for him.”
27842: 
27843: Lydgate, who had the remembrance of his last conversation with
27844: Bulstrode strongly upon him, was not disposed to say an unnecessary
27845: word to him, and bowed slightly in answer to this account; but just
27846: before entering the room he turned automatically and said, “What is his
27847: name?”—to know names being as much a part of the medical man’s
27848: accomplishment as of the practical politician’s.
27849: 
27850: “Raffles, John Raffles,” said Bulstrode, who hoped that whatever became
27851: of Raffles, Lydgate would never know any more of him.
27852: 
27853: When he had thoroughly examined and considered the patient, Lydgate
27854: ordered that he should go to bed, and be kept there in as complete
27855: quiet as possible, and then went with Bulstrode into another room.
27856: 
27857: “It is a serious case, I apprehend,” said the banker, before Lydgate
27858: began to speak.
27859: 
27860: “No—and yes,” said Lydgate, half dubiously. “It is difficult to decide
27861: as to the possible effect of long-standing complications; but the man
27862: had a robust constitution to begin with. I should not expect this
27863: attack to be fatal, though of course the system is in a ticklish state.
27864: He should be well watched and attended to.”
27865: 
27866: “I will remain here myself,” said Bulstrode. “Mrs. Abel and her husband
27867: are inexperienced. I can easily remain here for the night, if you will
27868: oblige me by taking a note for Mrs. Bulstrode.”
27869: 
27870: “I should think that is hardly necessary,” said Lydgate. “He seems tame
27871: and terrified enough. He might become more unmanageable. But there is a
27872: man here—is there not?”
27873: 
27874: “I have more than once stayed here a few nights for the sake of
27875: seclusion,” said Bulstrode, indifferently; “I am quite disposed to do
27876: so now. Mrs. Abel and her husband can relieve or aid me, if necessary.”
27877: 
27878: “Very well. Then I need give my directions only to you,” said Lydgate,
27879: not feeling surprised at a little peculiarity in Bulstrode.
27880: 
27881: “You think, then, that the case is hopeful?” said Bulstrode, when
27882: Lydgate had ended giving his orders.
27883: 
27884: “Unless there turn out to be further complications, such as I have not
27885: at present detected—yes,” said Lydgate. “He may pass on to a worse
27886: stage; but I should not wonder if he got better in a few days, by
27887: adhering to the treatment I have prescribed. There must be firmness.
27888: Remember, if he calls for liquors of any sort, not to give them to him.
27889: In my opinion, men in his condition are oftener killed by treatment
27890: than by the disease. Still, new symptoms may arise. I shall come again
27891: to-morrow morning.”
27892: 
27893: After waiting for the note to be carried to Mrs. Bulstrode, Lydgate
27894: rode away, forming no conjectures, in the first instance, about the
27895: history of Raffles, but rehearsing the whole argument, which had lately
27896: been much stirred by the publication of Dr. Ware’s abundant experience
27897: in America, as to the right way of treating cases of alcoholic
27898: poisoning such as this. Lydgate, when abroad, had already been
27899: interested in this question: he was strongly convinced against the
27900: prevalent practice of allowing alcohol and persistently administering
27901: large doses of opium; and he had repeatedly acted on this conviction
27902: with a favorable result.
27903: 
27904: “The man is in a diseased state,” he thought, “but there’s a good deal
27905: of wear in him still. I suppose he is an object of charity to
27906: Bulstrode. It is curious what patches of hardness and tenderness lie
27907: side by side in men’s dispositions. Bulstrode seems the most
27908: unsympathetic fellow I ever saw about some people, and yet he has taken
27909: no end of trouble, and spent a great deal of money, on benevolent
27910: objects. I suppose he has some test by which he finds out whom Heaven
27911: cares for—he has made up his mind that it doesn’t care for me.”
27912: 
27913: This streak of bitterness came from a plenteous source, and kept
27914: widening in the current of his thought as he neared Lowick Gate. He had
27915: not been there since his first interview with Bulstrode in the morning,
27916: having been found at the Hospital by the banker’s messenger; and for
27917: the first time he was returning to his home without the vision of any
27918: expedient in the background which left him a hope of raising money
27919: enough to deliver him from the coming destitution of everything which
27920: made his married life tolerable—everything which saved him and Rosamond
27921: from that bare isolation in which they would be forced to recognize how
27922: little of a comfort they could be to each other. It was more bearable
27923: to do without tenderness for himself than to see that his own
27924: tenderness could make no amends for the lack of other things to her.
27925: The sufferings of his own pride from humiliations past and to come were
27926: keen enough, yet they were hardly distinguishable to himself from that
27927: more acute pain which dominated them—the pain of foreseeing that
27928: Rosamond would come to regard him chiefly as the cause of
27929: disappointment and unhappiness to her. He had never liked the
27930: makeshifts of poverty, and they had never before entered into his
27931: prospects for himself; but he was beginning now to imagine how two
27932: creatures who loved each other, and had a stock of thoughts in common,
27933: might laugh over their shabby furniture, and their calculations how far
27934: they could afford butter and eggs. But the glimpse of that poetry
27935: seemed as far off from him as the carelessness of the golden age; in
27936: poor Rosamond’s mind there was not room enough for luxuries to look
27937: small in. He got down from his horse in a very sad mood, and went into
27938: the house, not expecting to be cheered except by his dinner, and
27939: reflecting that before the evening closed it would be wise to tell
27940: Rosamond of his application to Bulstrode and its failure. It would be
27941: well not to lose time in preparing her for the worst.
27942: 
27943: But his dinner waited long for him before he was able to eat it. For on
27944: entering he found that Dover’s agent had already put a man in the
27945: house, and when he asked where Mrs. Lydgate was, he was told that she
27946: was in her bedroom. He went up and found her stretched on the bed pale
27947: and silent, without an answer even in her face to any word or look of
27948: his. He sat down by the bed and leaning over her said with almost a cry
27949: of prayer—
27950: 
27951: “Forgive me for this misery, my poor Rosamond! Let us only love one
27952: another.”
27953: 
27954: She looked at him silently, still with the blank despair on her face;
27955: but then the tears began to fill her blue eyes, and her lip trembled.
27956: The strong man had had too much to bear that day. He let his head fall
27957: beside hers and sobbed.
27958: 
27959: He did not hinder her from going to her father early in the morning—it
27960: seemed now that he ought not to hinder her from doing as she pleased.
27961: In half an hour she came back, and said that papa and mamma wished her
27962: to go and stay with them while things were in this miserable state.
27963: Papa said he could do nothing about the debt—if he paid this, there
27964: would be half-a-dozen more. She had better come back home again till
27965: Lydgate had got a comfortable home for her. “Do you object, Tertius?”
27966: 
27967: “Do as you like,” said Lydgate. “But things are not coming to a crisis
27968: immediately. There is no hurry.”
27969: 
27970: “I should not go till to-morrow,” said Rosamond; “I shall want to pack
27971: my clothes.”
27972: 
27973: “Oh, I would wait a little longer than to-morrow—there is no knowing
27974: what may happen,” said Lydgate, with bitter irony. “I may get my neck
27975: broken, and that may make things easier to you.”
27976: 
27977: It was Lydgate’s misfortune and Rosamond’s too, that his tenderness
27978: towards her, which was both an emotional prompting and a
27979: well-considered resolve, was inevitably interrupted by these outbursts
27980: of indignation either ironical or remonstrant. She thought them totally
27981: unwarranted, and the repulsion which this exceptional severity excited
27982: in her was in danger of making the more persistent tenderness
27983: unacceptable.
27984: 
27985: “I see you do not wish me to go,” she said, with chill mildness; “why
27986: can you not say so, without that kind of violence? I shall stay until
27987: you request me to do otherwise.”
27988: 
27989: Lydgate said no more, but went out on his rounds. He felt bruised and
27990: shattered, and there was a dark line under his eyes which Rosamond had
27991: not seen before. She could not bear to look at him. Tertius had a way
27992: of taking things which made them a great deal worse for her.
27993: 
27994: 
27995: 
27996: 
27997: CHAPTER LXX.
27998: 
27999: “Our deeds still travel with us from afar,
28000: And what we have been makes us what we are.”
28001: 
28002: 
28003: Bulstrode’s first object after Lydgate had left Stone Court was to
28004: examine Raffles’s pockets, which he imagined were sure to carry signs
28005: in the shape of hotel-bills of the places he had stopped in, if he had
28006: not told the truth in saying that he had come straight from Liverpool
28007: because he was ill and had no money. There were various bills crammed
28008: into his pocketbook, but none of a later date than Christmas at any
28009: other place, except one, which bore date that morning. This was
28010: crumpled up with a hand-bill about a horse-fair in one of his
28011: tail-pockets, and represented the cost of three days’ stay at an inn at
28012: Bilkley, where the fair was held—a town at least forty miles from
28013: Middlemarch. The bill was heavy, and since Raffles had no luggage with
28014: him, it seemed probable that he had left his portmanteau behind in
28015: payment, in order to save money for his travelling fare; for his purse
28016: was empty, and he had only a couple of sixpences and some loose pence
28017: in his pockets.
28018: 
28019: Bulstrode gathered a sense of safety from these indications that
28020: Raffles had really kept at a distance from Middlemarch since his
28021: memorable visit at Christmas. At a distance and among people who were
28022: strangers to Bulstrode, what satisfaction could there be to Raffles’s
28023: tormenting, self-magnifying vein in telling old scandalous stories
28024: about a Middlemarch banker? And what harm if he did talk? The chief
28025: point now was to keep watch over him as long as there was any danger of
28026: that intelligible raving, that unaccountable impulse to tell, which
28027: seemed to have acted towards Caleb Garth; and Bulstrode felt much
28028: anxiety lest some such impulse should come over him at the sight of
28029: Lydgate. He sat up alone with him through the night, only ordering the
28030: housekeeper to lie down in her clothes, so as to be ready when he
28031: called her, alleging his own indisposition to sleep, and his anxiety to
28032: carry out the doctor’s orders. He did carry them out faithfully,
28033: although Raffles was incessantly asking for brandy, and declaring that
28034: he was sinking away—that the earth was sinking away from under him. He
28035: was restless and sleepless, but still quailing and manageable. On the
28036: offer of the food ordered by Lydgate, which he refused, and the denial
28037: of other things which he demanded, he seemed to concentrate all his
28038: terror on Bulstrode, imploringly deprecating his anger, his revenge on
28039: him by starvation, and declaring with strong oaths that he had never
28040: told any mortal a word against him. Even this Bulstrode felt that he
28041: would not have liked Lydgate to hear; but a more alarming sign of
28042: fitful alternation in his delirium was, that in-the morning twilight
28043: Raffles suddenly seemed to imagine a doctor present, addressing him and
28044: declaring that Bulstrode wanted to starve him to death out of revenge
28045: for telling, when he never had told.
28046: 
28047: Bulstrode’s native imperiousness and strength of determination served
28048: him well. This delicate-looking man, himself nervously perturbed, found
28049: the needed stimulus in his strenuous circumstances, and through that
28050: difficult night and morning, while he had the air of an animated corpse
28051: returned to movement without warmth, holding the mastery by its chill
28052: impassibility, his mind was intensely at work thinking of what he had
28053: to guard against and what would win him security. Whatever prayers he
28054: might lift up, whatever statements he might inwardly make of this man’s
28055: wretched spiritual condition, and the duty he himself was under to
28056: submit to the punishment divinely appointed for him rather than to wish
28057: for evil to another—through all this effort to condense words into a
28058: solid mental state, there pierced and spread with irresistible
28059: vividness the images of the events he desired. And in the train of
28060: those images came their apology. He could not but see the death of
28061: Raffles, and see in it his own deliverance. What was the removal of
28062: this wretched creature? He was impenitent—but were not public criminals
28063: impenitent?—yet the law decided on their fate. Should Providence in
28064: this case award death, there was no sin in contemplating death as the
28065: desirable issue—if he kept his hands from hastening it—if he
28066: scrupulously did what was prescribed. Even here there might be a
28067: mistake: human prescriptions were fallible things: Lydgate had said
28068: that treatment had hastened death,—why not his own method of treatment?
28069: But of course intention was everything in the question of right and
28070: wrong.
28071: 
28072: And Bulstrode set himself to keep his intention separate from his
28073: desire. He inwardly declared that he intended to obey orders. Why
28074: should he have got into any argument about the validity of these
28075: orders? It was only the common trick of desire—which avails itself of
28076: any irrelevant scepticism, finding larger room for itself in all
28077: uncertainty about effects, in every obscurity that looks like the
28078: absence of law. Still, he did obey the orders.
28079: 
28080: His anxieties continually glanced towards Lydgate, and his remembrance
28081: of what had taken place between them the morning before was accompanied
28082: with sensibilities which had not been roused at all during the actual
28083: scene. He had then cared but little about Lydgate’s painful impressions
28084: with regard to the suggested change in the Hospital, or about the
28085: disposition towards himself which what he held to be his justifiable
28086: refusal of a rather exorbitant request might call forth. He recurred to
28087: the scene now with a perception that he had probably made Lydgate his
28088: enemy, and with an awakened desire to propitiate him, or rather to
28089: create in him a strong sense of personal obligation. He regretted that
28090: he had not at once made even an unreasonable money-sacrifice. For in
28091: case of unpleasant suspicions, or even knowledge gathered from the
28092: raving of Raffles, Bulstrode would have felt that he had a defence in
28093: Lydgate’s mind by having conferred a momentous benefit on him. But the
28094: regret had perhaps come too late.
28095: 
28096: Strange, piteous conflict in the soul of this unhappy man, who had
28097: longed for years to be better than he was—who had taken his selfish
28098: passions into discipline and clad them in severe robes, so that he had
28099: walked with them as a devout choir, till now that a terror had risen
28100: among them, and they could chant no longer, but threw out their common
28101: cries for safety.
28102: 
28103: It was nearly the middle of the day before Lydgate arrived: he had
28104: meant to come earlier, but had been detained, he said; and his
28105: shattered looks were noticed by Balstrode. But he immediately threw
28106: himself into the consideration of the patient, and inquired strictly
28107: into all that had occurred. Raffles was worse, would take hardly any
28108: food, was persistently wakeful and restlessly raving; but still not
28109: violent. Contrary to Bulstrode’s alarmed expectation, he took little
28110: notice of Lydgate’s presence, and continued to talk or murmur
28111: incoherently.
28112: 
28113: “What do you think of him?” said Bulstrode, in private.
28114: 
28115: “The symptoms are worse.”
28116: 
28117: “You are less hopeful?”
28118: 
28119: “No; I still think he may come round. Are you going to stay here
28120: yourself?” said Lydgate, looking at Bulstrode with an abrupt question,
28121: which made him uneasy, though in reality it was not due to any
28122: suspicious conjecture.
28123: 
28124: “Yes, I think so,” said Bulstrode, governing himself and speaking with
28125: deliberation. “Mrs. Bulstrode is advised of the reasons which detain
28126: me. Mrs. Abel and her husband are not experienced enough to be left
28127: quite alone, and this kind of responsibility is scarcely included in
28128: their service of me. You have some fresh instructions, I presume.”
28129: 
28130: The chief new instruction that Lydgate had to give was on the
28131: administration of extremely moderate doses of opium, in case of the
28132: sleeplessness continuing after several hours. He had taken the
28133: precaution of bringing opium in his pocket, and he gave minute
28134: directions to Bulstrode as to the doses, and the point at which they
28135: should cease. He insisted on the risk of not ceasing; and repeated his
28136: order that no alcohol should be given.
28137: 
28138: “From what I see of the case,” he ended, “narcotism is the only thing I
28139: should be much afraid of. He may wear through even without much food.
28140: There’s a good deal of strength in him.”
28141: 
28142: “You look ill yourself, Mr. Lydgate—a most unusual, I may say
28143: unprecedented thing in my knowledge of you,” said Bulstrode, showing a
28144: solicitude as unlike his indifference the day before, as his present
28145: recklessness about his own fatigue was unlike his habitual
28146: self-cherishing anxiety. “I fear you are harassed.”
28147: 
28148: “Yes, I am,” said Lydgate, brusquely, holding his hat, and ready to go.
28149: 
28150: “Something new, I fear,” said Bulstrode, inquiringly. “Pray be seated.”
28151: 
28152: “No, thank you,” said Lydgate, with some hauteur. “I mentioned to you
28153: yesterday what was the state of my affairs. There is nothing to add,
28154: except that the execution has since then been actually put into my
28155: house. One can tell a good deal of trouble in a short sentence. I will
28156: say good morning.”
28157: 
28158: “Stay, Mr. Lydgate, stay,” said Bulstrode; “I have been reconsidering
28159: this subject. I was yesterday taken by surprise, and saw it
28160: superficially. Mrs. Bulstrode is anxious for her niece, and I myself
28161: should grieve at a calamitous change in your position. Claims on me are
28162: numerous, but on reconsideration, I esteem it right that I should incur
28163: a small sacrifice rather than leave you unaided. You said, I think,
28164: that a thousand pounds would suffice entirely to free you from your
28165: burthens, and enable you to recover a firm stand?”
28166: 
28167: “Yes,” said Lydgate, a great leap of joy within him surmounting every
28168: other feeling; “that would pay all my debts, and leave me a little on
28169: hand. I could set about economizing in our way of living. And by-and-by
28170: my practice might look up.”
28171: 
28172: “If you will wait a moment, Mr. Lydgate, I will draw a check to that
28173: amount. I am aware that help, to be effectual in these cases, should be
28174: thorough.”
28175: 
28176: While Bulstrode wrote, Lydgate turned to the window thinking of his
28177: home—thinking of his life with its good start saved from frustration,
28178: its good purposes still unbroken.
28179: 
28180: “You can give me a note of hand for this, Mr. Lydgate,” said the
28181: banker, advancing towards him with the check. “And by-and-by, I hope,
28182: you may be in circumstances gradually to repay me. Meanwhile, I have
28183: pleasure in thinking that you will be released from further
28184: difficulty.”
28185: 
28186: “I am deeply obliged to you,” said Lydgate. “You have restored to me
28187: the prospect of working with some happiness and some chance of good.”
28188: 
28189: It appeared to him a very natural movement in Bulstrode that he should
28190: have reconsidered his refusal: it corresponded with the more munificent
28191: side of his character. But as he put his hack into a canter, that he
28192: might get the sooner home, and tell the good news to Rosamond, and get
28193: cash at the bank to pay over to Dover’s agent, there crossed his mind,
28194: with an unpleasant impression, as from a dark-winged flight of evil
28195: augury across his vision, the thought of that contrast in himself which
28196: a few months had brought—that he should be overjoyed at being under a
28197: strong personal obligation—that he should be overjoyed at getting money
28198: for himself from Bulstrode.
28199: 
28200: The banker felt that he had done something to nullify one cause of
28201: uneasiness, and yet he was scarcely the easier. He did not measure the
28202: quantity of diseased motive which had made him wish for Lydgate’s
28203: good-will, but the quantity was none the less actively there, like an
28204: irritating agent in his blood. A man vows, and yet will not cast away
28205: the means of breaking his vow. Is it that he distinctly means to break
28206: it? Not at all; but the desires which tend to break it are at work in
28207: him dimly, and make their way into his imagination, and relax his
28208: muscles in the very moments when he is telling himself over again the
28209: reasons for his vow. Raffles, recovering quickly, returning to the free
28210: use of his odious powers—how could Bulstrode wish for that? Raffles
28211: dead was the image that brought release, and indirectly he prayed for
28212: that way of release, beseeching that, if it were possible, the rest of
28213: his days here below might be freed from the threat of an ignominy which
28214: would break him utterly as an instrument of God’s service. Lydgate’s
28215: opinion was not on the side of promise that this prayer would be
28216: fulfilled; and as the day advanced, Bulstrode felt himself getting
28217: irritated at the persistent life in this man, whom he would fain have
28218: seen sinking into the silence of death: imperious will stirred
28219: murderous impulses towards this brute life, over which will, by itself,
28220: had no power. He said inwardly that he was getting too much worn; he
28221: would not sit up with the patient to-night, but leave him to Mrs. Abel,
28222: who, if necessary, could call her husband.
28223: 
28224: At six o’clock, Raffles, having had only fitful perturbed snatches of
28225: sleep, from which he waked with fresh restlessness and perpetual cries
28226: that he was sinking away, Bulstrode began to administer the opium
28227: according to Lydgate’s directions. At the end of half an hour or more
28228: he called Mrs. Abel and told her that he found himself unfit for
28229: further watching. He must now consign the patient to her care; and he
28230: proceeded to repeat to her Lydgate’s directions as to the quantity of
28231: each dose. Mrs. Abel had not before known anything of Lydgate’s
28232: prescriptions; she had simply prepared and brought whatever Bulstrode
28233: ordered, and had done what he pointed out to her. She began now to ask
28234: what else she should do besides administering the opium.
28235: 
28236: “Nothing at present, except the offer of the soup or the soda-water:
28237: you can come to me for further directions. Unless there is any
28238: important change, I shall not come into the room again to-night. You
28239: will ask your husband for help if necessary. I must go to bed early.”
28240: 
28241: “You’ve much need, sir, I’m sure,” said Mrs. Abel, “and to take
28242: something more strengthening than what you’ve done.”
28243: 
28244: Bulstrode went away now without anxiety as to what Raffles might say in
28245: his raving, which had taken on a muttering incoherence not likely to
28246: create any dangerous belief. At any rate he must risk this. He went
28247: down into the wainscoted parlor first, and began to consider whether he
28248: would not have his horse saddled and go home by the moonlight, and give
28249: up caring for earthly consequences. Then, he wished that he had begged
28250: Lydgate to come again that evening. Perhaps he might deliver a
28251: different opinion, and think that Raffles was getting into a less
28252: hopeful state. Should he send for Lydgate? If Raffles were really
28253: getting worse, and slowly dying, Bulstrode felt that he could go to bed
28254: and sleep in gratitude to Providence. But was he worse? Lydgate might
28255: come and simply say that he was going on as he expected, and predict
28256: that he would by-and-by fall into a good sleep, and get well. What was
28257: the use of sending for him? Bulstrode shrank from that result. No ideas
28258: or opinions could hinder him from seeing the one probability to be,
28259: that Raffles recovered would be just the same man as before, with his
28260: strength as a tormentor renewed, obliging him to drag away his wife to
28261: spend her years apart from her friends and native place, carrying an
28262: alienating suspicion against him in her heart.
28263: 
28264: He had sat an hour and a half in this conflict by the firelight only,
28265: when a sudden thought made him rise and light the bed-candle, which he
28266: had brought down with him. The thought was, that he had not told Mrs.
28267: Abel when the doses of opium must cease.
28268: 
28269: He took hold of the candlestick, but stood motionless for a long while.
28270: She might already have given him more than Lydgate had prescribed. But
28271: it was excusable in him, that he should forget part of an order, in his
28272: present wearied condition. He walked up-stairs, candle in hand, not
28273: knowing whether he should straightway enter his own room and go to bed,
28274: or turn to the patient’s room and rectify his omission. He paused in
28275: the passage, with his face turned towards Raffles’s room, and he could
28276: hear him moaning and murmuring. He was not asleep, then. Who could know
28277: that Lydgate’s prescription would not be better disobeyed than
28278: followed, since there was still no sleep?
28279: 
28280: He turned into his own room. Before he had quite undressed, Mrs. Abel
28281: rapped at the door; he opened it an inch, so that he could hear her
28282: speak low.
28283: 
28284: “If you please, sir, should I have no brandy nor nothing to give the
28285: poor creetur? He feels sinking away, and nothing else will he
28286: swaller—and but little strength in it, if he did—only the opium. And he
28287: says more and more he’s sinking down through the earth.”
28288: 
28289: To her surprise, Mr. Bulstrode did not answer. A struggle was going on
28290: within him.
28291: 
28292: “I think he must die for want o’ support, if he goes on in that way.
28293: When I nursed my poor master, Mr. Robisson, I had to give him port-wine
28294: and brandy constant, and a big glass at a time,” added Mrs. Abel, with
28295: a touch of remonstrance in her tone.
28296: 
28297: But again Mr. Bulstrode did not answer immediately, and she continued,
28298: “It’s not a time to spare when people are at death’s door, nor would
28299: you wish it, sir, I’m sure. Else I should give him our own bottle o’
28300: rum as we keep by us. But a sitter-up so as you’ve been, and doing
28301: everything as laid in your power—”
28302: 
28303: Here a key was thrust through the inch of doorway, and Mr. Bulstrode
28304: said huskily, “That is the key of the wine-cooler. You will find plenty
28305: of brandy there.”
28306: 
28307: Early in the morning—about six—Mr. Bulstrode rose and spent some time
28308: in prayer. Does any one suppose that private prayer is necessarily
28309: candid—necessarily goes to the roots of action? Private prayer is
28310: inaudible speech, and speech is representative: who can represent
28311: himself just as he is, even in his own reflections? Bulstrode had not
28312: yet unravelled in his thought the confused promptings of the last
28313: four-and-twenty hours.
28314: 
28315: He listened in the passage, and could hear hard stertorous breathing.
28316: Then he walked out in the garden, and looked at the early rime on the
28317: grass and fresh spring leaves. When he re-entered the house, he felt
28318: startled at the sight of Mrs. Abel.
28319: 
28320: “How is your patient—asleep, I think?” he said, with an attempt at
28321: cheerfulness in his tone.
28322: 
28323: “He’s gone very deep, sir,” said Mrs. Abel. “He went off gradual
28324: between three and four o’clock. Would you please to go and look at him?
28325: I thought it no harm to leave him. My man’s gone afield, and the little
28326: girl’s seeing to the kettles.”
28327: 
28328: Bulstrode went up. At a glance he knew that Raffles was not in the
28329: sleep which brings revival, but in the sleep which streams deeper and
28330: deeper into the gulf of death.
28331: 
28332: He looked round the room and saw a bottle with some brandy in it, and
28333: the almost empty opium phial. He put the phial out of sight, and
28334: carried the brandy-bottle down-stairs with him, locking it again in the
28335: wine-cooler.
28336: 
28337: While breakfasting he considered whether he should ride to Middlemarch
28338: at once, or wait for Lydgate’s arrival. He decided to wait, and told
28339: Mrs. Abel that she might go about her work—he could watch in the
28340: bed-chamber.
28341: 
28342: As he sat there and beheld the enemy of his peace going irrevocably
28343: into silence, he felt more at rest than he had done for many months.
28344: His conscience was soothed by the enfolding wing of secrecy, which
28345: seemed just then like an angel sent down for his relief. He drew out
28346: his pocket-book to review various memoranda there as to the
28347: arrangements he had projected and partly carried out in the prospect of
28348: quitting Middlemarch, and considered how far he would let them stand or
28349: recall them, now that his absence would be brief. Some economies which
28350: he felt desirable might still find a suitable occasion in his temporary
28351: withdrawal from management, and he hoped still that Mrs. Casaubon would
28352: take a large share in the expenses of the Hospital. In that way the
28353: moments passed, until a change in the stertorous breathing was marked
28354: enough to draw his attention wholly to the bed, and forced him to think
28355: of the departing life, which had once been subservient to his own—which
28356: he had once been glad to find base enough for him to act on as he
28357: would. It was his gladness then which impelled him now to be glad that
28358: the life was at an end.
28359: 
28360: And who could say that the death of Raffles had been hastened? Who knew
28361: what would have saved him?
28362: 
28363: Lydgate arrived at half-past ten, in time to witness the final pause of
28364: the breath. When he entered the room Bulstrode observed a sudden
28365: expression in his face, which was not so much surprise as a recognition
28366: that he had not judged correctly. He stood by the bed in silence for
28367: some time, with his eyes turned on the dying man, but with that subdued
28368: activity of expression which showed that he was carrying on an inward
28369: debate.
28370: 
28371: “When did this change begin?” said he, looking at Bulstrode.
28372: 
28373: “I did not watch by him last night,” said Bulstrode. “I was over-worn,
28374: and left him under Mrs. Abel’s care. She said that he sank into sleep
28375: between three and four o’clock. When I came in before eight he was
28376: nearly in this condition.”
28377: 
28378: Lydgate did not ask another question, but watched in silence until he
28379: said, “It’s all over.”
28380: 
28381: This morning Lydgate was in a state of recovered hope and freedom. He
28382: had set out on his work with all his old animation, and felt himself
28383: strong enough to bear all the deficiencies of his married life. And he
28384: was conscious that Bulstrode had been a benefactor to him. But he was
28385: uneasy about this case. He had not expected it to terminate as it had
28386: done. Yet he hardly knew how to put a question on the subject to
28387: Bulstrode without appearing to insult him; and if he examined the
28388: housekeeper—why, the man was dead. There seemed to be no use in
28389: implying that somebody’s ignorance or imprudence had killed him. And
28390: after all, he himself might be wrong.
28391: 
28392: He and Bulstrode rode back to Middlemarch together, talking of many
28393: things—chiefly cholera and the chances of the Reform Bill in the House
28394: of Lords, and the firm resolve of the political Unions. Nothing was
28395: said about Raffles, except that Bulstrode mentioned the necessity of
28396: having a grave for him in Lowick churchyard, and observed that, so far
28397: as he knew, the poor man had no connections, except Rigg, whom he had
28398: stated to be unfriendly towards him.
28399: 
28400: On returning home Lydgate had a visit from Mr. Farebrother. The Vicar
28401: had not been in the town the day before, but the news that there was an
28402: execution in Lydgate’s house had got to Lowick by the evening, having
28403: been carried by Mr. Spicer, shoemaker and parish-clerk, who had it from
28404: his brother, the respectable bell-hanger in Lowick Gate. Since that
28405: evening when Lydgate had come down from the billiard room with Fred
28406: Vincy, Mr. Farebrother’s thoughts about him had been rather gloomy.
28407: Playing at the Green Dragon once or oftener might have been a trifle in
28408: another man; but in Lydgate it was one of several signs that he was
28409: getting unlike his former self. He was beginning to do things for which
28410: he had formerly even an excessive scorn. Whatever certain
28411: dissatisfactions in marriage, which some silly tinklings of gossip had
28412: given him hints of, might have to do with this change, Mr. Farebrother
28413: felt sure that it was chiefly connected with the debts which were being
28414: more and more distinctly reported, and he began to fear that any notion
28415: of Lydgate’s having resources or friends in the background must be
28416: quite illusory. The rebuff he had met with in his first attempt to win
28417: Lydgate’s confidence, disinclined him to a second; but this news of the
28418: execution being actually in the house, determined the Vicar to overcome
28419: his reluctance.
28420: 
28421: Lydgate had just dismissed a poor patient, in whom he was much
28422: interested, and he came forward to put out his hand—with an open
28423: cheerfulness which surprised Mr. Farebrother. Could this too be a proud
28424: rejection of sympathy and help? Never mind; the sympathy and help
28425: should be offered.
28426: 
28427: “How are you, Lydgate? I came to see you because I had heard something
28428: which made me anxious about you,” said the Vicar, in the tone of a good
28429: brother, only that there was no reproach in it. They were both seated
28430: by this time, and Lydgate answered immediately—
28431: 
28432: “I think I know what you mean. You had heard that there was an
28433: execution in the house?”
28434: 
28435: “Yes; is it true?”
28436: 
28437: “It was true,” said Lydgate, with an air of freedom, as if he did not
28438: mind talking about the affair now. “But the danger is over; the debt is
28439: paid. I am out of my difficulties now: I shall be freed from debts, and
28440: able, I hope, to start afresh on a better plan.”
28441: 
28442: “I am very thankful to hear it,” said the Vicar, falling back in his
28443: chair, and speaking with that low-toned quickness which often follows
28444: the removal of a load. “I like that better than all the news in the
28445: ‘Times.’ I confess I came to you with a heavy heart.”
28446: 
28447: “Thank you for coming,” said Lydgate, cordially. “I can enjoy the
28448: kindness all the more because I am happier. I have certainly been a
28449: good deal crushed. I’m afraid I shall find the bruises still painful
28450: by-and by,” he added, smiling rather sadly; “but just now I can only
28451: feel that the torture-screw is off.”
28452: 
28453: Mr. Farebrother was silent for a moment, and then said earnestly, “My
28454: dear fellow, let me ask you one question. Forgive me if I take a
28455: liberty.”
28456: 
28457: “I don’t believe you will ask anything that ought to offend me.”
28458: 
28459: “Then—this is necessary to set my heart quite at rest—you have not—have
28460: you?—in order to pay your debts, incurred another debt which may harass
28461: you worse hereafter?”
28462: 
28463: “No,” said Lydgate, coloring slightly. “There is no reason why I should
28464: not tell you—since the fact is so—that the person to whom I am indebted
28465: is Bulstrode. He has made me a very handsome advance—a thousand
28466: pounds—and he can afford to wait for repayment.”
28467: 
28468: “Well, that is generous,” said Mr. Farebrother, compelling himself to
28469: approve of the man whom he disliked. His delicate feeling shrank from
28470: dwelling even in his thought on the fact that he had always urged
28471: Lydgate to avoid any personal entanglement with Bulstrode. He added
28472: immediately, “And Bulstrode must naturally feel an interest in your
28473: welfare, after you have worked with him in a way which has probably
28474: reduced your income instead of adding to it. I am glad to think that he
28475: has acted accordingly.”
28476: 
28477: Lydgate felt uncomfortable under these kindly suppositions. They made
28478: more distinct within him the uneasy consciousness which had shown its
28479: first dim stirrings only a few hours before, that Bulstrode’s motives
28480: for his sudden beneficence following close upon the chillest
28481: indifference might be merely selfish. He let the kindly suppositions
28482: pass. He could not tell the history of the loan, but it was more
28483: vividly present with him than ever, as well as the fact which the Vicar
28484: delicately ignored—that this relation of personal indebtedness to
28485: Bulstrode was what he had once been most resolved to avoid.
28486: 
28487: He began, instead of answering, to speak of his projected economies,
28488: and of his having come to look at his life from a different point of
28489: view.
28490: 
28491: “I shall set up a surgery,” he said. “I really think I made a mistaken
28492: effort in that respect. And if Rosamond will not mind, I shall take an
28493: apprentice. I don’t like these things, but if one carries them out
28494: faithfully they are not really lowering. I have had a severe galling to
28495: begin with: that will make the small rubs seem easy.”
28496: 
28497: Poor Lydgate! the “if Rosamond will not mind,” which had fallen from
28498: him involuntarily as part of his thought, was a significant mark of the
28499: yoke he bore. But Mr. Farebrother, whose hopes entered strongly into
28500: the same current with Lydgate’s, and who knew nothing about him that
28501: could now raise a melancholy presentiment, left him with affectionate
28502: congratulation.

28507: CHAPTER LXXI.
28508: 
28509: _Clown_. . . . ’Twas in the Bunch of Grapes, where, indeed,
28510: you have a delight to sit, have you not?
28511: _Froth_. I have so: because it is an open room, and good for winter.
28512: _Clo_. Why, very well then: I hope here be truths.
28513: —_Measure for Measure_.
28514: 
28515: 
28516: Five days after the death of Raffles, Mr. Bambridge was standing at his
28517: leisure under the large archway leading into the yard of the Green
28518: Dragon. He was not fond of solitary contemplation, but he had only just
28519: come out of the house, and any human figure standing at ease under the
28520: archway in the early afternoon was as certain to attract companionship
28521: as a pigeon which has found something worth pecking at. In this case
28522: there was no material object to feed upon, but the eye of reason saw a
28523: probability of mental sustenance in the shape of gossip. Mr. Hopkins,
28524: the meek-mannered draper opposite, was the first to act on this inward
28525: vision, being the more ambitious of a little masculine talk because his
28526: customers were chiefly women. Mr. Bambridge was rather curt to the
28527: draper, feeling that Hopkins was of course glad to talk to _him_, but
28528: that he was not going to waste much of his talk on Hopkins. Soon,
28529: however, there was a small cluster of more important listeners, who
28530: were either deposited from the passers-by, or had sauntered to the spot
28531: expressly to see if there were anything going on at the Green Dragon;
28532: and Mr. Bambridge was finding it worth his while to say many impressive
28533: things about the fine studs he had been seeing and the purchases he had
28534: made on a journey in the north from which he had just returned.
28535: Gentlemen present were assured that when they could show him anything
28536: to cut out a blood mare, a bay, rising four, which was to be seen at
28537: Doncaster if they chose to go and look at it, Mr. Bambridge would
28538: gratify them by being shot “from here to Hereford.” Also, a pair of
28539: blacks which he was going to put into the break recalled vividly to his
28540: mind a pair which he had sold to Faulkner in ’19, for a hundred
28541: guineas, and which Faulkner had sold for a hundred and sixty two months
28542: later—any gent who could disprove this statement being offered the
28543: privilege of calling Mr. Bambridge by a very ugly name until the
28544: exercise made his throat dry.
28545: 
28546: When the discourse was at this point of animation, came up Mr. Frank
28547: Hawley. He was not a man to compromise his dignity by lounging at the
28548: Green Dragon, but happening to pass along the High Street and seeing
28549: Bambridge on the other side, he took some of his long strides across to
28550: ask the horsedealer whether he had found the first-rate gig-horse which
28551: he had engaged to look for. Mr. Hawley was requested to wait until he
28552: had seen a gray selected at Bilkley: if that did not meet his wishes to
28553: a hair, Bambridge did not know a horse when he saw it, which seemed to
28554: be the highest conceivable unlikelihood. Mr. Hawley, standing with his
28555: back to the street, was fixing a time for looking at the gray and
28556: seeing it tried, when a horseman passed slowly by.
28557: 
28558: “Bulstrode!” said two or three voices at once in a low tone, one of
28559: them, which was the draper’s, respectfully prefixing the “Mr.;” but
28560: nobody having more intention in this interjectural naming than if they
28561: had said “the Riverston coach” when that vehicle appeared in the
28562: distance. Mr. Hawley gave a careless glance round at Bulstrode’s back,
28563: but as Bambridge’s eyes followed it he made a sarcastic grimace.
28564: 
28565: “By jingo! that reminds me,” he began, lowering his voice a little, “I
28566: picked up something else at Bilkley besides your gig-horse, Mr. Hawley.
28567: I picked up a fine story about Bulstrode. Do you know how he came by
28568: his fortune? Any gentleman wanting a bit of curious information, I can
28569: give it him free of expense. If everybody got their deserts, Bulstrode
28570: might have had to say his prayers at Botany Bay.”
28571: 
28572: “What do you mean?” said Mr. Hawley, thrusting his hands into his
28573: pockets, and pushing a little forward under the archway. If Bulstrode
28574: should turn out to be a rascal, Frank Hawley had a prophetic soul.
28575: 
28576: “I had it from a party who was an old chum of Bulstrode’s. I’ll tell
28577: you where I first picked him up,” said Bambridge, with a sudden gesture
28578: of his fore-finger. “He was at Larcher’s sale, but I knew nothing of
28579: him then—he slipped through my fingers—was after Bulstrode, no doubt.
28580: He tells me he can tap Bulstrode to any amount, knows all his secrets.
28581: However, he blabbed to me at Bilkley: he takes a stiff glass. Damme if
28582: I think he meant to turn king’s evidence; but he’s that sort of
28583: bragging fellow, the bragging runs over hedge and ditch with him, till
28584: he’d brag of a spavin as if it ’ud fetch money. A man should know when
28585: to pull up.” Mr. Bambridge made this remark with an air of disgust,
28586: satisfied that his own bragging showed a fine sense of the marketable.
28587: 
28588: “What’s the man’s name? Where can he be found?” said Mr. Hawley.
28589: 
28590: “As to where he is to be found, I left him to it at the Saracen’s Head;
28591: but his name is Raffles.”
28592: 
28593: “Raffles!” exclaimed Mr. Hopkins. “I furnished his funeral yesterday.
28594: He was buried at Lowick. Mr. Bulstrode followed him. A very decent
28595: funeral.” There was a strong sensation among the listeners. Mr.
28596: Bambridge gave an ejaculation in which “brimstone” was the mildest
28597: word, and Mr. Hawley, knitting his brows and bending his head forward,
28598: exclaimed, “What?—where did the man die?”
28599: 
28600: “At Stone Court,” said the draper. “The housekeeper said he was a
28601: relation of the master’s. He came there ill on Friday.”
28602: 
28603: “Why, it was on Wednesday I took a glass with him,” interposed
28604: Bambridge.
28605: 
28606: “Did any doctor attend him?” said Mr. Hawley
28607: 
28608: “Yes. Mr. Lydgate. Mr. Bulstrode sat up with him one night. He died the
28609: third morning.”
28610: 
28611: “Go on, Bambridge,” said Mr. Hawley, insistently. “What did this fellow
28612: say about Bulstrode?”
28613: 
28614: The group had already become larger, the town-clerk’s presence being a
28615: guarantee that something worth listening to was going on there; and Mr.
28616: Bambridge delivered his narrative in the hearing of seven. It was
28617: mainly what we know, including the fact about Will Ladislaw, with some
28618: local color and circumstance added: it was what Bulstrode had dreaded
28619: the betrayal of—and hoped to have buried forever with the corpse of
28620: Raffles—it was that haunting ghost of his earlier life which as he rode
28621: past the archway of the Green Dragon he was trusting that Providence
28622: had delivered him from. Yes, Providence. He had not confessed to
28623: himself yet that he had done anything in the way of contrivance to this
28624: end; he had accepted what seemed to have been offered. It was
28625: impossible to prove that he had done anything which hastened the
28626: departure of that man’s soul.
28627: 
28628: But this gossip about Bulstrode spread through Middlemarch like the
28629: smell of fire. Mr. Frank Hawley followed up his information by sending
28630: a clerk whom he could trust to Stone Court on a pretext of inquiring
28631: about hay, but really to gather all that could be learned about Raffles
28632: and his illness from Mrs. Abel. In this way it came to his knowledge
28633: that Mr. Garth had carried the man to Stone Court in his gig; and Mr.
28634: Hawley in consequence took an opportunity of seeing Caleb, calling at
28635: his office to ask whether he had time to undertake an arbitration if it
28636: were required, and then asking him incidentally about Raffles. Caleb
28637: was betrayed into no word injurious to Bulstrode beyond the fact which
28638: he was forced to admit, that he had given up acting for him within the
28639: last week. Mr Hawley drew his inferences, and feeling convinced that
28640: Raffles had told his story to Garth, and that Garth had given up
28641: Bulstrode’s affairs in consequence, said so a few hours later to Mr.
28642: Toller. The statement was passed on until it had quite lost the stamp
28643: of an inference, and was taken as information coming straight from
28644: Garth, so that even a diligent historian might have concluded Caleb to
28645: be the chief publisher of Bulstrode’s misdemeanors.
28646: 
28647: Mr. Hawley was not slow to perceive that there was no handle for the
28648: law either in the revelations made by Raffles or in the circumstances
28649: of his death. He had himself ridden to Lowick village that he might
28650: look at the register and talk over the whole matter with Mr.
28651: Farebrother, who was not more surprised than the lawyer that an ugly
28652: secret should have come to light about Bulstrode, though he had always
28653: had justice enough in him to hinder his antipathy from turning into
28654: conclusions. But while they were talking another combination was
28655: silently going forward in Mr. Farebrother’s mind, which foreshadowed
28656: what was soon to be loudly spoken of in Middlemarch as a necessary
28657: “putting of two and two together.” With the reasons which kept
28658: Bulstrode in dread of Raffles there flashed the thought that the dread
28659: might have something to do with his munificence towards his medical
28660: man; and though he resisted the suggestion that it had been consciously
28661: accepted in any way as a bribe, he had a foreboding that this
28662: complication of things might be of malignant effect on Lydgate’s
28663: reputation. He perceived that Mr. Hawley knew nothing at present of the
28664: sudden relief from debt, and he himself was careful to glide away from
28665: all approaches towards the subject.
28666: 
28667: “Well,” he said, with a deep breath, wanting to wind up the illimitable
28668: discussion of what might have been, though nothing could be legally
28669: proven, “it is a strange story. So our mercurial Ladislaw has a queer
28670: genealogy! A high-spirited young lady and a musical Polish patriot made
28671: a likely enough stock for him to spring from, but I should never have
28672: suspected a grafting of the Jew pawnbroker. However, there’s no knowing
28673: what a mixture will turn out beforehand. Some sorts of dirt serve to
28674: clarify.”
28675: 
28676: “It’s just what I should have expected,” said Mr. Hawley, mounting his
28677: horse. “Any cursed alien blood, Jew, Corsican, or Gypsy.”
28678: 
28679: “I know he’s one of your black sheep, Hawley. But he is really a
28680: disinterested, unworldly fellow,” said Mr. Farebrother, smiling.
28681: 
28682: “Ay, ay, that is your Whiggish twist,” said Mr. Hawley, who had been in
28683: the habit of saying apologetically that Farebrother was such a damned
28684: pleasant good-hearted fellow you would mistake him for a Tory.
28685: 
28686: Mr. Hawley rode home without thinking of Lydgate’s attendance on
28687: Raffles in any other light than as a piece of evidence on the side of
28688: Bulstrode. But the news that Lydgate had all at once become able not
28689: only to get rid of the execution in his house but to pay all his debts
28690: in Middlemarch was spreading fast, gathering round it conjectures and
28691: comments which gave it new body and impetus, and soon filling the ears
28692: of other persons besides Mr. Hawley, who were not slow to see a
28693: significant relation between this sudden command of money and
28694: Bulstrode’s desire to stifle the scandal of Raffles. That the money
28695: came from Bulstrode would infallibly have been guessed even if there
28696: had been no direct evidence of it; for it had beforehand entered into
28697: the gossip about Lydgate’s affairs, that neither his father-in-law nor
28698: his own family would do anything for him, and direct evidence was
28699: furnished not only by a clerk at the Bank, but by innocent Mrs.
28700: Bulstrode herself, who mentioned the loan to Mrs. Plymdale, who
28701: mentioned it to her daughter-in-law of the house of Toller, who
28702: mentioned it generally. The business was felt to be so public and
28703: important that it required dinners to feed it, and many invitations
28704: were just then issued and accepted on the strength of this scandal
28705: concerning Bulstrode and Lydgate; wives, widows, and single ladies took
28706: their work and went out to tea oftener than usual; and all public
28707: conviviality, from the Green Dragon to Dollop’s, gathered a zest which
28708: could not be won from the question whether the Lords would throw out
28709: the Reform Bill.
28710: 
28711: For hardly anybody doubted that some scandalous reason or other was at
28712: the bottom of Bulstrode’s liberality to Lydgate. Mr. Hawley indeed, in
28713: the first instance, invited a select party, including the two
28714: physicians, with Mr Toller and Mr. Wrench, expressly to hold a close
28715: discussion as to the probabilities of Raffles’s illness, reciting to
28716: them all the particulars which had been gathered from Mrs. Abel in
28717: connection with Lydgate’s certificate, that the death was due to
28718: delirium tremens; and the medical gentlemen, who all stood
28719: undisturbedly on the old paths in relation to this disease, declared
28720: that they could see nothing in these particulars which could be
28721: transformed into a positive ground of suspicion. But the moral grounds
28722: of suspicion remained: the strong motives Bulstrode clearly had for
28723: wishing to be rid of Raffles, and the fact that at this critical moment
28724: he had given Lydgate the help which he must for some time have known
28725: the need for; the disposition, moreover, to believe that Bulstrode
28726: would be unscrupulous, and the absence of any indisposition to believe
28727: that Lydgate might be as easily bribed as other haughty-minded men when
28728: they have found themselves in want of money. Even if the money had been
28729: given merely to make him hold his tongue about the scandal of
28730: Bulstrode’s earlier life, the fact threw an odious light on Lydgate,
28731: who had long been sneered at as making himself subservient to the
28732: banker for the sake of working himself into predominance, and
28733: discrediting the elder members of his profession. Hence, in spite of
28734: the negative as to any direct sign of guilt in relation to the death at
28735: Stone Court, Mr. Hawley’s select party broke up with the sense that the
28736: affair had “an ugly look.”
28737: 
28738: But this vague conviction of indeterminable guilt, which was enough to
28739: keep up much head-shaking and biting innuendo even among substantial
28740: professional seniors, had for the general mind all the superior power
28741: of mystery over fact. Everybody liked better to conjecture how the
28742: thing was, than simply to know it; for conjecture soon became more
28743: confident than knowledge, and had a more liberal allowance for the
28744: incompatible. Even the more definite scandal concerning Bulstrode’s
28745: earlier life was, for some minds, melted into the mass of mystery, as
28746: so much lively metal to be poured out in dialogue, and to take such
28747: fantastic shapes as heaven pleased.
28748: 
28749: This was the tone of thought chiefly sanctioned by Mrs. Dollop, the
28750: spirited landlady of the Tankard in Slaughter Lane, who had often to
28751: resist the shallow pragmatism of customers disposed to think that their
28752: reports from the outer world were of equal force with what had “come
28753: up” in her mind. How it had been brought to her she didn’t know, but it
28754: was there before her as if it had been “scored with the chalk on the
28755: chimney-board—” as Bulstrode should say, “his inside was _that black_
28756: as if the hairs of his head knowed the thoughts of his heart, he’d tear
28757: ’em up by the roots.”
28758: 
28759: “That’s odd,” said Mr. Limp, a meditative shoemaker, with weak eyes and
28760: a piping voice. “Why, I read in the ‘Trumpet’ that was what the Duke of
28761: Wellington said when he turned his coat and went over to the Romans.”
28762: 
28763: “Very like,” said Mrs. Dollop. “If one raskill said it, it’s more
28764: reason why another should. But hypo_crite_ as he’s been, and holding
28765: things with that high hand, as there was no parson i’ the country good
28766: enough for him, he was forced to take Old Harry into his counsel, and
28767: Old Harry’s been too many for him.”
28768: 
28769: “Ay, ay, he’s a ’complice you can’t send out o’ the country,” said Mr.
28770: Crabbe, the glazier, who gathered much news and groped among it dimly.
28771: “But by what I can make out, there’s them says Bulstrode was for
28772: running away, for fear o’ being found out, before now.”
28773: 
28774: “He’ll be drove away, whether or no,” said Mr. Dill, the barber, who
28775: had just dropped in. “I shaved Fletcher, Hawley’s clerk, this
28776: morning—he’s got a bad finger—and he says they’re all of one mind to
28777: get rid of Bulstrode. Mr. Thesiger is turned against him, and wants him
28778: out o’ the parish. And there’s gentlemen in this town says they’d as
28779: soon dine with a fellow from the hulks. ‘And a deal sooner I would,’
28780: says Fletcher; ‘for what’s more against one’s stomach than a man coming
28781: and making himself bad company with his religion, and giving out as the
28782: Ten Commandments are not enough for him, and all the while he’s worse
28783: than half the men at the tread-mill?’ Fletcher said so himself.”
28784: 
28785: “It’ll be a bad thing for the town though, if Bulstrode’s money goes
28786: out of it,” said Mr. Limp, quaveringly.
28787: 
28788: “Ah, there’s better folks spend their money worse,” said a firm-voiced
28789: dyer, whose crimson hands looked out of keeping with his good-natured
28790: face.
28791: 
28792: “But he won’t keep his money, by what I can make out,” said the
28793: glazier. “Don’t they say as there’s somebody can strip it off him? By
28794: what I can understan’, they could take every penny off him, if they
28795: went to lawing.”
28796: 
28797: “No such thing!” said the barber, who felt himself a little above his
28798: company at Dollop’s, but liked it none the worse. “Fletcher says it’s
28799: no such thing. He says they might prove over and over again whose child
28800: this young Ladislaw was, and they’d do no more than if they proved I
28801: came out of the Fens—he couldn’t touch a penny.”
28802: 
28803: “Look you there now!” said Mrs. Dollop, indignantly. “I thank the Lord
28804: he took my children to Himself, if that’s all the law can do for the
28805: motherless. Then by that, it’s o’ no use who your father and mother is.
28806: But as to listening to what one lawyer says without asking another—I
28807: wonder at a man o’ your cleverness, Mr. Dill. It’s well known there’s
28808: always two sides, if no more; else who’d go to law, I should like to
28809: know? It’s a poor tale, with all the law as there is up and down, if
28810: it’s no use proving whose child you are. Fletcher may say that if he
28811: likes, but I say, don’t Fletcher _me_!”
28812: 
28813: Mr. Dill affected to laugh in a complimentary way at Mrs. Dollop, as a
28814: woman who was more than a match for the lawyers; being disposed to
28815: submit to much twitting from a landlady who had a long score against
28816: him.
28817: 
28818: “If they come to lawing, and it’s all true as folks say, there’s more
28819: to be looked to nor money,” said the glazier. “There’s this poor
28820: creetur as is dead and gone; by what I can make out, he’d seen the day
28821: when he was a deal finer gentleman nor Bulstrode.”
28822: 
28823: “Finer gentleman! I’ll warrant him,” said Mrs. Dollop; “and a far
28824: personabler man, by what I can hear. As I said when Mr. Baldwin, the
28825: tax-gatherer, comes in, a-standing where you sit, and says, ‘Bulstrode
28826: got all his money as he brought into this town by thieving and
28827: swindling,’—I said, ‘You don’t make me no wiser, Mr. Baldwin: it’s set
28828: my blood a-creeping to look at him ever sin’ here he came into
28829: Slaughter Lane a-wanting to buy the house over my head: folks don’t
28830: look the color o’ the dough-tub and stare at you as if they wanted to
28831: see into your backbone for nothingk.’ That was what I said, and Mr.
28832: Baldwin can bear me witness.”
28833: 
28834: “And in the rights of it too,” said Mr. Crabbe. “For by what I can make
28835: out, this Raffles, as they call him, was a lusty, fresh-colored man as
28836: you’d wish to see, and the best o’ company—though dead he lies in
28837: Lowick churchyard sure enough; and by what I can understan’, there’s
28838: them knows more than they _should_ know about how he got there.”
28839: 
28840: “I’ll believe you!” said Mrs. Dollop, with a touch of scorn at Mr.
28841: Crabbe’s apparent dimness. “When a man’s been ’ticed to a lone house,
28842: and there’s them can pay for hospitals and nurses for half the
28843: country-side choose to be sitters-up night and day, and nobody to come
28844: near but a doctor as is known to stick at nothingk, and as poor as he
28845: can hang together, and after that so flush o’ money as he can pay off
28846: Mr. Byles the butcher as his bill has been running on for the best o’
28847: joints since last Michaelmas was a twelvemonth—I don’t want anybody to
28848: come and tell me as there’s been more going on nor the Prayer-book’s
28849: got a service for—I don’t want to stand winking and blinking and
28850: thinking.”
28851: 
28852: Mrs. Dollop looked round with the air of a landlady accustomed to
28853: dominate her company. There was a chorus of adhesion from the more
28854: courageous; but Mr. Limp, after taking a draught, placed his flat hands
28855: together and pressed them hard between his knees, looking down at them
28856: with blear-eyed contemplation, as if the scorching power of Mrs.
28857: Dollop’s speech had quite dried up and nullified his wits until they
28858: could be brought round again by further moisture.
28859: 
28860: “Why shouldn’t they dig the man up and have the Crowner?” said the
28861: dyer. “It’s been done many and many’s the time. If there’s been foul
28862: play they might find it out.”
28863: 
28864: “Not they, Mr. Jonas!” said Mrs Dollop, emphatically. “I know what
28865: doctors are. They’re a deal too cunning to be found out. And this
28866: Doctor Lydgate that’s been for cutting up everybody before the breath
28867: was well out o’ their body—it’s plain enough what use he wanted to make
28868: o’ looking into respectable people’s insides. He knows drugs, you may
28869: be sure, as you can neither smell nor see, neither before they’re
28870: swallowed nor after. Why, I’ve seen drops myself ordered by Doctor
28871: Gambit, as is our club doctor and a good charikter, and has brought
28872: more live children into the world nor ever another i’ Middlemarch—I say
28873: I’ve seen drops myself as made no difference whether they was in the
28874: glass or out, and yet have griped you the next day. So I’ll leave your
28875: own sense to judge. Don’t tell me! All I say is, it’s a mercy they
28876: didn’t take this Doctor Lydgate on to our club. There’s many a mother’s
28877: child might ha’ rued it.”
28878: 
28879: The heads of this discussion at “Dollop’s” had been the common theme
28880: among all classes in the town, had been carried to Lowick Parsonage on
28881: one side and to Tipton Grange on the other, had come fully to the ears
28882: of the Vincy family, and had been discussed with sad reference to “poor
28883: Harriet” by all Mrs. Bulstrode’s friends, before Lydgate knew
28884: distinctly why people were looking strangely at him, and before
28885: Bulstrode himself suspected the betrayal of his secrets. He had not
28886: been accustomed to very cordial relations with his neighbors, and hence
28887: he could not miss the signs of cordiality; moreover, he had been taking
28888: journeys on business of various kinds, having now made up his mind that
28889: he need not quit Middlemarch, and feeling able consequently to
28890: determine on matters which he had before left in suspense.
28891: 
28892: “We will make a journey to Cheltenham in the course of a month or two,”
28893: he had said to his wife. “There are great spiritual advantages to be
28894: had in that town along with the air and the waters, and six weeks there
28895: will be eminently refreshing to us.”
28896: 
28897: He really believed in the spiritual advantages, and meant that his life
28898: henceforth should be the more devoted because of those later sins which
28899: he represented to himself as hypothetic, praying hypothetically for
28900: their pardon:—“if I have herein transgressed.”
28901: 
28902: As to the Hospital, he avoided saying anything further to Lydgate,
28903: fearing to manifest a too sudden change of plans immediately on the
28904: death of Raffles. In his secret soul he believed that Lydgate suspected
28905: his orders to have been intentionally disobeyed, and suspecting this he
28906: must also suspect a motive. But nothing had been betrayed to him as to
28907: the history of Raffles, and Bulstrode was anxious not to do anything
28908: which would give emphasis to his undefined suspicions. As to any
28909: certainty that a particular method of treatment would either save or
28910: kill, Lydgate himself was constantly arguing against such dogmatism; he
28911: had no right to speak, and he had every motive for being silent. Hence
28912: Bulstrode felt himself providentially secured. The only incident he had
28913: strongly winced under had been an occasional encounter with Caleb
28914: Garth, who, however, had raised his hat with mild gravity.
28915: 
28916: Meanwhile, on the part of the principal townsmen a strong determination
28917: was growing against him.
28918: 
28919: A meeting was to be held in the Town-Hall on a sanitary question which
28920: had risen into pressing importance by the occurrence of a cholera case
28921: in the town. Since the Act of Parliament, which had been hurriedly
28922: passed, authorizing assessments for sanitary measures, there had been a
28923: Board for the superintendence of such measures appointed in
28924: Middlemarch, and much cleansing and preparation had been concurred in
28925: by Whigs and Tories. The question now was, whether a piece of ground
28926: outside the town should be secured as a burial-ground by means of
28927: assessment or by private subscription. The meeting was to be open, and
28928: almost everybody of importance in the town was expected to be there.
28929: 
28930: Mr. Bulstrode was a member of the Board, and just before twelve o’clock
28931: he started from the Bank with the intention of urging the plan of
28932: private subscription. Under the hesitation of his projects, he had for
28933: some time kept himself in the background, and he felt that he should
28934: this morning resume his old position as a man of action and influence
28935: in the public affairs of the town where he expected to end his days.
28936: Among the various persons going in the same direction, he saw Lydgate;
28937: they joined, talked over the object of the meeting, and entered it
28938: together.
28939: 
28940: It seemed that everybody of mark had been earlier than they. But there
28941: were still spaces left near the head of the large central table, and
28942: they made their way thither. Mr. Farebrother sat opposite, not far from
28943: Mr. Hawley; all the medical men were there; Mr. Thesiger was in the
28944: chair, and Mr. Brooke of Tipton was on his right hand.
28945: 
28946: Lydgate noticed a peculiar interchange of glances when he and Bulstrode
28947: took their seats.
28948: 
28949: After the business had been fully opened by the chairman, who pointed
28950: out the advantages of purchasing by subscription a piece of ground
28951: large enough to be ultimately used as a general cemetery, Mr.
28952: Bulstrode, whose rather high-pitched but subdued and fluent voice the
28953: town was used to at meetings of this sort, rose and asked leave to
28954: deliver his opinion. Lydgate could see again the peculiar interchange
28955: of glances before Mr. Hawley started up, and said in his firm resonant
28956: voice, “Mr. Chairman, I request that before any one delivers his
28957: opinion on this point I may be permitted to speak on a question of
28958: public feeling, which not only by myself, but by many gentlemen
28959: present, is regarded as preliminary.”
28960: 
28961: Mr. Hawley’s mode of speech, even when public decorum repressed his
28962: “awful language,” was formidable in its curtness and self-possession.
28963: Mr. Thesiger sanctioned the request, Mr. Bulstrode sat down, and Mr.
28964: Hawley continued.
28965: 
28966: “In what I have to say, Mr. Chairman, I am not speaking simply on my
28967: own behalf: I am speaking with the concurrence and at the express
28968: request of no fewer than eight of my fellow-townsmen, who are
28969: immediately around us. It is our united sentiment that Mr. Bulstrode
28970: should be called upon—and I do now call upon him—to resign public
28971: positions which he holds not simply as a tax-payer, but as a gentleman
28972: among gentlemen. There are practices and there are acts which, owing to
28973: circumstances, the law cannot visit, though they may be worse than many
28974: things which are legally punishable. Honest men and gentlemen, if they
28975: don’t want the company of people who perpetrate such acts, have got to
28976: defend themselves as they best can, and that is what I and the friends
28977: whom I may call my clients in this affair are determined to do. I don’t
28978: say that Mr. Bulstrode has been guilty of shameful acts, but I call
28979: upon him either publicly to deny and confute the scandalous statements
28980: made against him by a man now dead, and who died in his house—the
28981: statement that he was for many years engaged in nefarious practices,
28982: and that he won his fortune by dishonest procedures—or else to withdraw
28983: from positions which could only have been allowed him as a gentleman
28984: among gentlemen.”
28985: 
28986: All eyes in the room were turned on Mr. Bulstrode, who, since the first
28987: mention of his name, had been going through a crisis of feeling almost
28988: too violent for his delicate frame to support. Lydgate, who himself was
28989: undergoing a shock as from the terrible practical interpretation of
28990: some faint augury, felt, nevertheless, that his own movement of
28991: resentful hatred was checked by that instinct of the Healer which
28992: thinks first of bringing rescue or relief to the sufferer, when he
28993: looked at the shrunken misery of Bulstrode’s livid face.
28994: 
28995: The quick vision that his life was after all a failure, that he was a
28996: dishonored man, and must quail before the glance of those towards whom
28997: he had habitually assumed the attitude of a reprover—that God had
28998: disowned him before men and left him unscreened to the triumphant scorn
28999: of those who were glad to have their hatred justified—the sense of
29000: utter futility in that equivocation with his conscience in dealing with
29001: the life of his accomplice, an equivocation which now turned venomously
29002: upon him with the full-grown fang of a discovered lie:—all this rushed
29003: through him like the agony of terror which fails to kill, and leaves
29004: the ears still open to the returning wave of execration. The sudden
29005: sense of exposure after the re-established sense of safety came—not to
29006: the coarse organization of a criminal, but to the susceptible nerve of
29007: a man whose intensest being lay in such mastery and predominance as the
29008: conditions of his life had shaped for him.
29009: 
29010: But in that intense being lay the strength of reaction. Through all his
29011: bodily infirmity there ran a tenacious nerve of ambitious
29012: self-preserving will, which had continually leaped out like a flame,
29013: scattering all doctrinal fears, and which, even while he sat an object
29014: of compassion for the merciful, was beginning to stir and glow under
29015: his ashy paleness. Before the last words were out of Mr. Hawley’s
29016: mouth, Bulstrode felt that he should answer, and that his answer would
29017: be a retort. He dared not get up and say, “I am not guilty, the whole
29018: story is false”—even if he had dared this, it would have seemed to him,
29019: under his present keen sense of betrayal, as vain as to pull, for
29020: covering to his nakedness, a frail rag which would rend at every little
29021: strain.
29022: 
29023: For a few moments there was total silence, while every man in the room
29024: was looking at Bulstrode. He sat perfectly still, leaning hard against
29025: the back of his chair; he could not venture to rise, and when he began
29026: to speak he pressed his hands upon the seat on each side of him. But
29027: his voice was perfectly audible, though hoarser than usual, and his
29028: words were distinctly pronounced, though he paused between sentence as
29029: if short of breath. He said, turning first toward Mr. Thesiger, and
29030: then looking at Mr. Hawley—
29031: 
29032: “I protest before you, sir, as a Christian minister, against the
29033: sanction of proceedings towards me which are dictated by virulent
29034: hatred. Those who are hostile to me are glad to believe any libel
29035: uttered by a loose tongue against me. And their consciences become
29036: strict against me. Say that the evil-speaking of which I am to be made
29037: the victim accuses me of malpractices—” here Bulstrode’s voice rose and
29038: took on a more biting accent, till it seemed a low cry—“who shall be my
29039: accuser? Not men whose own lives are unchristian, nay, scandalous—not
29040: men who themselves use low instruments to carry out their ends—whose
29041: profession is a tissue of chicanery—who have been spending their income
29042: on their own sensual enjoyments, while I have been devoting mine to
29043: advance the best objects with regard to this life and the next.”
29044: 
29045: After the word chicanery there was a growing noise, half of murmurs and
29046: half of hisses, while four persons started up at once—Mr. Hawley, Mr.
29047: Toller, Mr. Chichely, and Mr. Hackbutt; but Mr. Hawley’s outburst was
29048: instantaneous, and left the others behind in silence.
29049: 
29050: “If you mean me, sir, I call you and every one else to the inspection
29051: of my professional life. As to Christian or unchristian, I repudiate
29052: your canting palavering Christianity; and as to the way in which I
29053: spend my income, it is not my principle to maintain thieves and cheat
29054: offspring of their due inheritance in order to support religion and set
29055: myself up as a saintly Killjoy. I affect no niceness of conscience—I
29056: have not found any nice standards necessary yet to measure your actions
29057: by, sir. And I again call upon you to enter into satisfactory
29058: explanations concerning the scandals against you, or else to withdraw
29059: from posts in which we at any rate decline you as a colleague. I say,
29060: sir, we decline to co-operate with a man whose character is not cleared
29061: from infamous lights cast upon it, not only by reports but by recent
29062: actions.”
29063: 
29064: “Allow me, Mr. Hawley,” said the chairman; and Mr. Hawley, still
29065: fuming, bowed half impatiently, and sat down with his hands thrust deep
29066: in his pockets.
29067: 
29068: “Mr. Bulstrode, it is not desirable, I think, to prolong the present
29069: discussion,” said Mr. Thesiger, turning to the pallid trembling man; “I
29070: must so far concur with what has fallen from Mr. Hawley in expression
29071: of a general feeling, as to think it due to your Christian profession
29072: that you should clear yourself, if possible, from unhappy aspersions. I
29073: for my part should be willing to give you full opportunity and hearing.
29074: But I must say that your present attitude is painfully inconsistent
29075: with those principles which you have sought to identify yourself with,
29076: and for the honor of which I am bound to care. I recommend you at
29077: present, as your clergyman, and one who hopes for your reinstatement in
29078: respect, to quit the room, and avoid further hindrance to business.”
29079: 
29080: Bulstrode, after a moment’s hesitation, took his hat from the floor and
29081: slowly rose, but he grasped the corner of the chair so totteringly that
29082: Lydgate felt sure there was not strength enough in him to walk away
29083: without support. What could he do? He could not see a man sink close to
29084: him for want of help. He rose and gave his arm to Bulstrode, and in
29085: that way led him out of the room; yet this act, which might have been
29086: one of gentle duty and pure compassion, was at this moment unspeakably
29087: bitter to him. It seemed as if he were putting his sign-manual to that
29088: association of himself with Bulstrode, of which he now saw the full
29089: meaning as it must have presented itself to other minds. He now felt
29090: the conviction that this man who was leaning tremblingly on his arm,
29091: had given him the thousand pounds as a bribe, and that somehow the
29092: treatment of Raffles had been tampered with from an evil motive. The
29093: inferences were closely linked enough; the town knew of the loan,
29094: believed it to be a bribe, and believed that he took it as a bribe.
29095: 
29096: Poor Lydgate, his mind struggling under the terrible clutch of this
29097: revelation, was all the while morally forced to take Mr. Bulstrode to
29098: the Bank, send a man off for his carriage, and wait to accompany him
29099: home.
29100: 
29101: Meanwhile the business of the meeting was despatched, and fringed off
29102: into eager discussion among various groups concerning this affair of
29103: Bulstrode—and Lydgate.
29104: 
29105: Mr. Brooke, who had before heard only imperfect hints of it, and was
29106: very uneasy that he had “gone a little too far” in countenancing
29107: Bulstrode, now got himself fully informed, and felt some benevolent
29108: sadness in talking to Mr. Farebrother about the ugly light in which
29109: Lydgate had come to be regarded. Mr. Farebrother was going to walk back
29110: to Lowick.
29111: 
29112: “Step into my carriage,” said Mr. Brooke. “I am going round to see Mrs.
29113: Casaubon. She was to come back from Yorkshire last night. She will like
29114: to see me, you know.”
29115: 
29116: So they drove along, Mr. Brooke chatting with good-natured hope that
29117: there had not really been anything black in Lydgate’s behavior—a young
29118: fellow whom he had seen to be quite above the common mark, when he
29119: brought a letter from his uncle Sir Godwin. Mr. Farebrother said
29120: little: he was deeply mournful: with a keen perception of human
29121: weakness, he could not be confident that under the pressure of
29122: humiliating needs Lydgate had not fallen below himself.
29123: 
29124: When the carriage drove up to the gate of the Manor, Dorothea was out
29125: on the gravel, and came to greet them.
29126: 
29127: “Well, my dear,” said Mr. Brooke, “we have just come from a meeting—a
29128: sanitary meeting, you know.”
29129: 
29130: “Was Mr. Lydgate there?” said Dorothea, who looked full of health and
29131: animation, and stood with her head bare under the gleaming April
29132: lights. “I want to see him and have a great consultation with him about
29133: the Hospital. I have engaged with Mr. Bulstrode to do so.”
29134: 
29135: “Oh, my dear,” said Mr. Brooke, “we have been hearing bad news—bad
29136: news, you know.”
29137: 
29138: They walked through the garden towards the churchyard gate, Mr.
29139: Farebrother wanting to go on to the parsonage; and Dorothea heard the
29140: whole sad story.
29141: 
29142: She listened with deep interest, and begged to hear twice over the
29143: facts and impressions concerning Lydgate. After a short silence,
29144: pausing at the churchyard gate, and addressing Mr. Farebrother, she
29145: said energetically—
29146: 
29147: “You don’t believe that Mr. Lydgate is guilty of anything base? I will
29148: not believe it. Let us find out the truth and clear him!”
29149: 
29150: 
29151:

29156: 
29157: 
29158: 
29159: CHAPTER LXXII.
29160: 
29161: Full souls are double mirrors, making still
29162: An endless vista of fair things before,
29163: Repeating things behind.
29164: 
29165: 
29166: Dorothea’s impetuous generosity, which would have leaped at once to the
29167: vindication of Lydgate from the suspicion of having accepted money as a
29168: bribe, underwent a melancholy check when she came to consider all the
29169: circumstances of the case by the light of Mr. Farebrother’s experience.
29170: 
29171: “It is a delicate matter to touch,” he said. “How can we begin to
29172: inquire into it? It must be either publicly by setting the magistrate
29173: and coroner to work, or privately by questioning Lydgate. As to the
29174: first proceeding there is no solid ground to go upon, else Hawley would
29175: have adopted it; and as to opening the subject with Lydgate, I confess
29176: I should shrink from it. He would probably take it as a deadly insult.
29177: I have more than once experienced the difficulty of speaking to him on
29178: personal matters. And—one should know the truth about his conduct
29179: beforehand, to feel very confident of a good result.”
29180: 
29181: “I feel convinced that his conduct has not been guilty: I believe that
29182: people are almost always better than their neighbors think they are,”
29183: said Dorothea. Some of her intensest experience in the last two years
29184: had set her mind strongly in opposition to any unfavorable construction
29185: of others; and for the first time she felt rather discontented with Mr.
29186: Farebrother. She disliked this cautious weighing of consequences,
29187: instead of an ardent faith in efforts of justice and mercy, which would
29188: conquer by their emotional force. Two days afterwards, he was dining at
29189: the Manor with her uncle and the Chettams, and when the dessert was
29190: standing uneaten, the servants were out of the room, and Mr. Brooke was
29191: nodding in a nap, she returned to the subject with renewed vivacity.
29192: 
29193: “Mr. Lydgate would understand that if his friends hear a calumny about
29194: him their first wish must be to justify him. What do we live for, if it
29195: is not to make life less difficult to each other? I cannot be
29196: indifferent to the troubles of a man who advised me in _my_ trouble,
29197: and attended me in my illness.”
29198: 
29199: Dorothea’s tone and manner were not more energetic than they had been
29200: when she was at the head of her uncle’s table nearly three years
29201: before, and her experience since had given her more right to express a
29202: decided opinion. But Sir James Chettam was no longer the diffident and
29203: acquiescent suitor: he was the anxious brother-in-law, with a devout
29204: admiration for his sister, but with a constant alarm lest she should
29205: fall under some new illusion almost as bad as marrying Casaubon. He
29206: smiled much less; when he said “Exactly” it was more often an
29207: introduction to a dissentient opinion than in those submissive bachelor
29208: days; and Dorothea found to her surprise that she had to resolve not to
29209: be afraid of him—all the more because he was really her best friend. He
29210: disagreed with her now.
29211: 
29212: “But, Dorothea,” he said, remonstrantly, “you can’t undertake to manage
29213: a man’s life for him in that way. Lydgate must know—at least he will
29214: soon come to know how he stands. If he can clear himself, he will. He
29215: must act for himself.”
29216: 
29217: “I think his friends must wait till they find an opportunity,” added
29218: Mr. Farebrother. “It is possible—I have often felt so much weakness in
29219: myself that I can conceive even a man of honorable disposition, such as
29220: I have always believed Lydgate to be, succumbing to such a temptation
29221: as that of accepting money which was offered more or less indirectly as
29222: a bribe to insure his silence about scandalous facts long gone by. I
29223: say, I can conceive this, if he were under the pressure of hard
29224: circumstances—if he had been harassed as I feel sure Lydgate has been.
29225: I would not believe anything worse of him except under stringent proof.
29226: But there is the terrible Nemesis following on some errors, that it is
29227: always possible for those who like it to interpret them into a crime:
29228: there is no proof in favor of the man outside his own consciousness and
29229: assertion.”
29230: 
29231: “Oh, how cruel!” said Dorothea, clasping her hands. “And would you not
29232: like to be the one person who believed in that man’s innocence, if the
29233: rest of the world belied him? Besides, there is a man’s character
29234: beforehand to speak for him.”
29235: 
29236: “But, my dear Mrs. Casaubon,” said Mr. Farebrother, smiling gently at
29237: her ardor, “character is not cut in marble—it is not something solid
29238: and unalterable. It is something living and changing, and may become
29239: diseased as our bodies do.”
29240: 
29241: “Then it may be rescued and healed,” said Dorothea “I should not be
29242: afraid of asking Mr. Lydgate to tell me the truth, that I might help
29243: him. Why should I be afraid? Now that I am not to have the land, James,
29244: I might do as Mr. Bulstrode proposed, and take his place in providing
29245: for the Hospital; and I have to consult Mr. Lydgate, to know thoroughly
29246: what are the prospects of doing good by keeping up the present plans.
29247: There is the best opportunity in the world for me to ask for his
29248: confidence; and he would be able to tell me things which might make all
29249: the circumstances clear. Then we would all stand by him and bring him
29250: out of his trouble. People glorify all sorts of bravery except the
29251: bravery they might show on behalf of their nearest neighbors.”
29252: Dorothea’s eyes had a moist brightness in them, and the changed tones
29253: of her voice roused her uncle, who began to listen.
29254: 
29255: “It is true that a woman may venture on some efforts of sympathy which
29256: would hardly succeed if we men undertook them,” said Mr. Farebrother,
29257: almost converted by Dorothea’s ardor.
29258: 
29259: “Surely, a woman is bound to be cautious and listen to those who know
29260: the world better than she does.” said Sir James, with his little frown.
29261: “Whatever you do in the end, Dorothea, you should really keep back at
29262: present, and not volunteer any meddling with this Bulstrode business.
29263: We don’t know yet what may turn up. You must agree with me?” he ended,
29264: looking at Mr. Farebrother.
29265: 
29266: “I do think it would be better to wait,” said the latter.
29267: 
29268: “Yes, yes, my dear,” said Mr. Brooke, not quite knowing at what point
29269: the discussion had arrived, but coming up to it with a contribution
29270: which was generally appropriate. “It is easy to go too far, you know.
29271: You must not let your ideas run away with you. And as to being in a
29272: hurry to put money into schemes—it won’t do, you know. Garth has drawn
29273: me in uncommonly with repairs, draining, that sort of thing: I’m
29274: uncommonly out of pocket with one thing or another. I must pull up. As
29275: for you, Chettam, you are spending a fortune on those oak fences round
29276: your demesne.”
29277: 
29278: Dorothea, submitting uneasily to this discouragement, went with Celia
29279: into the library, which was her usual drawing-room.
29280: 
29281: “Now, Dodo, do listen to what James says,” said Celia, “else you will
29282: be getting into a scrape. You always did, and you always will, when you
29283: set about doing as you please. And I think it is a mercy now after all
29284: that you have got James to think for you. He lets you have your plans,
29285: only he hinders you from being taken in. And that is the good of having
29286: a brother instead of a husband. A husband would not let you have your
29287: plans.”
29288: 
29289: “As if I wanted a husband!” said Dorothea. “I only want not to have my
29290: feelings checked at every turn.” Mrs. Casaubon was still undisciplined
29291: enough to burst into angry tears.
29292: 
29293: “Now, really, Dodo,” said Celia, with rather a deeper guttural than
29294: usual, “you _are_ contradictory: first one thing and then another. You
29295: used to submit to Mr. Casaubon quite shamefully: I think you would have
29296: given up ever coming to see me if he had asked you.”
29297: 
29298: “Of course I submitted to him, because it was my duty; it was my
29299: feeling for him,” said Dorothea, looking through the prism of her
29300: tears.
29301: 
29302: “Then why can’t you think it your duty to submit a little to what James
29303: wishes?” said Celia, with a sense of stringency in her argument.
29304: “Because he only wishes what is for your own good. And, of course, men
29305: know best about everything, except what women know better.” Dorothea
29306: laughed and forgot her tears.
29307: 
29308: “Well, I mean about babies and those things,” explained Celia. “I
29309: should not give up to James when I knew he was wrong, as you used to do
29310: to Mr. Casaubon.”

29316: 
29317: Pity the laden one; this wandering woe
29318: May visit you and me.
29319: 
29320: 
29321: When Lydgate had allayed Mrs. Bulstrode’s anxiety by telling her that
29322: her husband had been seized with faintness at the meeting, but that he
29323: trusted soon to see him better and would call again the next day,
29324: unless she sent for him earlier, he went directly home, got on his
29325: horse, and rode three miles out of the town for the sake of being out
29326: of reach.
29327: 
29328: He felt himself becoming violent and unreasonable as if raging under
29329: the pain of stings: he was ready to curse the day on which he had come
29330: to Middlemarch. Everything that bad happened to him there seemed a mere
29331: preparation for this hateful fatality, which had come as a blight on
29332: his honorable ambition, and must make even people who had only vulgar
29333: standards regard his reputation as irrevocably damaged. In such moments
29334: a man can hardly escape being unloving. Lydgate thought of himself as
29335: the sufferer, and of others as the agents who had injured his lot. He
29336: had meant everything to turn out differently; and others had thrust
29337: themselves into his life and thwarted his purposes. His marriage seemed
29338: an unmitigated calamity; and he was afraid of going to Rosamond before
29339: he had vented himself in this solitary rage, lest the mere sight of her
29340: should exasperate him and make him behave unwarrantably. There are
29341: episodes in most men’s lives in which their highest qualities can only
29342: cast a deterring shadow over the objects that fill their inward vision:
29343: Lydgate’s tenderheartedness was present just then only as a dread lest
29344: he should offend against it, not as an emotion that swayed him to
29345: tenderness. For he was very miserable. Only those who know the
29346: supremacy of the intellectual life—the life which has a seed of
29347: ennobling thought and purpose within it—can understand the grief of one
29348: who falls from that serene activity into the absorbing soul-wasting
29349: struggle with worldly annoyances.
29350: 
29351: How was he to live on without vindicating himself among people who
29352: suspected him of baseness? How could he go silently away from
29353: Middlemarch as if he were retreating before a just condemnation? And
29354: yet how was he to set about vindicating himself?
29355: 
29356: For that scene at the meeting, which he had just witnessed, although it
29357: had told him no particulars, had been enough to make his own situation
29358: thoroughly clear to him. Bulstrode had been in dread of scandalous
29359: disclosures on the part of Raffles. Lydgate could now construct all the
29360: probabilities of the case. “He was afraid of some betrayal in my
29361: hearing: all he wanted was to bind me to him by a strong obligation:
29362: that was why he passed on a sudden from hardness to liberality. And he
29363: may have tampered with the patient—he may have disobeyed my orders. I
29364: fear he did. But whether he did or not, the world believes that he
29365: somehow or other poisoned the man and that I winked at the crime, if I
29366: didn’t help in it. And yet—and yet he may not be guilty of the last
29367: offence; and it is just possible that the change towards me may have
29368: been a genuine relenting—the effect of second thoughts such as he
29369: alleged. What we call the ‘just possible’ is sometimes true and the
29370: thing we find it easier to believe is grossly false. In his last
29371: dealings with this man Bulstrode may have kept his hands pure, in spite
29372: of my suspicion to the contrary.”
29373: 
29374: There was a benumbing cruelty in his position. Even if he renounced
29375: every other consideration than that of justifying himself—if he met
29376: shrugs, cold glances, and avoidance as an accusation, and made a public
29377: statement of all the facts as he knew them, who would be convinced? It
29378: would be playing the part of a fool to offer his own testimony on
29379: behalf of himself, and say, “I did not take the money as a bribe.” The
29380: circumstances would always be stronger than his assertion. And besides,
29381: to come forward and tell everything about himself must include
29382: declarations about Bulstrode which would darken the suspicions of
29383: others against him. He must tell that he had not known of Raffles’s
29384: existence when he first mentioned his pressing need of money to
29385: Bulstrode, and that he took the money innocently as a result of that
29386: communication, not knowing that a new motive for the loan might have
29387: arisen on his being called in to this man. And after all, the suspicion
29388: of Bulstrode’s motives might be unjust.
29389: 
29390: But then came the question whether he should have acted in precisely
29391: the same way if he had not taken the money? Certainly, if Raffles had
29392: continued alive and susceptible of further treatment when he arrived,
29393: and he had then imagined any disobedience to his orders on the part of
29394: Bulstrode, he would have made a strict inquiry, and if his conjecture
29395: had been verified he would have thrown up the case, in spite of his
29396: recent heavy obligation. But if he had not received any money—if
29397: Bulstrode had never revoked his cold recommendation of bankruptcy—would
29398: he, Lydgate, have abstained from all inquiry even on finding the man
29399: dead?—would the shrinking from an insult to Bulstrode—would the
29400: dubiousness of all medical treatment and the argument that his own
29401: treatment would pass for the wrong with most members of his
29402: profession—have had just the same force or significance with him?
29403: 
29404: That was the uneasy corner of Lydgate’s consciousness while he was
29405: reviewing the facts and resisting all reproach. If he had been
29406: independent, this matter of a patient’s treatment and the distinct rule
29407: that he must do or see done that which he believed best for the life
29408: committed to him, would have been the point on which he would have been
29409: the sturdiest. As it was, he had rested in the consideration that
29410: disobedience to his orders, however it might have arisen, could not be
29411: considered a crime, that in the dominant opinion obedience to his
29412: orders was just as likely to be fatal, and that the affair was simply
29413: one of etiquette. Whereas, again and again, in his time of freedom, he
29414: had denounced the perversion of pathological doubt into moral doubt and
29415: had said—“the purest experiment in treatment may still be
29416: conscientious: my business is to take care of life, and to do the best
29417: I can think of for it. Science is properly more scrupulous than dogma.
29418: Dogma gives a charter to mistake, but the very breath of science is a
29419: contest with mistake, and must keep the conscience alive.” Alas! the
29420: scientific conscience had got into the debasing company of money
29421: obligation and selfish respects.
29422: 
29423: “Is there a medical man of them all in Middlemarch who would question
29424: himself as I do?” said poor Lydgate, with a renewed outburst of
29425: rebellion against the oppression of his lot. “And yet they will all
29426: feel warranted in making a wide space between me and them, as if I were
29427: a leper! My practice and my reputation are utterly damned—I can see
29428: that. Even if I could be cleared by valid evidence, it would make
29429: little difference to the blessed world here. I have been set down as
29430: tainted and should be cheapened to them all the same.”
29431: 
29432: Already there had been abundant signs which had hitherto puzzled him,
29433: that just when he had been paying off his debts and getting cheerfully
29434: on his feet, the townsmen were avoiding him or looking strangely at
29435: him, and in two instances it came to his knowledge that patients of his
29436: had called in another practitioner. The reasons were too plain now. The
29437: general black-balling had begun.
29438: 
29439: No wonder that in Lydgate’s energetic nature the sense of a hopeless
29440: misconstruction easily turned into a dogged resistance. The scowl which
29441: occasionally showed itself on his square brow was not a meaningless
29442: accident. Already when he was re-entering the town after that ride
29443: taken in the first hours of stinging pain, he was setting his mind on
29444: remaining in Middlemarch in spite of the worst that could be done
29445: against him. He would not retreat before calumny, as if he submitted to
29446: it. He would face it to the utmost, and no act of his should show that
29447: he was afraid. It belonged to the generosity as well as defiant force
29448: of his nature that he resolved not to shrink from showing to the full
29449: his sense of obligation to Bulstrode. It was true that the association
29450: with this man had been fatal to him—true that if he had had the
29451: thousand pounds still in his hands with all his debts unpaid he would
29452: have returned the money to Bulstrode, and taken beggary rather than the
29453: rescue which had been sullied with the suspicion of a bribe (for,
29454: remember, he was one of the proudest among the sons of
29455: men)—nevertheless, he would not turn away from this crushed
29456: fellow-mortal whose aid he had used, and make a pitiful effort to get
29457: acquittal for himself by howling against another. “I shall do as I
29458: think right, and explain to nobody. They will try to starve me out,
29459: but—” he was going on with an obstinate resolve, but he was getting
29460: near home, and the thought of Rosamond urged itself again into that
29461: chief place from which it had been thrust by the agonized struggles of
29462: wounded honor and pride.
29463: 
29464: How would Rosamond take it all? Here was another weight of chain to
29465: drag, and poor Lydgate was in a bad mood for bearing her dumb mastery.
29466: He had no impulse to tell her the trouble which must soon be common to
29467: them both. He preferred waiting for the incidental disclosure which
29468: events must soon bring about.

29473: CHAPTER LXXIV.
29474: 
29475: “Mercifully grant that we may grow aged together.”
29476: —BOOK OF TOBIT: _Marriage Prayer_.
29477: 
29478: 
29479: In Middlemarch a wife could not long remain ignorant that the town held
29480: a bad opinion of her husband. No feminine intimate might carry her
29481: friendship so far as to make a plain statement to the wife of the
29482: unpleasant fact known or believed about her husband; but when a woman
29483: with her thoughts much at leisure got them suddenly employed on
29484: something grievously disadvantageous to her neighbors, various moral
29485: impulses were called into play which tended to stimulate utterance.
29486: Candor was one. To be candid, in Middlemarch phraseology, meant, to use
29487: an early opportunity of letting your friends know that you did not take
29488: a cheerful view of their capacity, their conduct, or their position;
29489: and a robust candor never waited to be asked for its opinion. Then,
29490: again, there was the love of truth—a wide phrase, but meaning in this
29491: relation, a lively objection to seeing a wife look happier than her
29492: husband’s character warranted, or manifest too much satisfaction in her
29493: lot—the poor thing should have some hint given her that if she knew the
29494: truth she would have less complacency in her bonnet, and in light
29495: dishes for a supper-party. Stronger than all, there was the regard for
29496: a friend’s moral improvement, sometimes called her soul, which was
29497: likely to be benefited by remarks tending to gloom, uttered with the
29498: accompaniment of pensive staring at the furniture and a manner implying
29499: that the speaker would not tell what was on her mind, from regard to
29500: the feelings of her hearer. On the whole, one might say that an ardent
29501: charity was at work setting the virtuous mind to make a neighbor
29502: unhappy for her good.
29503: 
29504: There were hardly any wives in Middlemarch whose matrimonial
29505: misfortunes would in different ways be likely to call forth more of
29506: this moral activity than Rosamond and her aunt Bulstrode. Mrs.
29507: Bulstrode was not an object of dislike, and had never consciously
29508: injured any human being. Men had always thought her a handsome
29509: comfortable woman, and had reckoned it among the signs of Bulstrode’s
29510: hypocrisy that he had chosen a red-blooded Vincy, instead of a ghastly
29511: and melancholy person suited to his low esteem for earthly pleasure.
29512: When the scandal about her husband was disclosed they remarked of
29513: her—“Ah, poor woman! She’s as honest as the day—_she_ never suspected
29514: anything wrong in him, you may depend on it.” Women, who were intimate
29515: with her, talked together much of “poor Harriet,” imagined what her
29516: feelings must be when she came to know everything, and conjectured how
29517: much she had already come to know. There was no spiteful disposition
29518: towards her; rather, there was a busy benevolence anxious to ascertain
29519: what it would be well for her to feel and do under the circumstances,
29520: which of course kept the imagination occupied with her character and
29521: history from the times when she was Harriet Vincy till now. With the
29522: review of Mrs. Bulstrode and her position it was inevitable to
29523: associate Rosamond, whose prospects were under the same blight with her
29524: aunt’s. Rosamond was more severely criticised and less pitied, though
29525: she too, as one of the good old Vincy family who had always been known
29526: in Middlemarch, was regarded as a victim to marriage with an
29527: interloper. The Vincys had their weaknesses, but then they lay on the
29528: surface: there was never anything bad to be “found out” concerning
29529: them. Mrs. Bulstrode was vindicated from any resemblance to her
29530: husband. Harriet’s faults were her own.
29531: 
29532: “She has always been showy,” said Mrs. Hackbutt, making tea for a small
29533: party, “though she has got into the way of putting her religion
29534: forward, to conform to her husband; she has tried to hold her head up
29535: above Middlemarch by making it known that she invites clergymen and
29536: heaven-knows-who from Riverston and those places.”
29537: 
29538: “We can hardly blame her for that,” said Mrs. Sprague; “because few of
29539: the best people in the town cared to associate with Bulstrode, and she
29540: must have somebody to sit down at her table.”
29541: 
29542: “Mr. Thesiger has always countenanced him,” said Mrs. Hackbutt. “I
29543: think he must be sorry now.”
29544: 
29545: “But he was never fond of him in his heart—that every one knows,” said
29546: Mrs. Tom Toller. “Mr. Thesiger never goes into extremes. He keeps to
29547: the truth in what is evangelical. It is only clergymen like Mr. Tyke,
29548: who want to use Dissenting hymn-books and that low kind of religion,
29549: who ever found Bulstrode to their taste.”
29550: 
29551: “I understand, Mr. Tyke is in great distress about him,” said Mrs.
29552: Hackbutt. “And well he may be: they say the Bulstrodes have half kept
29553: the Tyke family.”
29554: 
29555: “And of course it is a discredit to his doctrines,” said Mrs. Sprague,
29556: who was elderly, and old-fashioned in her opinions.
29557: 
29558: “People will not make a boast of being methodistical in Middlemarch for
29559: a good while to come.”
29560: 
29561: “I think we must not set down people’s bad actions to their religion,”
29562: said falcon-faced Mrs. Plymdale, who had been listening hitherto.
29563: 
29564: “Oh, my dear, we are forgetting,” said Mrs. Sprague. “We ought not to
29565: be talking of this before you.”
29566: 
29567: “I am sure I have no reason to be partial,” said Mrs. Plymdale,
29568: coloring. “It’s true Mr. Plymdale has always been on good terms with
29569: Mr. Bulstrode, and Harriet Vincy was my friend long before she married
29570: him. But I have always kept my own opinions and told her where she was
29571: wrong, poor thing. Still, in point of religion, I must say, Mr.
29572: Bulstrode might have done what he has, and worse, and yet have been a
29573: man of no religion. I don’t say that there has not been a little too
29574: much of that—I like moderation myself. But truth is truth. The men
29575: tried at the assizes are not all over-religious, I suppose.”
29576: 
29577: “Well,” said Mrs. Hackbutt, wheeling adroitly, “all I can say is, that
29578: I think she ought to separate from him.”
29579: 
29580: “I can’t say that,” said Mrs. Sprague. “She took him for better or
29581: worse, you know.”
29582: 
29583: “But ‘worse’ can never mean finding out that your husband is fit for
29584: Newgate,” said Mrs. Hackbutt. “Fancy living with such a man! I should
29585: expect to be poisoned.”
29586: 
29587: “Yes, I think myself it is an encouragement to crime if such men are to
29588: be taken care of and waited on by good wives,” said Mrs. Tom Toller.
29589: 
29590: “And a good wife poor Harriet has been,” said Mrs. Plymdale. “She
29591: thinks her husband the first of men. It’s true he has never denied her
29592: anything.”
29593: 
29594: “Well, we shall see what she will do,” said Mrs. Hackbutt. “I suppose
29595: she knows nothing yet, poor creature. I do hope and trust I shall not
29596: see her, for I should be frightened to death lest I should say anything
29597: about her husband. Do you think any hint has reached her?”
29598: 
29599: “I should hardly think so,” said Mrs. Tom Toller. “We hear that _he_ is
29600: ill, and has never stirred out of the house since the meeting on
29601: Thursday; but she was with her girls at church yesterday, and they had
29602: new Tuscan bonnets. Her own had a feather in it. I have never seen that
29603: her religion made any difference in her dress.”
29604: 
29605: “She wears very neat patterns always,” said Mrs. Plymdale, a little
29606: stung. “And that feather I know she got dyed a pale lavender on purpose
29607: to be consistent. I must say it of Harriet that she wishes to do
29608: right.”
29609: 
29610: “As to her knowing what has happened, it can’t be kept from her long,”
29611: said Mrs. Hackbutt. “The Vincys know, for Mr. Vincy was at the meeting.
29612: It will be a great blow to him. There is his daughter as well as his
29613: sister.”
29614: 
29615: “Yes, indeed,” said Mrs. Sprague. “Nobody supposes that Mr. Lydgate can
29616: go on holding up his head in Middlemarch, things look so black about
29617: the thousand pounds he took just at that man’s death. It really makes
29618: one shudder.”
29619: 
29620: “Pride must have a fall,” said Mrs. Hackbutt.
29621: 
29622: “I am not so sorry for Rosamond Vincy that was as I am for her aunt,”
29623: said Mrs. Plymdale. “She needed a lesson.”
29624: 
29625: “I suppose the Bulstrodes will go and live abroad somewhere,” said Mrs.
29626: Sprague. “That is what is generally done when there is anything
29627: disgraceful in a family.”
29628: 
29629: “And a most deadly blow it will be to Harriet,” said Mrs. Plymdale. “If
29630: ever a woman was crushed, she will be. I pity her from my heart. And
29631: with all her faults, few women are better. From a girl she had the
29632: neatest ways, and was always good-hearted, and as open as the day. You
29633: might look into her drawers when you would—always the same. And so she
29634: has brought up Kate and Ellen. You may think how hard it will be for
29635: her to go among foreigners.”
29636: 
29637: “The doctor says that is what he should recommend the Lydgates to do,”
29638: said Mrs. Sprague. “He says Lydgate ought to have kept among the
29639: French.”
29640: 
29641: “That would suit _her_ well enough, I dare say,” said Mrs. Plymdale;
29642: “there is that kind of lightness about her. But she got that from her
29643: mother; she never got it from her aunt Bulstrode, who always gave her
29644: good advice, and to my knowledge would rather have had her marry
29645: elsewhere.”
29646: 
29647: Mrs. Plymdale was in a situation which caused her some complication of
29648: feeling. There had been not only her intimacy with Mrs. Bulstrode, but
29649: also a profitable business relation of the great Plymdale dyeing house
29650: with Mr. Bulstrode, which on the one hand would have inclined her to
29651: desire that the mildest view of his character should be the true one,
29652: but on the other, made her the more afraid of seeming to palliate his
29653: culpability. Again, the late alliance of her family with the Tollers
29654: had brought her in connection with the best circle, which gratified her
29655: in every direction except in the inclination to those serious views
29656: which she believed to be the best in another sense. The sharp little
29657: woman’s conscience was somewhat troubled in the adjustment of these
29658: opposing “bests,” and of her griefs and satisfactions under late
29659: events, which were likely to humble those who needed humbling, but also
29660: to fall heavily on her old friend whose faults she would have preferred
29661: seeing on a background of prosperity.
29662: 
29663: Poor Mrs. Bulstrode, meanwhile, had been no further shaken by the
29664: oncoming tread of calamity than in the busier stirring of that secret
29665: uneasiness which had always been present in her since the last visit of
29666: Raffles to The Shrubs. That the hateful man had come ill to Stone
29667: Court, and that her husband had chosen to remain there and watch over
29668: him, she allowed to be explained by the fact that Raffles had been
29669: employed and aided in earlier-days, and that this made a tie of
29670: benevolence towards him in his degraded helplessness; and she had been
29671: since then innocently cheered by her husband’s more hopeful speech
29672: about his own health and ability to continue his attention to business.
29673: The calm was disturbed when Lydgate had brought him home ill from the
29674: meeting, and in spite of comforting assurances during the next few
29675: days, she cried in private from the conviction that her husband was not
29676: suffering from bodily illness merely, but from something that afflicted
29677: his mind. He would not allow her to read to him, and scarcely to sit
29678: with him, alleging nervous susceptibility to sounds and movements; yet
29679: she suspected that in shutting himself up in his private room he wanted
29680: to be busy with his papers. Something, she felt sure, had happened.
29681: Perhaps it was some great loss of money; and she was kept in the dark.
29682: Not daring to question her husband, she said to Lydgate, on the fifth
29683: day after the meeting, when she had not left home except to go to
29684: church—
29685: 
29686: “Mr. Lydgate, pray be open with me: I like to know the truth. Has
29687: anything happened to Mr. Bulstrode?”
29688: 
29689: “Some little nervous shock,” said Lydgate, evasively. He felt that it
29690: was not for him to make the painful revelation.
29691: 
29692: “But what brought it on?” said Mrs. Bulstrode, looking directly at him
29693: with her large dark eyes.
29694: 
29695: “There is often something poisonous in the air of public rooms,” said
29696: Lydgate. “Strong men can stand it, but it tells on people in proportion
29697: to the delicacy of their systems. It is often impossible to account for
29698: the precise moment of an attack—or rather, to say why the strength
29699: gives way at a particular moment.”
29700: 
29701: Mrs. Bulstrode was not satisfied with this answer. There remained in
29702: her the belief that some calamity had befallen her husband, of which
29703: she was to be kept in ignorance; and it was in her nature strongly to
29704: object to such concealment. She begged leave for her daughters to sit
29705: with their father, and drove into the town to pay some visits,
29706: conjecturing that if anything were known to have gone wrong in Mr.
29707: Bulstrode’s affairs, she should see or hear some sign of it.
29708: 
29709: She called on Mrs. Thesiger, who was not at home, and then drove to
29710: Mrs. Hackbutt’s on the other side of the churchyard. Mrs. Hackbutt saw
29711: her coming from an up-stairs window, and remembering her former alarm
29712: lest she should meet Mrs. Bulstrode, felt almost bound in consistency
29713: to send word that she was not at home; but against that, there was a
29714: sudden strong desire within her for the excitement of an interview in
29715: which she was quite determined not to make the slightest allusion to
29716: what was in her mind.
29717: 
29718: Hence Mrs. Bulstrode was shown into the drawing-room, and Mrs. Hackbutt
29719: went to her, with more tightness of lip and rubbing of her hands than
29720: was usually observable in her, these being precautions adopted against
29721: freedom of speech. She was resolved not to ask how Mr. Bulstrode was.
29722: 
29723: “I have not been anywhere except to church for nearly a week,” said
29724: Mrs. Bulstrode, after a few introductory remarks. “But Mr. Bulstrode
29725: was taken so ill at the meeting on Thursday that I have not liked to
29726: leave the house.”
29727: 
29728: Mrs. Hackbutt rubbed the back of one hand with the palm of the other
29729: held against her chest, and let her eyes ramble over the pattern on the
29730: rug.
29731: 
29732: “Was Mr. Hackbutt at the meeting?” persevered Mrs. Bulstrode.
29733: 
29734: “Yes, he was,” said Mrs. Hackbutt, with the same attitude. “The land is
29735: to be bought by subscription, I believe.”
29736: 
29737: “Let us hope that there will be no more cases of cholera to be buried
29738: in it,” said Mrs. Bulstrode. “It is an awful visitation. But I always
29739: think Middlemarch a very healthy spot. I suppose it is being used to it
29740: from a child; but I never saw the town I should like to live at better,
29741: and especially our end.”
29742: 
29743: “I am sure I should be glad that you always should live at Middlemarch,
29744: Mrs. Bulstrode,” said Mrs. Hackbutt, with a slight sigh. “Still, we
29745: must learn to resign ourselves, wherever our lot may be cast. Though I
29746: am sure there will always be people in this town who will wish you
29747: well.”
29748: 
29749: Mrs. Hackbutt longed to say, “if you take my advice you will part from
29750: your husband,” but it seemed clear to her that the poor woman knew
29751: nothing of the thunder ready to bolt on her head, and she herself could
29752: do no more than prepare her a little. Mrs. Bulstrode felt suddenly
29753: rather chill and trembling: there was evidently something unusual
29754: behind this speech of Mrs. Hackbutt’s; but though she had set out with
29755: the desire to be fully informed, she found herself unable now to pursue
29756: her brave purpose, and turning the conversation by an inquiry about the
29757: young Hackbutts, she soon took her leave saying that she was going to
29758: see Mrs. Plymdale. On her way thither she tried to imagine that there
29759: might have been some unusually warm sparring at the meeting between Mr.
29760: Bulstrode and some of his frequent opponents—perhaps Mr. Hackbutt might
29761: have been one of them. That would account for everything.
29762: 
29763: But when she was in conversation with Mrs. Plymdale that comforting
29764: explanation seemed no longer tenable. “Selina” received her with a
29765: pathetic affectionateness and a disposition to give edifying answers on
29766: the commonest topics, which could hardly have reference to an ordinary
29767: quarrel of which the most important consequence was a perturbation of
29768: Mr. Bulstrode’s health. Beforehand Mrs. Bulstrode had thought that she
29769: would sooner question Mrs. Plymdale than any one else; but she found to
29770: her surprise that an old friend is not always the person whom it is
29771: easiest to make a confidant of: there was the barrier of remembered
29772: communication under other circumstances—there was the dislike of being
29773: pitied and informed by one who had been long wont to allow her the
29774: superiority. For certain words of mysterious appropriateness that Mrs.
29775: Plymdale let fall about her resolution never to turn her back on her
29776: friends, convinced Mrs. Bulstrode that what had happened must be some
29777: kind of misfortune, and instead of being able to say with her native
29778: directness, “What is it that you have in your mind?” she found herself
29779: anxious to get away before she had heard anything more explicit. She
29780: began to have an agitating certainty that the misfortune was something
29781: more than the mere loss of money, being keenly sensitive to the fact
29782: that Selina now, just as Mrs. Hackbutt had done before, avoided
29783: noticing what she said about her husband, as they would have avoided
29784: noticing a personal blemish.
29785: 
29786: She said good-by with nervous haste, and told the coachman to drive to
29787: Mr. Vincy’s warehouse. In that short drive her dread gathered so much
29788: force from the sense of darkness, that when she entered the private
29789: counting-house where her brother sat at his desk, her knees trembled
29790: and her usually florid face was deathly pale. Something of the same
29791: effect was produced in him by the sight of her: he rose from his seat
29792: to meet her, took her by the hand, and said, with his impulsive
29793: rashness—
29794: 
29795: “God help you, Harriet! you know all.”
29796: 
29797: That moment was perhaps worse than any which came after. It contained
29798: that concentrated experience which in great crises of emotion reveals
29799: the bias of a nature, and is prophetic of the ultimate act which will
29800: end an intermediate struggle. Without that memory of Raffles she might
29801: still have thought only of monetary ruin, but now along with her
29802: brother’s look and words there darted into her mind the idea of some
29803: guilt in her husband—then, under the working of terror came the image
29804: of her husband exposed to disgrace—and then, after an instant of
29805: scorching shame in which she felt only the eyes of the world, with one
29806: leap of her heart she was at his side in mournful but unreproaching
29807: fellowship with shame and isolation. All this went on within her in a
29808: mere flash of time—while she sank into the chair, and raised her eyes
29809: to her brother, who stood over her. “I know nothing, Walter. What is
29810: it?” she said, faintly.
29811: 
29812: He told her everything, very inartificially, in slow fragments, making
29813: her aware that the scandal went much beyond proof, especially as to the
29814: end of Raffles.
29815: 
29816: “People will talk,” he said. “Even if a man has been acquitted by a
29817: jury, they’ll talk, and nod and wink—and as far as the world goes, a
29818: man might often as well be guilty as not. It’s a breakdown blow, and it
29819: damages Lydgate as much as Bulstrode. I don’t pretend to say what is
29820: the truth. I only wish we had never heard the name of either Bulstrode
29821: or Lydgate. You’d better have been a Vincy all your life, and so had
29822: Rosamond.” Mrs. Bulstrode made no reply.
29823: 
29824: “But you must bear up as well as you can, Harriet. People don’t blame
29825: _you_. And I’ll stand by you whatever you make up your mind to do,”
29826: said the brother, with rough but well-meaning affectionateness.
29827: 
29828: “Give me your arm to the carriage, Walter,” said Mrs. Bulstrode. “I
29829: feel very weak.”
29830: 
29831: And when she got home she was obliged to say to her daughter, “I am not
29832: well, my dear; I must go and lie down. Attend to your papa. Leave me in
29833: quiet. I shall take no dinner.”
29834: 
29835: She locked herself in her room. She needed time to get used to her
29836: maimed consciousness, her poor lopped life, before she could walk
29837: steadily to the place allotted her. A new searching light had fallen on
29838: her husband’s character, and she could not judge him leniently: the
29839: twenty years in which she had believed in him and venerated him by
29840: virtue of his concealments came back with particulars that made them
29841: seem an odious deceit. He had married her with that bad past life
29842: hidden behind him, and she had no faith left to protest his innocence
29843: of the worst that was imputed to him. Her honest ostentatious nature
29844: made the sharing of a merited dishonor as bitter as it could be to any
29845: mortal.
29846: 
29847: But this imperfectly taught woman, whose phrases and habits were an odd
29848: patchwork, had a loyal spirit within her. The man whose prosperity she
29849: had shared through nearly half a life, and who had unvaryingly
29850: cherished her—now that punishment had befallen him it was not possible
29851: to her in any sense to forsake him. There is a forsaking which still
29852: sits at the same board and lies on the same couch with the forsaken
29853: soul, withering it the more by unloving proximity. She knew, when she
29854: locked her door, that she should unlock it ready to go down to her
29855: unhappy husband and espouse his sorrow, and say of his guilt, I will
29856: mourn and not reproach. But she needed time to gather up her strength;
29857: she needed to sob out her farewell to all the gladness and pride of her
29858: life. When she had resolved to go down, she prepared herself by some
29859: little acts which might seem mere folly to a hard onlooker; they were
29860: her way of expressing to all spectators visible or invisible that she
29861: had begun a new life in which she embraced humiliation. She took off
29862: all her ornaments and put on a plain black gown, and instead of wearing
29863: her much-adorned cap and large bows of hair, she brushed her hair down
29864: and put on a plain bonnet-cap, which made her look suddenly like an
29865: early Methodist.
29866: 
29867: Bulstrode, who knew that his wife had been out and had come in saying
29868: that she was not well, had spent the time in an agitation equal to
29869: hers. He had looked forward to her learning the truth from others, and
29870: had acquiesced in that probability, as something easier to him than any
29871: confession. But now that he imagined the moment of her knowledge come,
29872: he awaited the result in anguish. His daughters had been obliged to
29873: consent to leave him, and though he had allowed some food to be brought
29874: to him, he had not touched it. He felt himself perishing slowly in
29875: unpitied misery. Perhaps he should never see his wife’s face with
29876: affection in it again. And if he turned to God there seemed to be no
29877: answer but the pressure of retribution.
29878: 
29879: It was eight o’clock in the evening before the door opened and his wife
29880: entered. He dared not look up at her. He sat with his eyes bent down,
29881: and as she went towards him she thought he looked smaller—he seemed so
29882: withered and shrunken. A movement of new compassion and old tenderness
29883: went through her like a great wave, and putting one hand on his which
29884: rested on the arm of the chair, and the other on his shoulder, she
29885: said, solemnly but kindly—
29886: 
29887: “Look up, Nicholas.”
29888: 
29889: He raised his eyes with a little start and looked at her half amazed
29890: for a moment: her pale face, her changed, mourning dress, the trembling
29891: about her mouth, all said, “I know;” and her hands and eyes rested
29892: gently on him. He burst out crying and they cried together, she sitting
29893: at his side. They could not yet speak to each other of the shame which
29894: she was bearing with him, or of the acts which had brought it down on
29895: them. His confession was silent, and her promise of faithfulness was
29896: silent. Open-minded as she was, she nevertheless shrank from the words
29897: which would have expressed their mutual consciousness, as she would
29898: have shrunk from flakes of fire. She could not say, “How much is only
29899: slander and false suspicion?” and he did not say, “I am innocent.”
29900: 
29901: 
29902: 
29903: 
29904: CHAPTER LXXV.
29905: 
29906: “Le sentiment de la fausseté des plaisirs présents, et l’ignorance de
29907: la vanité des plaisirs absents causent l’inconstance.”—PASCAL.
29908: 
29909: 
29910: Rosamond had a gleam of returning cheerfulness when the house was freed
29911: from the threatening figure, and when all the disagreeable creditors
29912: were paid. But she was not joyous: her married life had fulfilled none
29913: of her hopes, and had been quite spoiled for her imagination. In this
29914: brief interval of calm, Lydgate, remembering that he had often been
29915: stormy in his hours of perturbation, and mindful of the pain Rosamond
29916: had had to bear, was carefully gentle towards her; but he, too, had
29917: lost some of his old spirit, and he still felt it necessary to refer to
29918: an economical change in their way of living as a matter of course,
29919: trying to reconcile her to it gradually, and repressing his anger when
29920: she answered by wishing that he would go to live in London. When she
29921: did not make this answer, she listened languidly, and wondered what she
29922: had that was worth living for. The hard and contemptuous words which
29923: had fallen from her husband in his anger had deeply offended that
29924: vanity which he had at first called into active enjoyment; and what she
29925: regarded as his perverse way of looking at things, kept up a secret
29926: repulsion, which made her receive all his tenderness as a poor
29927: substitute for the happiness he had failed to give her. They were at a
29928: disadvantage with their neighbors, and there was no longer any outlook
29929: towards Quallingham—there was no outlook anywhere except in an
29930: occasional letter from Will Ladislaw. She had felt stung and
29931: disappointed by Will’s resolution to quit Middlemarch, for in spite of
29932: what she knew and guessed about his admiration for Dorothea, she
29933: secretly cherished the belief that he had, or would necessarily come to
29934: have, much more admiration for herself; Rosamond being one of those
29935: women who live much in the idea that each man they meet would have
29936: preferred them if the preference had not been hopeless. Mrs. Casaubon
29937: was all very well; but Will’s interest in her dated before he knew Mrs.
29938: Lydgate. Rosamond took his way of talking to herself, which was a
29939: mixture of playful fault-finding and hyperbolical gallantry, as the
29940: disguise of a deeper feeling; and in his presence she felt that
29941: agreeable titillation of vanity and sense of romantic drama which
29942: Lydgate’s presence had no longer the magic to create. She even
29943: fancied—what will not men and women fancy in these matters?—that Will
29944: exaggerated his admiration for Mrs. Casaubon in order to pique herself.
29945: In this way poor Rosamond’s brain had been busy before Will’s
29946: departure. He would have made, she thought, a much more suitable
29947: husband for her than she had found in Lydgate. No notion could have
29948: been falser than this, for Rosamond’s discontent in her marriage was
29949: due to the conditions of marriage itself, to its demand for
29950: self-suppression and tolerance, and not to the nature of her husband;
29951: but the easy conception of an unreal Better had a sentimental charm
29952: which diverted her ennui. She constructed a little romance which was to
29953: vary the flatness of her life: Will Ladislaw was always to be a
29954: bachelor and live near her, always to be at her command, and have an
29955: understood though never fully expressed passion for her, which would be
29956: sending out lambent flames every now and then in interesting scenes.
29957: His departure had been a proportionate disappointment, and had sadly
29958: increased her weariness of Middlemarch; but at first she had the
29959: alternative dream of pleasures in store from her intercourse with the
29960: family at Quallingham. Since then the troubles of her married life had
29961: deepened, and the absence of other relief encouraged her regretful
29962: rumination over that thin romance which she had once fed on. Men and
29963: women make sad mistakes about their own symptoms, taking their vague
29964: uneasy longings, sometimes for genius, sometimes for religion, and
29965: oftener still for a mighty love. Will Ladislaw had written chatty
29966: letters, half to her and half to Lydgate, and she had replied: their
29967: separation, she felt, was not likely to be final, and the change she
29968: now most longed for was that Lydgate should go to live in London;
29969: everything would be agreeable in London; and she had set to work with
29970: quiet determination to win this result, when there came a sudden,
29971: delightful promise which inspirited her.
29972: 
29973: It came shortly before the memorable meeting at the town-hall, and was
29974: nothing less than a letter from Will Ladislaw to Lydgate, which turned
29975: indeed chiefly on his new interest in plans of colonization, but
29976: mentioned incidentally, that he might find it necessary to pay a visit
29977: to Middlemarch within the next few weeks—a very pleasant necessity, he
29978: said, almost as good as holidays to a schoolboy. He hoped there was his
29979: old place on the rug, and a great deal of music in store for him. But
29980: he was quite uncertain as to the time. While Lydgate was reading the
29981: letter to Rosamond, her face looked like a reviving flower—it grew
29982: prettier and more blooming. There was nothing unendurable now: the
29983: debts were paid, Mr. Ladislaw was coming, and Lydgate would be
29984: persuaded to leave Middlemarch and settle in London, which was “so
29985: different from a provincial town.”
29986: 
29987: That was a bright bit of morning. But soon the sky became black over
29988: poor Rosamond. The presence of a new gloom in her husband, about which
29989: he was entirely reserved towards her—for he dreaded to expose his
29990: lacerated feeling to her neutrality and misconception—soon received a
29991: painfully strange explanation, alien to all her previous notions of
29992: what could affect her happiness. In the new gayety of her spirits,
29993: thinking that Lydgate had merely a worse fit of moodiness than usual,
29994: causing him to leave her remarks unanswered, and evidently to keep out
29995: of her way as much as possible, she chose, a few days after the
29996: meeting, and without speaking to him on the subject, to send out notes
29997: of invitation for a small evening party, feeling convinced that this
29998: was a judicious step, since people seemed to have been keeping aloof
29999: from them, and wanted restoring to the old habit of intercourse. When
30000: the invitations had been accepted, she would tell Lydgate, and give him
30001: a wise admonition as to how a medical man should behave to his
30002: neighbors; for Rosamond had the gravest little airs possible about
30003: other people’s duties. But all the invitations were declined, and the
30004: last answer came into Lydgate’s hands.
30005: 
30006: “This is Chichely’s scratch. What is he writing to you about?” said
30007: Lydgate, wonderingly, as he handed the note to her. She was obliged to
30008: let him see it, and, looking at her severely, he said—
30009: 
30010: “Why on earth have you been sending out invitations without telling me,
30011: Rosamond? I beg, I insist that you will not invite any one to this
30012: house. I suppose you have been inviting others, and they have refused
30013: too.” She said nothing.
30014: 
30015: “Do you hear me?” thundered Lydgate.
30016: 
30017: “Yes, certainly I hear you,” said Rosamond, turning her head aside with
30018: the movement of a graceful long-necked bird.
30019: 
30020: Lydgate tossed his head without any grace and walked out of the room,
30021: feeling himself dangerous. Rosamond’s thought was, that he was getting
30022: more and more unbearable—not that there was any new special reason for
30023: this peremptoriness. His indisposition to tell her anything in which he
30024: was sure beforehand that she would not be interested was growing into
30025: an unreflecting habit, and she was in ignorance of everything connected
30026: with the thousand pounds except that the loan had come from her uncle
30027: Bulstrode. Lydgate’s odious humors and their neighbors’ apparent
30028: avoidance of them had an unaccountable date for her in their relief
30029: from money difficulties. If the invitations had been accepted she would
30030: have gone to invite her mamma and the rest, whom she had seen nothing
30031: of for several days; and she now put on her bonnet to go and inquire
30032: what had become of them all, suddenly feeling as if there were a
30033: conspiracy to leave her in isolation with a husband disposed to offend
30034: everybody. It was after the dinner hour, and she found her father and
30035: mother seated together alone in the drawing-room. They greeted her with
30036: sad looks, saying “Well, my dear!” and no more. She had never seen her
30037: father look so downcast; and seating herself near him she said—
30038: 
30039: “Is there anything the matter, papa?”
30040: 
30041: He did not answer, but Mrs. Vincy said, “Oh, my dear, have you heard
30042: nothing? It won’t be long before it reaches you.”
30043: 
30044: “Is it anything about Tertius?” said Rosamond, turning pale. The idea
30045: of trouble immediately connected itself with what had been
30046: unaccountable to her in him.
30047: 
30048: “Oh, my dear, yes. To think of your marrying into this trouble. Debt
30049: was bad enough, but this will be worse.”
30050: 
30051: “Stay, stay, Lucy,” said Mr. Vincy. “Have you heard nothing about your
30052: uncle Bulstrode, Rosamond?”
30053: 
30054: “No, papa,” said the poor thing, feeling as if trouble were not
30055: anything she had before experienced, but some invisible power with an
30056: iron grasp that made her soul faint within her.
30057: 
30058: Her father told her everything, saying at the end, “It’s better for you
30059: to know, my dear. I think Lydgate must leave the town. Things have gone
30060: against him. I dare say he couldn’t help it. I don’t accuse him of any
30061: harm,” said Mr. Vincy. He had always before been disposed to find the
30062: utmost fault with Lydgate.
30063: 
30064: The shock to Rosamond was terrible. It seemed to her that no lot could
30065: be so cruelly hard as hers to have married a man who had become the
30066: centre of infamous suspicions. In many cases it is inevitable that the
30067: shame is felt to be the worst part of crime; and it would have required
30068: a great deal of disentangling reflection, such as had never entered
30069: into Rosamond’s life, for her in these moments to feel that her trouble
30070: was less than if her husband had been certainly known to have done
30071: something criminal. All the shame seemed to be there. And she had
30072: innocently married this man with the belief that he and his family were
30073: a glory to her! She showed her usual reticence to her parents, and only
30074: said, that if Lydgate had done as she wished he would have left
30075: Middlemarch long ago.
30076: 
30077: “She bears it beyond anything,” said her mother when she was gone.
30078: 
30079: “Ah, thank God!” said Mr. Vincy, who was much broken down.
30080: 
30081: But Rosamond went home with a sense of justified repugnance towards her
30082: husband. What had he really done—how had he really acted? She did not
30083: know. Why had he not told her everything? He did not speak to her on
30084: the subject, and of course she could not speak to him. It came into her
30085: mind once that she would ask her father to let her go home again; but
30086: dwelling on that prospect made it seem utter dreariness to her: a
30087: married woman gone back to live with her parents—life seemed to have no
30088: meaning for her in such a position: she could not contemplate herself
30089: in it.
30090: 
30091: The next two days Lydgate observed a change in her, and believed that
30092: she had heard the bad news. Would she speak to him about it, or would
30093: she go on forever in the silence which seemed to imply that she
30094: believed him guilty? We must remember that he was in a morbid state of
30095: mind, in which almost all contact was pain. Certainly Rosamond in this
30096: case had equal reason to complain of reserve and want of confidence on
30097: his part; but in the bitterness of his soul he excused himself;—was he
30098: not justified in shrinking from the task of telling her, since now she
30099: knew the truth she had no impulse to speak to him? But a deeper-lying
30100: consciousness that he was in fault made him restless, and the silence
30101: between them became intolerable to him; it was as if they were both
30102: adrift on one piece of wreck and looked away from each other.
30103: 
30104: He thought, “I am a fool. Haven’t I given up expecting anything? I have
30105: married care, not help.” And that evening he said—
30106: 
30107: “Rosamond, have you heard anything that distresses you?”
30108: 
30109: “Yes,” she answered, laying down her work, which she had been carrying
30110: on with a languid semi-consciousness, most unlike her usual self.
30111: 
30112: “What have you heard?”
30113: 
30114: “Everything, I suppose. Papa told me.”
30115: 
30116: “That people think me disgraced?”
30117: 
30118: “Yes,” said Rosamond, faintly, beginning to sew again automatically.
30119: 
30120: There was silence. Lydgate thought, “If she has any trust in me—any
30121: notion of what I am, she ought to speak now and say that she does not
30122: believe I have deserved disgrace.”
30123: 
30124: But Rosamond on her side went on moving her fingers languidly. Whatever
30125: was to be said on the subject she expected to come from Tertius. What
30126: did she know? And if he were innocent of any wrong, why did he not do
30127: something to clear himself?
30128: 
30129: This silence of hers brought a new rush of gall to that bitter mood in
30130: which Lydgate had been saying to himself that nobody believed in
30131: him—even Farebrother had not come forward. He had begun to question her
30132: with the intent that their conversation should disperse the chill fog
30133: which had gathered between them, but he felt his resolution checked by
30134: despairing resentment. Even this trouble, like the rest, she seemed to
30135: regard as if it were hers alone. He was always to her a being apart,
30136: doing what she objected to. He started from his chair with an angry
30137: impulse, and thrusting his hands in his pockets, walked up and down the
30138: room. There was an underlying consciousness all the while that he
30139: should have to master this anger, and tell her everything, and convince
30140: her of the facts. For he had almost learned the lesson that he must
30141: bend himself to her nature, and that because she came short in her
30142: sympathy, he must give the more. Soon he recurred to his intention of
30143: opening himself: the occasion must not be lost. If he could bring her
30144: to feel with some solemnity that here was a slander which must be met
30145: and not run away from, and that the whole trouble had come out of his
30146: desperate want of money, it would be a moment for urging powerfully on
30147: her that they should be one in the resolve to do with as little money
30148: as possible, so that they might weather the bad time and keep
30149: themselves independent. He would mention the definite measures which he
30150: desired to take, and win her to a willing spirit. He was bound to try
30151: this—and what else was there for him to do?
30152: 
30153: He did not know how long he had been walking uneasily backwards and
30154: forwards, but Rosamond felt that it was long, and wished that he would
30155: sit down. She too had begun to think this an opportunity for urging on
30156: Tertius what he ought to do. Whatever might be the truth about all this
30157: misery, there was one dread which asserted itself.
30158: 
30159: Lydgate at last seated himself, not in his usual chair, but in one
30160: nearer to Rosamond, leaning aside in it towards her, and looking at her
30161: gravely before he reopened the sad subject. He had conquered himself so
30162: far, and was about to speak with a sense of solemnity, as on an
30163: occasion which was not to be repeated. He had even opened his lips,
30164: when Rosamond, letting her hands fall, looked at him and said—
30165: 
30166: “Surely, Tertius—”
30167: 
30168: “Well?”
30169: 
30170: “Surely now at last you have given up the idea of staying in
30171: Middlemarch. I cannot go on living here. Let us go to London. Papa, and
30172: every one else, says you had better go. Whatever misery I have to put
30173: up with, it will be easier away from here.”
30174: 
30175: Lydgate felt miserably jarred. Instead of that critical outpouring for
30176: which he had prepared himself with effort, here was the old round to be
30177: gone through again. He could not bear it. With a quick change of
30178: countenance he rose and went out of the room.
30179: 
30180: Perhaps if he had been strong enough to persist in his determination to
30181: be the more because she was less, that evening might have had a better
30182: issue. If his energy could have borne down that check, he might still
30183: have wrought on Rosamond’s vision and will. We cannot be sure that any
30184: natures, however inflexible or peculiar, will resist this effect from a
30185: more massive being than their own. They may be taken by storm and for
30186: the moment converted, becoming part of the soul which enwraps them in
30187: the ardor of its movement. But poor Lydgate had a throbbing pain within
30188: him, and his energy had fallen short of its task.
30189: 
30190: The beginning of mutual understanding and resolve seemed as far off as
30191: ever; nay, it seemed blocked out by the sense of unsuccessful effort.
30192: They lived on from day to day with their thoughts still apart, Lydgate
30193: going about what work he had in a mood of despair, and Rosamond
30194: feeling, with some justification, that he was behaving cruelly. It was
30195: of no use to say anything to Tertius; but when Will Ladislaw came, she
30196: was determined to tell him everything. In spite of her general
30197: reticence, she needed some one who would recognize her wrongs.

30213: —WILLIAM BLAKE: _Songs of Innocence_.
30214: 
30215: 
30216: Some days later, Lydgate was riding to Lowick Manor, in consequence of
30217: a summons from Dorothea. The summons had not been unexpected, since it
30218: had followed a letter from Mr. Bulstrode, in which he stated that he
30219: had resumed his arrangements for quitting Middlemarch, and must remind
30220: Lydgate of his previous communications about the Hospital, to the
30221: purport of which he still adhered. It had been his duty, before taking
30222: further steps, to reopen the subject with Mrs. Casaubon, who now
30223: wished, as before, to discuss the question with Lydgate. “Your views
30224: may possibly have undergone some change,” wrote Mr. Bulstrode; “but, in
30225: that case also, it is desirable that you should lay them before her.”
30226: 
30227: Dorothea awaited his arrival with eager interest. Though, in deference
30228: to her masculine advisers, she had refrained from what Sir James had
30229: called “interfering in this Bulstrode business,” the hardship of
30230: Lydgate’s position was continually in her mind, and when Bulstrode
30231: applied to her again about the hospital, she felt that the opportunity
30232: was come to her which she had been hindered from hastening. In her
30233: luxurious home, wandering under the boughs of her own great trees, her
30234: thought was going out over the lot of others, and her emotions were
30235: imprisoned. The idea of some active good within her reach, “haunted her
30236: like a passion,” and another’s need having once come to her as a
30237: distinct image, preoccupied her desire with the yearning to give
30238: relief, and made her own ease tasteless. She was full of confident hope
30239: about this interview with Lydgate, never heeding what was said of his
30240: personal reserve; never heeding that she was a very young woman.
30241: Nothing could have seemed more irrelevant to Dorothea than insistence
30242: on her youth and sex when she was moved to show her human fellowship.
30243: 
30244: As she sat waiting in the library, she could do nothing but live
30245: through again all the past scenes which had brought Lydgate into her
30246: memories. They all owed their significance to her marriage and its
30247: troubles—but no; there were two occasions in which the image of Lydgate
30248: had come painfully in connection with his wife and some one else. The
30249: pain had been allayed for Dorothea, but it had left in her an awakened
30250: conjecture as to what Lydgate’s marriage might be to him, a
30251: susceptibility to the slightest hint about Mrs. Lydgate. These thoughts
30252: were like a drama to her, and made her eyes bright, and gave an
30253: attitude of suspense to her whole frame, though she was only looking
30254: out from the brown library on to the turf and the bright green buds
30255: which stood in relief against the dark evergreens.
30256: 
30257: When Lydgate came in, she was almost shocked at the change in his face,
30258: which was strikingly perceptible to her who had not seen him for two
30259: months. It was not the change of emaciation, but that effect which even
30260: young faces will very soon show from the persistent presence of
30261: resentment and despondency. Her cordial look, when she put out her hand
30262: to him, softened his expression, but only with melancholy.
30263: 
30264: “I have wished very much to see you for a long while, Mr. Lydgate,”
30265: said Dorothea when they were seated opposite each other; “but I put off
30266: asking you to come until Mr. Bulstrode applied to me again about the
30267: Hospital. I know that the advantage of keeping the management of it
30268: separate from that of the Infirmary depends on you, or, at least, on
30269: the good which you are encouraged to hope for from having it under your
30270: control. And I am sure you will not refuse to tell me exactly what you
30271: think.”
30272: 
30273: “You want to decide whether you should give a generous support to the
30274: Hospital,” said Lydgate. “I cannot conscientiously advise you to do it
30275: in dependence on any activity of mine. I may be obliged to leave the
30276: town.”
30277: 
30278: He spoke curtly, feeling the ache of despair as to his being able to
30279: carry out any purpose that Rosamond had set her mind against.
30280: 
30281: “Not because there is no one to believe in you?” said Dorothea, pouring
30282: out her words in clearness from a full heart. “I know the unhappy
30283: mistakes about you. I knew them from the first moment to be mistakes.
30284: You have never done anything vile. You would not do anything
30285: dishonorable.”
30286: 
30287: It was the first assurance of belief in him that had fallen on
30288: Lydgate’s ears. He drew a deep breath, and said, “Thank you.” He could
30289: say no more: it was something very new and strange in his life that
30290: these few words of trust from a woman should be so much to him.
30291: 
30292: “I beseech you to tell me how everything was,” said Dorothea,
30293: fearlessly. “I am sure that the truth would clear you.”
30294: 
30295: Lydgate started up from his chair and went towards the window,
30296: forgetting where he was. He had so often gone over in his mind the
30297: possibility of explaining everything without aggravating appearances
30298: that would tell, perhaps unfairly, against Bulstrode, and had so often
30299: decided against it—he had so often said to himself that his assertions
30300: would not change people’s impressions—that Dorothea’s words sounded
30301: like a temptation to do something which in his soberness he had
30302: pronounced to be unreasonable.
30303: 
30304: “Tell me, pray,” said Dorothea, with simple earnestness; “then we can
30305: consult together. It is wicked to let people think evil of any one
30306: falsely, when it can be hindered.”
30307: 
30308: Lydgate turned, remembering where he was, and saw Dorothea’s face
30309: looking up at him with a sweet trustful gravity. The presence of a
30310: noble nature, generous in its wishes, ardent in its charity, changes
30311: the lights for us: we begin to see things again in their larger,
30312: quieter masses, and to believe that we too can be seen and judged in
30313: the wholeness of our character. That influence was beginning to act on
30314: Lydgate, who had for many days been seeing all life as one who is
30315: dragged and struggling amid the throng. He sat down again, and felt
30316: that he was recovering his old self in the consciousness that he was
30317: with one who believed in it.
30318: 
30319: “I don’t want,” he said, “to bear hard on Bulstrode, who has lent me
30320: money of which I was in need—though I would rather have gone without it
30321: now. He is hunted down and miserable, and has only a poor thread of
30322: life in him. But I should like to tell you everything. It will be a
30323: comfort to me to speak where belief has gone beforehand, and where I
30324: shall not seem to be offering assertions of my own honesty. You will
30325: feel what is fair to another, as you feel what is fair to me.”
30326: 
30327: “Do trust me,” said Dorothea; “I will not repeat anything without your
30328: leave. But at the very least, I could say that you have made all the
30329: circumstances clear to me, and that I know you are not in any way
30330: guilty. Mr. Farebrother would believe me, and my uncle, and Sir James
30331: Chettam. Nay, there are persons in Middlemarch to whom I could go;
30332: although they don’t know much of me, they would believe me. They would
30333: know that I could have no other motive than truth and justice. I would
30334: take any pains to clear you. I have very little to do. There is nothing
30335: better that I can do in the world.”
30336: 
30337: Dorothea’s voice, as she made this childlike picture of what she would
30338: do, might have been almost taken as a proof that she could do it
30339: effectively. The searching tenderness of her woman’s tones seemed made
30340: for a defence against ready accusers. Lydgate did not stay to think
30341: that she was Quixotic: he gave himself up, for the first time in his
30342: life, to the exquisite sense of leaning entirely on a generous
30343: sympathy, without any check of proud reserve. And he told her
30344: everything, from the time when, under the pressure of his difficulties,
30345: he unwillingly made his first application to Bulstrode; gradually, in
30346: the relief of speaking, getting into a more thorough utterance of what
30347: had gone on in his mind—entering fully into the fact that his treatment
30348: of the patient was opposed to the dominant practice, into his doubts at
30349: the last, his ideal of medical duty, and his uneasy consciousness that
30350: the acceptance of the money had made some difference in his private
30351: inclination and professional behavior, though not in his fulfilment of
30352: any publicly recognized obligation.
30353: 
30354: “It has come to my knowledge since,” he added, “that Hawley sent some
30355: one to examine the housekeeper at Stone Court, and she said that she
30356: gave the patient all the opium in the phial I left, as well as a good
30357: deal of brandy. But that would not have been opposed to ordinary
30358: prescriptions, even of first-rate men. The suspicions against me had no
30359: hold there: they are grounded on the knowledge that I took money, that
30360: Bulstrode had strong motives for wishing the man to die, and that he
30361: gave me the money as a bribe to concur in some malpractices or other
30362: against the patient—that in any case I accepted a bribe to hold my
30363: tongue. They are just the suspicions that cling the most obstinately,
30364: because they lie in people’s inclination and can never be disproved.
30365: How my orders came to be disobeyed is a question to which I don’t know
30366: the answer. It is still possible that Bulstrode was innocent of any
30367: criminal intention—even possible that he had nothing to do with the
30368: disobedience, and merely abstained from mentioning it. But all that has
30369: nothing to do with the public belief. It is one of those cases on which
30370: a man is condemned on the ground of his character—it is believed that
30371: he has committed a crime in some undefined way, because he had the
30372: motive for doing it; and Bulstrode’s character has enveloped me,
30373: because I took his money. I am simply blighted—like a damaged ear of
30374: corn—the business is done and can’t be undone.”
30375: 
30376: “Oh, it is hard!” said Dorothea. “I understand the difficulty there is
30377: in your vindicating yourself. And that all this should have come to you
30378: who had meant to lead a higher life than the common, and to find out
30379: better ways—I cannot bear to rest in this as unchangeable. I know you
30380: meant that. I remember what you said to me when you first spoke to me
30381: about the hospital. There is no sorrow I have thought more about than
30382: that—to love what is great, and try to reach it, and yet to fail.”
30383: 
30384: “Yes,” said Lydgate, feeling that here he had found room for the full
30385: meaning of his grief. “I had some ambition. I meant everything to be
30386: different with me. I thought I had more strength and mastery. But the
30387: most terrible obstacles are such as nobody can see except oneself.”
30388: 
30389: “Suppose,” said Dorothea, meditatively,—“suppose we kept on the
30390: Hospital according to the present plan, and you stayed here though only
30391: with the friendship and support of a few, the evil feeling towards you
30392: would gradually die out; there would come opportunities in which people
30393: would be forced to acknowledge that they had been unjust to you,
30394: because they would see that your purposes were pure. You may still win
30395: a great fame like the Louis and Laennec I have heard you speak of, and
30396: we shall all be proud of you,” she ended, with a smile.
30397: 
30398: “That might do if I had my old trust in myself,” said Lydgate,
30399: mournfully. “Nothing galls me more than the notion of turning round and
30400: running away before this slander, leaving it unchecked behind me.
30401: Still, I can’t ask any one to put a great deal of money into a plan
30402: which depends on me.”
30403: 
30404: “It would be quite worth my while,” said Dorothea, simply. “Only think.
30405: I am very uncomfortable with my money, because they tell me I have too
30406: little for any great scheme of the sort I like best, and yet I have too
30407: much. I don’t know what to do. I have seven hundred a-year of my own
30408: fortune, and nineteen hundred a-year that Mr. Casaubon left me, and
30409: between three and four thousand of ready money in the bank. I wished to
30410: raise money and pay it off gradually out of my income which I don’t
30411: want, to buy land with and found a village which should be a school of
30412: industry; but Sir James and my uncle have convinced me that the risk
30413: would be too great. So you see that what I should most rejoice at would
30414: be to have something good to do with my money: I should like it to make
30415: other people’s lives better to them. It makes me very uneasy—coming all
30416: to me who don’t want it.”
30417: 
30418: A smile broke through the gloom of Lydgate’s face. The childlike
30419: grave-eyed earnestness with which Dorothea said all this was
30420: irresistible—blent into an adorable whole with her ready understanding
30421: of high experience. (Of lower experience such as plays a great part in
30422: the world, poor Mrs. Casaubon had a very blurred shortsighted
30423: knowledge, little helped by her imagination.) But she took the smile as
30424: encouragement of her plan.
30425: 
30426: “I think you see now that you spoke too scrupulously,” she said, in a
30427: tone of persuasion. “The hospital would be one good; and making your
30428: life quite whole and well again would be another.”
30429: 
30430: Lydgate’s smile had died away. “You have the goodness as well as the
30431: money to do all that; if it could be done,” he said. “But—”
30432: 
30433: He hesitated a little while, looking vaguely towards the window; and
30434: she sat in silent expectation. At last he turned towards her and said
30435: impetuously—
30436: 
30437: “Why should I not tell you?—you know what sort of bond marriage is. You
30438: will understand everything.”
30439: 
30440: Dorothea felt her heart beginning to beat faster. Had he that sorrow
30441: too? But she feared to say any word, and he went on immediately.
30442: 
30443: “It is impossible for me now to do anything—to take any step without
30444: considering my wife’s happiness. The thing that I might like to do if I
30445: were alone, is become impossible to me. I can’t see her miserable. She
30446: married me without knowing what she was going into, and it might have
30447: been better for her if she had not married me.”
30448: 
30449: “I know, I know—you could not give her pain, if you were not obliged to
30450: do it,” said Dorothea, with keen memory of her own life.
30451: 
30452: “And she has set her mind against staying. She wishes to go. The
30453: troubles she has had here have wearied her,” said Lydgate, breaking off
30454: again, lest he should say too much.
30455: 
30456: “But when she saw the good that might come of staying—” said Dorothea,
30457: remonstrantly, looking at Lydgate as if he had forgotten the reasons
30458: which had just been considered. He did not speak immediately.
30459: 
30460: “She would not see it,” he said at last, curtly, feeling at first that
30461: this statement must do without explanation. “And, indeed, I have lost
30462: all spirit about carrying on my life here.” He paused a moment and
30463: then, following the impulse to let Dorothea see deeper into the
30464: difficulty of his life, he said, “The fact is, this trouble has come
30465: upon her confusedly. We have not been able to speak to each other about
30466: it. I am not sure what is in her mind about it: she may fear that I
30467: have really done something base. It is my fault; I ought to be more
30468: open. But I have been suffering cruelly.”
30469: 
30470: “May I go and see her?” said Dorothea, eagerly. “Would she accept my
30471: sympathy? I would tell her that you have not been blamable before any
30472: one’s judgment but your own. I would tell her that you shall be cleared
30473: in every fair mind. I would cheer her heart. Will you ask her if I may
30474: go to see her? I did see her once.”
30475: 
30476: “I am sure you may,” said Lydgate, seizing the proposition with some
30477: hope. “She would feel honored—cheered, I think, by the proof that you
30478: at least have some respect for me. I will not speak to her about your
30479: coming—that she may not connect it with my wishes at all. I know very
30480: well that I ought not to have left anything to be told her by others,
30481: but—”
30482: 
30483: He broke off, and there was a moment’s silence. Dorothea refrained from
30484: saying what was in her mind—how well she knew that there might be
30485: invisible barriers to speech between husband and wife. This was a point
30486: on which even sympathy might make a wound. She returned to the more
30487: outward aspect of Lydgate’s position, saying cheerfully—
30488: 
30489: “And if Mrs. Lydgate knew that there were friends who would believe in
30490: you and support you, she might then be glad that you should stay in
30491: your place and recover your hopes—and do what you meant to do. Perhaps
30492: then you would see that it was right to agree with what I proposed
30493: about your continuing at the Hospital. Surely you would, if you still
30494: have faith in it as a means of making your knowledge useful?”
30495: 
30496: Lydgate did not answer, and she saw that he was debating with himself.
30497: 
30498: “You need not decide immediately,” she said, gently. “A few days hence
30499: it will be early enough for me to send my answer to Mr. Bulstrode.”
30500: 
30501: Lydgate still waited, but at last turned to speak in his most decisive
30502: tones.
30503: 
30504: “No; I prefer that there should be no interval left for wavering. I am
30505: no longer sure enough of myself—I mean of what it would be possible for
30506: me to do under the changed circumstances of my life. It would be
30507: dishonorable to let others engage themselves to anything serious in
30508: dependence on me. I might be obliged to go away after all; I see little
30509: chance of anything else. The whole thing is too problematic; I cannot
30510: consent to be the cause of your goodness being wasted. No—let the new
30511: Hospital be joined with the old Infirmary, and everything go on as it
30512: might have done if I had never come. I have kept a valuable register
30513: since I have been there; I shall send it to a man who will make use of
30514: it,” he ended bitterly. “I can think of nothing for a long while but
30515: getting an income.”
30516: 
30517: “It hurts me very much to hear you speak so hopelessly,” said Dorothea.
30518: “It would be a happiness to your friends, who believe in your future,
30519: in your power to do great things, if you would let them save you from
30520: that. Think how much money I have; it would be like taking a burthen
30521: from me if you took some of it every year till you got free from this
30522: fettering want of income. Why should not people do these things? It is
30523: so difficult to make shares at all even. This is one way.”
30524: 
30525: “God bless you, Mrs. Casaubon!” said Lydgate, rising as if with the
30526: same impulse that made his words energetic, and resting his arm on the
30527: back of the great leather chair he had been sitting in. “It is good
30528: that you should have such feelings. But I am not the man who ought to
30529: allow himself to benefit by them. I have not given guarantees enough. I
30530: must not at least sink into the degradation of being pensioned for work
30531: that I never achieved. It is very clear to me that I must not count on
30532: anything else than getting away from Middlemarch as soon as I can
30533: manage it. I should not be able for a long while, at the very best, to
30534: get an income here, and—and it is easier to make necessary changes in a
30535: new place. I must do as other men do, and think what will please the
30536: world and bring in money; look for a little opening in the London
30537: crowd, and push myself; set up in a watering-place, or go to some
30538: southern town where there are plenty of idle English, and get myself
30539: puffed,—that is the sort of shell I must creep into and try to keep my
30540: soul alive in.”
30541: 
30542: “Now that is not brave,” said Dorothea,—“to give up the fight.”
30543: 
30544: “No, it is not brave,” said Lydgate, “but if a man is afraid of
30545: creeping paralysis?” Then, in another tone, “Yet you have made a great
30546: difference in my courage by believing in me. Everything seems more
30547: bearable since I have talked to you; and if you can clear me in a few
30548: other minds, especially in Farebrother’s, I shall be deeply grateful.
30549: The point I wish you not to mention is the fact of disobedience to my
30550: orders. That would soon get distorted. After all, there is no evidence
30551: for me but people’s opinion of me beforehand. You can only repeat my
30552: own report of myself.”
30553: 
30554: “Mr. Farebrother will believe—others will believe,” said Dorothea. “I
30555: can say of you what will make it stupidity to suppose that you would be
30556: bribed to do a wickedness.”
30557: 
30558: “I don’t know,” said Lydgate, with something like a groan in his voice.
30559: “I have not taken a bribe yet. But there is a pale shade of bribery
30560: which is sometimes called prosperity. You will do me another great
30561: kindness, then, and come to see my wife?”
30562: 
30563: “Yes, I will. I remember how pretty she is,” said Dorothea, into whose
30564: mind every impression about Rosamond had cut deep. “I hope she will
30565: like me.”
30566: 
30567: As Lydgate rode away, he thought, “This young creature has a heart
30568: large enough for the Virgin Mary. She evidently thinks nothing of her
30569: own future, and would pledge away half her income at once, as if she
30570: wanted nothing for herself but a chair to sit in from which she can
30571: look down with those clear eyes at the poor mortals who pray to her.
30572: She seems to have what I never saw in any woman before—a fountain of
30573: friendship towards men—a man can make a friend of her. Casaubon must
30574: have raised some heroic hallucination in her. I wonder if she could
30575: have any other sort of passion for a man? Ladislaw?—there was certainly
30576: an unusual feeling between them. And Casaubon must have had a notion of
30577: it. Well—her love might help a man more than her money.”
30578: 
30579: Dorothea on her side had immediately formed a plan of relieving Lydgate
30580: from his obligation to Bulstrode, which she felt sure was a part,
30581: though small, of the galling pressure he had to bear. She sat down at
30582: once under the inspiration of their interview, and wrote a brief note,
30583: in which she pleaded that she had more claim than Mr. Bulstrode had to
30584: the satisfaction of providing the money which had been serviceable to
30585: Lydgate—that it would be unkind in Lydgate not to grant her the
30586: position of being his helper in this small matter, the favor being
30587: entirely to her who had so little that was plainly marked out for her
30588: to do with her superfluous money. He might call her a creditor or by
30589: any other name if it did but imply that he granted her request. She
30590: enclosed a check for a thousand pounds, and determined to take the
30591: letter with her the next day when she went to see Rosamond.
30592: 
30593: 
30594: 
30595: 
30596: CHAPTER LXXVII.
30597: 
30598: “And thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot,
30599: To mark the full-fraught man and best indued
30600: With some suspicion.”
30601: —_Henry V_.
30602: 
30603: 
30604: The next day Lydgate had to go to Brassing, and told Rosamond that he
30605: should be away until the evening. Of late she had never gone beyond her
30606: own house and garden, except to church, and once to see her papa, to
30607: whom she said, “If Tertius goes away, you will help us to move, will
30608: you not, papa? I suppose we shall have very little money. I am sure I
30609: hope some one will help us.” And Mr. Vincy had said, “Yes, child, I
30610: don’t mind a hundred or two. I can see the end of that.” With these
30611: exceptions she had sat at home in languid melancholy and suspense,
30612: fixing her mind on Will Ladislaw’s coming as the one point of hope and
30613: interest, and associating this with some new urgency on Lydgate to make
30614: immediate arrangements for leaving Middlemarch and going to London,
30615: till she felt assured that the coming would be a potent cause of the
30616: going, without at all seeing how. This way of establishing sequences is
30617: too common to be fairly regarded as a peculiar folly in Rosamond. And
30618: it is precisely this sort of sequence which causes the greatest shock
30619: when it is sundered: for to see how an effect may be produced is often
30620: to see possible missings and checks; but to see nothing except the
30621: desirable cause, and close upon it the desirable effect, rids us of
30622: doubt and makes our minds strongly intuitive. That was the process
30623: going on in poor Rosamond, while she arranged all objects around her
30624: with the same nicety as ever, only with more slowness—or sat down to
30625: the piano, meaning to play, and then desisting, yet lingering on the
30626: music stool with her white fingers suspended on the wooden front, and
30627: looking before her in dreamy ennui. Her melancholy had become so marked
30628: that Lydgate felt a strange timidity before it, as a perpetual silent
30629: reproach, and the strong man, mastered by his keen sensibilities
30630: towards this fair fragile creature whose life he seemed somehow to have
30631: bruised, shrank from her look, and sometimes started at her approach,
30632: fear of her and fear for her rushing in only the more forcibly after it
30633: had been momentarily expelled by exasperation.
30634: 
30635: But this morning Rosamond descended from her room upstairs—where she
30636: sometimes sat the whole day when Lydgate was out—equipped for a walk in
30637: the town. She had a letter to post—a letter addressed to Mr. Ladislaw
30638: and written with charming discretion, but intended to hasten his
30639: arrival by a hint of trouble. The servant-maid, their sole
30640: house-servant now, noticed her coming down-stairs in her walking dress,
30641: and thought “there never did anybody look so pretty in a bonnet poor
30642: thing.”
30643: 
30644: Meanwhile Dorothea’s mind was filled with her project of going to
30645: Rosamond, and with the many thoughts, both of the past and the probable
30646: future, which gathered round the idea of that visit. Until yesterday
30647: when Lydgate had opened to her a glimpse of some trouble in his married
30648: life, the image of Mrs. Lydgate had always been associated for her with
30649: that of Will Ladislaw. Even in her most uneasy moments—even when she
30650: had been agitated by Mrs. Cadwallader’s painfully graphic report of
30651: gossip—her effort, nay, her strongest impulsive prompting, had been
30652: towards the vindication of Will from any sullying surmises; and when,
30653: in her meeting with him afterwards, she had at first interpreted his
30654: words as a probable allusion to a feeling towards Mrs. Lydgate which he
30655: was determined to cut himself off from indulging, she had had a quick,
30656: sad, excusing vision of the charm there might be in his constant
30657: opportunities of companionship with that fair creature, who most likely
30658: shared his other tastes as she evidently did his delight in music. But
30659: there had followed his parting words—the few passionate words in which
30660: he had implied that she herself was the object of whom his love held
30661: him in dread, that it was his love for her only which he was resolved
30662: not to declare but to carry away into banishment. From the time of that
30663: parting, Dorothea, believing in Will’s love for her, believing with a
30664: proud delight in his delicate sense of honor and his determination that
30665: no one should impeach him justly, felt her heart quite at rest as to
30666: the regard he might have for Mrs. Lydgate. She was sure that the regard
30667: was blameless.
30668: 
30669: There are natures in which, if they love us, we are conscious of having
30670: a sort of baptism and consecration: they bind us over to rectitude and
30671: purity by their pure belief about us; and our sins become that worst
30672: kind of sacrilege which tears down the invisible altar of trust. “If
30673: you are not good, none is good”—those little words may give a terrific
30674: meaning to responsibility, may hold a vitriolic intensity for remorse.
30675: 
30676: Dorothea’s nature was of that kind: her own passionate faults lay along
30677: the easily counted open channels of her ardent character; and while she
30678: was full of pity for the visible mistakes of others, she had not yet
30679: any material within her experience for subtle constructions and
30680: suspicions of hidden wrong. But that simplicity of hers, holding up an
30681: ideal for others in her believing conception of them, was one of the
30682: great powers of her womanhood. And it had from the first acted strongly
30683: on Will Ladislaw. He felt, when he parted from her, that the brief
30684: words by which he had tried to convey to her his feeling about herself
30685: and the division which her fortune made between them, would only profit
30686: by their brevity when Dorothea had to interpret them: he felt that in
30687: her mind he had found his highest estimate.
30688: 
30689: And he was right there. In the months since their parting Dorothea had
30690: felt a delicious though sad repose in their relation to each other, as
30691: one which was inwardly whole and without blemish. She had an active
30692: force of antagonism within her, when the antagonism turned on the
30693: defence either of plans or persons that she believed in; and the wrongs
30694: which she felt that Will had received from her husband, and the
30695: external conditions which to others were grounds for slighting him,
30696: only gave the more tenacity to her affection and admiring judgment. And
30697: now with the disclosures about Bulstrode had come another fact
30698: affecting Will’s social position, which roused afresh Dorothea’s inward
30699: resistance to what was said about him in that part of her world which
30700: lay within park palings.
30701: 
30702: “Young Ladislaw the grandson of a thieving Jew pawnbroker” was a phrase
30703: which had entered emphatically into the dialogues about the Bulstrode
30704: business, at Lowick, Tipton, and Freshitt, and was a worse kind of
30705: placard on poor Will’s back than the “Italian with white mice.” Upright
30706: Sir James Chettam was convinced that his own satisfaction was righteous
30707: when he thought with some complacency that here was an added league to
30708: that mountainous distance between Ladislaw and Dorothea, which enabled
30709: him to dismiss any anxiety in that direction as too absurd. And perhaps
30710: there had been some pleasure in pointing Mr. Brooke’s attention to this
30711: ugly bit of Ladislaw’s genealogy, as a fresh candle for him to see his
30712: own folly by. Dorothea had observed the animus with which Will’s part
30713: in the painful story had been recalled more than once; but she had
30714: uttered no word, being checked now, as she had not been formerly in
30715: speaking of Will, by the consciousness of a deeper relation between
30716: them which must always remain in consecrated secrecy. But her silence
30717: shrouded her resistant emotion into a more thorough glow; and this
30718: misfortune in Will’s lot which, it seemed, others were wishing to fling
30719: at his back as an opprobrium, only gave something more of enthusiasm to
30720: her clinging thought.
30721: 
30722: She entertained no visions of their ever coming into nearer union, and
30723: yet she had taken no posture of renunciation. She had accepted her
30724: whole relation to Will very simply as part of her marriage sorrows, and
30725: would have thought it very sinful in her to keep up an inward wail
30726: because she was not completely happy, being rather disposed to dwell on
30727: the superfluities of her lot. She could bear that the chief pleasures
30728: of her tenderness should lie in memory, and the idea of marriage came
30729: to her solely as a repulsive proposition from some suitor of whom she
30730: at present knew nothing, but whose merits, as seen by her friends,
30731: would be a source of torment to her:—“somebody who will manage your
30732: property for you, my dear,” was Mr. Brooke’s attractive suggestion of
30733: suitable characteristics. “I should like to manage it myself, if I knew
30734: what to do with it,” said Dorothea. No—she adhered to her declaration
30735: that she would never be married again, and in the long valley of her
30736: life which looked so flat and empty of waymarks, guidance would come as
30737: she walked along the road, and saw her fellow-passengers by the way.
30738: 
30739: This habitual state of feeling about Will Ladislaw had been strong in
30740: all her waking hours since she had proposed to pay a visit to Mrs.
30741: Lydgate, making a sort of background against which she saw Rosamond’s
30742: figure presented to her without hindrances to her interest and
30743: compassion. There was evidently some mental separation, some barrier to
30744: complete confidence which had arisen between this wife and the husband
30745: who had yet made her happiness a law to him. That was a trouble which
30746: no third person must directly touch. But Dorothea thought with deep
30747: pity of the loneliness which must have come upon Rosamond from the
30748: suspicions cast on her husband; and there would surely be help in the
30749: manifestation of respect for Lydgate and sympathy with her.
30750: 
30751: “I shall talk to her about her husband,” thought Dorothea, as she was
30752: being driven towards the town. The clear spring morning, the scent of
30753: the moist earth, the fresh leaves just showing their creased-up wealth
30754: of greenery from out their half-opened sheaths, seemed part of the
30755: cheerfulness she was feeling from a long conversation with Mr.
30756: Farebrother, who had joyfully accepted the justifying explanation of
30757: Lydgate’s conduct. “I shall take Mrs. Lydgate good news, and perhaps
30758: she will like to talk to me and make a friend of me.”
30759: 
30760: Dorothea had another errand in Lowick Gate: it was about a new
30761: fine-toned bell for the school-house, and as she had to get out of her
30762: carriage very near to Lydgate’s, she walked thither across the street,
30763: having told the coachman to wait for some packages. The street door was
30764: open, and the servant was taking the opportunity of looking out at the
30765: carriage which was pausing within sight when it became apparent to her
30766: that the lady who “belonged to it” was coming towards her.
30767: 
30768: “Is Mrs. Lydgate at home?” said Dorothea.
30769: 
30770: “I’m not sure, my lady; I’ll see, if you’ll please to walk in,” said
30771: Martha, a little confused on the score of her kitchen apron, but
30772: collected enough to be sure that “mum” was not the right title for this
30773: queenly young widow with a carriage and pair. “Will you please to walk
30774: in, and I’ll go and see.”
30775: 
30776: “Say that I am Mrs. Casaubon,” said Dorothea, as Martha moved forward
30777: intending to show her into the drawing-room and then to go up-stairs to
30778: see if Rosamond had returned from her walk.
30779: 
30780: They crossed the broader part of the entrance-hall, and turned up the
30781: passage which led to the garden. The drawing-room door was unlatched,
30782: and Martha, pushing it without looking into the room, waited for Mrs.
30783: Casaubon to enter and then turned away, the door having swung open and
30784: swung back again without noise.
30785: 
30786: Dorothea had less of outward vision than usual this morning, being
30787: filled with images of things as they had been and were going to be. She
30788: found herself on the other side of the door without seeing anything
30789: remarkable, but immediately she heard a voice speaking in low tones
30790: which startled her as with a sense of dreaming in daylight, and
30791: advancing unconsciously a step or two beyond the projecting slab of a
30792: bookcase, she saw, in the terrible illumination of a certainty which
30793: filled up all outlines, something which made her pause, motionless,
30794: without self-possession enough to speak.
30795: 
30796: Seated with his back towards her on a sofa which stood against the wall
30797: on a line with the door by which she had entered, she saw Will
30798: Ladislaw: close by him and turned towards him with a flushed
30799: tearfulness which gave a new brilliancy to her face sat Rosamond, her
30800: bonnet hanging back, while Will leaning towards her clasped both her
30801: upraised hands in his and spoke with low-toned fervor.
30802: 
30803: Rosamond in her agitated absorption had not noticed the silently
30804: advancing figure; but when Dorothea, after the first immeasurable
30805: instant of this vision, moved confusedly backward and found herself
30806: impeded by some piece of furniture, Rosamond was suddenly aware of her
30807: presence, and with a spasmodic movement snatched away her hands and
30808: rose, looking at Dorothea who was necessarily arrested. Will Ladislaw,
30809: starting up, looked round also, and meeting Dorothea’s eyes with a new
30810: lightning in them, seemed changing to marble. But she immediately
30811: turned them away from him to Rosamond and said in a firm voice—
30812: 
30813: “Excuse me, Mrs. Lydgate, the servant did not know that you were here.
30814: I called to deliver an important letter for Mr. Lydgate, which I wished
30815: to put into your own hands.”
30816: 
30817: She laid down the letter on the small table which had checked her
30818: retreat, and then including Rosamond and Will in one distant glance and
30819: bow, she went quickly out of the room, meeting in the passage the
30820: surprised Martha, who said she was sorry the mistress was not at home,
30821: and then showed the strange lady out with an inward reflection that
30822: grand people were probably more impatient than others.
30823: 
30824: Dorothea walked across the street with her most elastic step and was
30825: quickly in her carriage again.
30826: 
30827: “Drive on to Freshitt Hall,” she said to the coachman, and any one
30828: looking at her might have thought that though she was paler than usual
30829: she was never animated by a more self-possessed energy. And that was
30830: really her experience. It was as if she had drunk a great draught of
30831: scorn that stimulated her beyond the susceptibility to other feelings.
30832: She had seen something so far below her belief, that her emotions
30833: rushed back from it and made an excited throng without an object. She
30834: needed something active to turn her excitement out upon. She felt power
30835: to walk and work for a day, without meat or drink. And she would carry
30836: out the purpose with which she had started in the morning, of going to
30837: Freshitt and Tipton to tell Sir James and her uncle all that she wished
30838: them to know about Lydgate, whose married loneliness under his trial
30839: now presented itself to her with new significance, and made her more
30840: ardent in readiness to be his champion. She had never felt anything
30841: like this triumphant power of indignation in the struggle of her
30842: married life, in which there had always been a quickly subduing pang;
30843: and she took it as a sign of new strength.
30844: 
30845: “Dodo, how very bright your eyes are!” said Celia, when Sir James was
30846: gone out of the room. “And you don’t see anything you look at, Arthur
30847: or anything. You are going to do something uncomfortable, I know. Is it
30848: all about Mr. Lydgate, or has something else happened?” Celia had been
30849: used to watch her sister with expectation.
30850: 
30851: “Yes, dear, a great many things have happened,” said Dodo, in her full
30852: tones.
30853: 
30854: “I wonder what,” said Celia, folding her arms cozily and leaning
30855: forward upon them.
30856: 
30857: “Oh, all the troubles of all people on the face of the earth,” said
30858: Dorothea, lifting her arms to the back of her head.
30859: 
30860: “Dear me, Dodo, are you going to have a scheme for them?” said Celia, a
30861: little uneasy at this Hamlet-like raving.
30862: 
30863: But Sir James came in again, ready to accompany Dorothea to the Grange,
30864: and she finished her expedition well, not swerving in her resolution
30865: until she descended at her own door.
30866: 
30867: 
30868: 
30869: 
30870: CHAPTER LXXVIII.
30871: 
30872: “Would it were yesterday and I i’ the grave,
30873: With her sweet faith above for monument.”
30874: 
30875: 
30876: Rosamond and Will stood motionless—they did not know how long—he
30877: looking towards the spot where Dorothea had stood, and she looking
30878: towards him with doubt. It seemed an endless time to Rosamond, in whose
30879: inmost soul there was hardly so much annoyance as gratification from
30880: what had just happened. Shallow natures dream of an easy sway over the
30881: emotions of others, trusting implicitly in their own petty magic to
30882: turn the deepest streams, and confident, by pretty gestures and
30883: remarks, of making the thing that is not as though it were. She knew
30884: that Will had received a severe blow, but she had been little used to
30885: imagining other people’s states of mind except as a material cut into
30886: shape by her own wishes; and she believed in her own power to soothe or
30887: subdue. Even Tertius, that most perverse of men, was always subdued in
30888: the long-run: events had been obstinate, but still Rosamond would have
30889: said now, as she did before her marriage, that she never gave up what
30890: she had set her mind on.
30891: 
30892: She put out her arm and laid the tips of her fingers on Will’s
30893: coat-sleeve.
30894: 
30895: “Don’t touch me!” he said, with an utterance like the cut of a lash,
30896: darting from her, and changing from pink to white and back again, as if
30897: his whole frame were tingling with the pain of the sting. He wheeled
30898: round to the other side of the room and stood opposite to her, with the
30899: tips of his fingers in his pockets and his head thrown back, looking
30900: fiercely not at Rosamond but at a point a few inches away from her.
30901: 
30902: She was keenly offended, but the signs she made of this were such as
30903: only Lydgate was used to interpret. She became suddenly quiet and
30904: seated herself, untying her hanging bonnet and laying it down with her
30905: shawl. Her little hands which she folded before her were very cold.
30906: 
30907: It would have been safer for Will in the first instance to have taken
30908: up his hat and gone away; but he had felt no impulse to do this; on the
30909: contrary, he had a horrible inclination to stay and shatter Rosamond
30910: with his anger. It seemed as impossible to bear the fatality she had
30911: drawn down on him without venting his fury as it would be to a panther
30912: to bear the javelin-wound without springing and biting. And yet—how
30913: could he tell a woman that he was ready to curse her? He was fuming
30914: under a repressive law which he was forced to acknowledge: he was
30915: dangerously poised, and Rosamond’s voice now brought the decisive
30916: vibration. In flute-like tones of sarcasm she said—
30917: 
30918: “You can easily go after Mrs. Casaubon and explain your preference.”
30919: 
30920: “Go after her!” he burst out, with a sharp edge in his voice. “Do you
30921: think she would turn to look at me, or value any word I ever uttered to
30922: her again at more than a dirty feather?—Explain! How can a man explain
30923: at the expense of a woman?”
30924: 
30925: “You can tell her what you please,” said Rosamond with more tremor.
30926: 
30927: “Do you suppose she would like me better for sacrificing you? She is
30928: not a woman to be flattered because I made myself despicable—to believe
30929: that I must be true to her because I was a dastard to you.”
30930: 
30931: He began to move about with the restlessness of a wild animal that sees
30932: prey but cannot reach it. Presently he burst out again—
30933: 
30934: “I had no hope before—not much—of anything better to come. But I had
30935: one certainty—that she believed in me. Whatever people had said or done
30936: about me, she believed in me.—That’s gone! She’ll never again think me
30937: anything but a paltry pretence—too nice to take heaven except upon
30938: flattering conditions, and yet selling myself for any devil’s change by
30939: the sly. She’ll think of me as an incarnate insult to her, from the
30940: first moment we—”
30941: 
30942: Will stopped as if he had found himself grasping something that must
30943: not be thrown and shattered. He found another vent for his rage by
30944: snatching up Rosamond’s words again, as if they were reptiles to be
30945: throttled and flung off.
30946: 
30947: “Explain! Tell a man to explain how he dropped into hell! Explain my
30948: preference! I never had a _preference_ for her, any more than I have a
30949: preference for breathing. No other woman exists by the side of her. I
30950: would rather touch her hand if it were dead, than I would touch any
30951: other woman’s living.”
30952: 
30953: Rosamond, while these poisoned weapons were being hurled at her, was
30954: almost losing the sense of her identity, and seemed to be waking into
30955: some new terrible existence. She had no sense of chill resolute
30956: repulsion, of reticent self-justification such as she had known under
30957: Lydgate’s most stormy displeasure: all her sensibility was turned into
30958: a bewildering novelty of pain; she felt a new terrified recoil under a
30959: lash never experienced before. What another nature felt in opposition
30960: to her own was being burnt and bitten into her consciousness. When Will
30961: had ceased to speak she had become an image of sickened misery: her
30962: lips were pale, and her eyes had a tearless dismay in them. If it had
30963: been Tertius who stood opposite to her, that look of misery would have
30964: been a pang to him, and he would have sunk by her side to comfort her,
30965: with that strong-armed comfort which she had often held very cheap.
30966: 
30967: Let it be forgiven to Will that he had no such movement of pity. He had
30968: felt no bond beforehand to this woman who had spoiled the ideal
30969: treasure of his life, and he held himself blameless. He knew that he
30970: was cruel, but he had no relenting in him yet.
30971: 
30972: After he had done speaking, he still moved about, half in absence of
30973: mind, and Rosamond sat perfectly still. At length Will, seeming to
30974: bethink himself, took up his hat, yet stood some moments irresolute. He
30975: had spoken to her in a way that made a phrase of common politeness
30976: difficult to utter; and yet, now that he had come to the point of going
30977: away from her without further speech, he shrank from it as a brutality;
30978: he felt checked and stultified in his anger. He walked towards the
30979: mantel-piece and leaned his arm on it, and waited in silence for—he
30980: hardly knew what. The vindictive fire was still burning in him, and he
30981: could utter no word of retractation; but it was nevertheless in his
30982: mind that having come back to this hearth where he had enjoyed a
30983: caressing friendship he had found calamity seated there—he had had
30984: suddenly revealed to him a trouble that lay outside the home as well as
30985: within it. And what seemed a foreboding was pressing upon him as with
30986: slow pincers:—that his life might come to be enslaved by this helpless
30987: woman who had thrown herself upon him in the dreary sadness of her
30988: heart. But he was in gloomy rebellion against the fact that his quick
30989: apprehensiveness foreshadowed to him, and when his eyes fell on
30990: Rosamond’s blighted face it seemed to him that he was the more pitiable
30991: of the two; for pain must enter into its glorified life of memory
30992: before it can turn into compassion.
30993: 
30994: And so they remained for many minutes, opposite each other, far apart,
30995: in silence; Will’s face still possessed by a mute rage, and Rosamond’s
30996: by a mute misery. The poor thing had no force to fling out any passion
30997: in return; the terrible collapse of the illusion towards which all her
30998: hope had been strained was a stroke which had too thoroughly shaken
30999: her: her little world was in ruins, and she felt herself tottering in
31000: the midst as a lonely bewildered consciousness.
31001: 
31002: Will wished that she would speak and bring some mitigating shadow
31003: across his own cruel speech, which seemed to stand staring at them both
31004: in mockery of any attempt at revived fellowship. But she said nothing,
31005: and at last with a desperate effort over himself, he asked, “Shall I
31006: come in and see Lydgate this evening?”
31007: 
31008: “If you like,” Rosamond answered, just audibly.
31009: 
31010: And then Will went out of the house, Martha never knowing that he had
31011: been in.
31012: 
31013: After he was gone, Rosamond tried to get up from her seat, but fell
31014: back fainting. When she came to herself again, she felt too ill to make
31015: the exertion of rising to ring the bell, and she remained helpless
31016: until the girl, surprised at her long absence, thought for the first
31017: time of looking for her in all the down-stairs rooms. Rosamond said
31018: that she had felt suddenly sick and faint, and wanted to be helped
31019: up-stairs. When there she threw herself on the bed with her clothes on,
31020: and lay in apparent torpor, as she had done once before on a memorable
31021: day of grief.
31022: 
31023: Lydgate came home earlier than he had expected, about half-past five,
31024: and found her there. The perception that she was ill threw every other
31025: thought into the background. When he felt her pulse, her eyes rested on
31026: him with more persistence than they had done for a long while, as if
31027: she felt some content that he was there. He perceived the difference in
31028: a moment, and seating himself by her put his arm gently under her, and
31029: bending over her said, “My poor Rosamond! has something agitated you?”
31030: Clinging to him she fell into hysterical sobbings and cries, and for
31031: the next hour he did nothing but soothe and tend her. He imagined that
31032: Dorothea had been to see her, and that all this effect on her nervous
31033: system, which evidently involved some new turning towards himself, was
31034: due to the excitement of the new impressions which that visit had
31035: raised.
31036: 
31037: 
31038: 
31039: 
31040: CHAPTER LXXIX.
31041: 
31042: “Now, I saw in my dream, that just as they had ended their talk, they
31043: drew nigh to a very miry slough, that was in the midst of the plain;
31044: and they, being heedless, did both fall suddenly into the bog. The name
31045: of the slough was Despond.”—BUNYAN.
31046: 
31047: 
31048: When Rosamond was quiet, and Lydgate had left her, hoping that she
31049: might soon sleep under the effect of an anodyne, he went into the
31050: drawing-room to fetch a book which he had left there, meaning to spend
31051: the evening in his work-room, and he saw on the table Dorothea’s letter
31052: addressed to him. He had not ventured to ask Rosamond if Mrs. Casaubon
31053: had called, but the reading of this letter assured him of the fact, for
31054: Dorothea mentioned that it was to be carried by herself.
31055: 
31056: When Will Ladislaw came in a little later Lydgate met him with a
31057: surprise which made it clear that he had not been told of the earlier
31058: visit, and Will could not say, “Did not Mrs. Lydgate tell you that I
31059: came this morning?”
31060: 
31061: “Poor Rosamond is ill,” Lydgate added immediately on his greeting.
31062: 
31063: “Not seriously, I hope,” said Will.
31064: 
31065: “No—only a slight nervous shock—the effect of some agitation. She has
31066: been overwrought lately. The truth is, Ladislaw, I am an unlucky devil.
31067: We have gone through several rounds of purgatory since you left, and I
31068: have lately got on to a worse ledge of it than ever. I suppose you are
31069: only just come down—you look rather battered—you have not been long
31070: enough in the town to hear anything?”
31071: 
31072: “I travelled all night and got to the White Hart at eight o’clock this
31073: morning. I have been shutting myself up and resting,” said Will,
31074: feeling himself a sneak, but seeing no alternative to this evasion.
31075: 
31076: And then he heard Lydgate’s account of the troubles which Rosamond had
31077: already depicted to him in her way. She had not mentioned the fact of
31078: Will’s name being connected with the public story—this detail not
31079: immediately affecting her—and he now heard it for the first time.
31080: 
31081: “I thought it better to tell you that your name is mixed up with the
31082: disclosures,” said Lydgate, who could understand better than most men
31083: how Ladislaw might be stung by the revelation. “You will be sure to
31084: hear it as soon as you turn out into the town. I suppose it is true
31085: that Raffles spoke to you.”
31086: 
31087: “Yes,” said Will, sardonically. “I shall be fortunate if gossip does
31088: not make me the most disreputable person in the whole affair. I should
31089: think the latest version must be, that I plotted with Raffles to murder
31090: Bulstrode, and ran away from Middlemarch for the purpose.”
31091: 
31092: He was thinking “Here is a new ring in the sound of my name to
31093: recommend it in her hearing; however—what does it signify now?”
31094: 
31095: But he said nothing of Bulstrode’s offer to him. Will was very open and
31096: careless about his personal affairs, but it was among the more
31097: exquisite touches in nature’s modelling of him that he had a delicate
31098: generosity which warned him into reticence here. He shrank from saying
31099: that he had rejected Bulstrode’s money, in the moment when he was
31100: learning that it was Lydgate’s misfortune to have accepted it.
31101: 
31102: Lydgate too was reticent in the midst of his confidence. He made no
31103: allusion to Rosamond’s feeling under their trouble, and of Dorothea he
31104: only said, “Mrs. Casaubon has been the one person to come forward and
31105: say that she had no belief in any of the suspicions against me.”
31106: Observing a change in Will’s face, he avoided any further mention of
31107: her, feeling himself too ignorant of their relation to each other not
31108: to fear that his words might have some hidden painful bearing on it.
31109: And it occurred to him that Dorothea was the real cause of the present
31110: visit to Middlemarch.
31111: 
31112: The two men were pitying each other, but it was only Will who guessed
31113: the extent of his companion’s trouble. When Lydgate spoke with
31114: desperate resignation of going to settle in London, and said with a
31115: faint smile, “We shall have you again, old fellow,” Will felt
31116: inexpressibly mournful, and said nothing. Rosamond had that morning
31117: entreated him to urge this step on Lydgate; and it seemed to him as if
31118: he were beholding in a magic panorama a future where he himself was
31119: sliding into that pleasureless yielding to the small solicitations of
31120: circumstance, which is a commoner history of perdition than any single
31121: momentous bargain.
31122: 
31123: We are on a perilous margin when we begin to look passively at our
31124: future selves, and see our own figures led with dull consent into
31125: insipid misdoing and shabby achievement. Poor Lydgate was inwardly
31126: groaning on that margin, and Will was arriving at it. It seemed to him
31127: this evening as if the cruelty of his outburst to Rosamond had made an
31128: obligation for him, and he dreaded the obligation: he dreaded Lydgate’s
31129: unsuspecting good-will: he dreaded his own distaste for his spoiled
31130: life, which would leave him in motiveless levity.

31135: CHAPTER LXXX.
31136: 
31137: Stern lawgiver! yet thou dost wear
31138: The Godhead’s most benignant grace;
31139: Nor know we anything so fair
31140: As is the smile upon thy face;
31141: Flowers laugh before thee on their beds,
31142: And fragrance in thy footing treads;
31143: Thou dost preserve the Stars from wrong;
31144: And the most ancient Heavens, through thee, are fresh and strong.
31145: —WORDSWORTH: _Ode to Duty_.
31146: 
31147: 
31148: When Dorothea had seen Mr. Farebrother in the morning, she had promised
31149: to go and dine at the parsonage on her return from Freshitt. There was
31150: a frequent interchange of visits between her and the Farebrother
31151: family, which enabled her to say that she was not at all lonely at the
31152: Manor, and to resist for the present the severe prescription of a lady
31153: companion. When she reached home and remembered her engagement, she was
31154: glad of it; and finding that she had still an hour before she could
31155: dress for dinner, she walked straight to the schoolhouse and entered
31156: into a conversation with the master and mistress about the new bell,
31157: giving eager attention to their small details and repetitions, and
31158: getting up a dramatic sense that her life was very busy. She paused on
31159: her way back to talk to old Master Bunney who was putting in some
31160: garden-seeds, and discoursed wisely with that rural sage about the
31161: crops that would make the most return on a perch of ground, and the
31162: result of sixty years’ experience as to soils—namely, that if your soil
31163: was pretty mellow it would do, but if there came wet, wet, wet to make
31164: it all of a mummy, why then—
31165: 
31166: Finding that the social spirit had beguiled her into being rather late,
31167: she dressed hastily and went over to the parsonage rather earlier than
31168: was necessary. That house was never dull, Mr. Farebrother, like another
31169: White of Selborne, having continually something new to tell of his
31170: inarticulate guests and _proteges_, whom he was teaching the boys not
31171: to torment; and he had just set up a pair of beautiful goats to be pets
31172: of the village in general, and to walk at large as sacred animals. The
31173: evening went by cheerfully till after tea, Dorothea talking more than
31174: usual and dilating with Mr. Farebrother on the possible histories of
31175: creatures that converse compendiously with their antennae, and for
31176: aught we know may hold reformed parliaments; when suddenly some
31177: inarticulate little sounds were heard which called everybody’s
31178: attention.
31179: 
31180: “Henrietta Noble,” said Mrs. Farebrother, seeing her small sister
31181: moving about the furniture-legs distressfully, “what is the matter?”
31182: 
31183: “I have lost my tortoise-shell lozenge-box. I fear the kitten has
31184: rolled it away,” said the tiny old lady, involuntarily continuing her
31185: beaver-like notes.
31186: 
31187: “Is it a great treasure, aunt?” said Mr. Farebrother, putting up his
31188: glasses and looking at the carpet.
31189: 
31190: “Mr. Ladislaw gave it me,” said Miss Noble. “A German box—very pretty,
31191: but if it falls it always spins away as far as it can.”
31192: 
31193: “Oh, if it is Ladislaw’s present,” said Mr. Farebrother, in a deep tone
31194: of comprehension, getting up and hunting. The box was found at last
31195: under a chiffonier, and Miss Noble grasped it with delight, saying, “it
31196: was under a fender the last time.”
31197: 
31198: “That is an affair of the heart with my aunt,” said Mr. Farebrother,
31199: smiling at Dorothea, as he reseated himself.
31200: 
31201: “If Henrietta Noble forms an attachment to any one, Mrs. Casaubon,”
31202: said his mother, emphatically,—“she is like a dog—she would take their
31203: shoes for a pillow and sleep the better.”
31204: 
31205: “Mr. Ladislaw’s shoes, I would,” said Henrietta Noble.
31206: 
31207: Dorothea made an attempt at smiling in return. She was surprised and
31208: annoyed to find that her heart was palpitating violently, and that it
31209: was quite useless to try after a recovery of her former animation.
31210: Alarmed at herself—fearing some further betrayal of a change so marked
31211: in its occasion, she rose and said in a low voice with undisguised
31212: anxiety, “I must go; I have overtired myself.”
31213: 
31214: Mr. Farebrother, quick in perception, rose and said, “It is true; you
31215: must have half-exhausted yourself in talking about Lydgate. That sort
31216: of work tells upon one after the excitement is over.”
31217: 
31218: He gave her his arm back to the Manor, but Dorothea did not attempt to
31219: speak, even when he said good-night.
31220: 
31221: The limit of resistance was reached, and she had sunk back helpless
31222: within the clutch of inescapable anguish. Dismissing Tantripp with a
31223: few faint words, she locked her door, and turning away from it towards
31224: the vacant room she pressed her hands hard on the top of her head, and
31225: moaned out—
31226: 
31227: “Oh, I did love him!”
31228: 
31229: Then came the hour in which the waves of suffering shook her too
31230: thoroughly to leave any power of thought. She could only cry in loud
31231: whispers, between her sobs, after her lost belief which she had planted
31232: and kept alive from a very little seed since the days in Rome—after her
31233: lost joy of clinging with silent love and faith to one who, misprized
31234: by others, was worthy in her thought—after her lost woman’s pride of
31235: reigning in his memory—after her sweet dim perspective of hope, that
31236: along some pathway they should meet with unchanged recognition and take
31237: up the backward years as a yesterday.
31238: 
31239: In that hour she repeated what the merciful eyes of solitude have
31240: looked on for ages in the spiritual struggles of man—she besought
31241: hardness and coldness and aching weariness to bring her relief from the
31242: mysterious incorporeal might of her anguish: she lay on the bare floor
31243: and let the night grow cold around her; while her grand woman’s frame
31244: was shaken by sobs as if she had been a despairing child.
31245: 
31246: There were two images—two living forms that tore her heart in two, as
31247: if it had been the heart of a mother who seems to see her child divided
31248: by the sword, and presses one bleeding half to her breast while her
31249: gaze goes forth in agony towards the half which is carried away by the
31250: lying woman that has never known the mother’s pang.
31251: 
31252: Here, with the nearness of an answering smile, here within the
31253: vibrating bond of mutual speech, was the bright creature whom she had
31254: trusted—who had come to her like the spirit of morning visiting the dim
31255: vault where she sat as the bride of a worn-out life; and now, with a
31256: full consciousness which had never awakened before, she stretched out
31257: her arms towards him and cried with bitter cries that their nearness
31258: was a parting vision: she discovered her passion to herself in the
31259: unshrinking utterance of despair.
31260: 
31261: And there, aloof, yet persistently with her, moving wherever she moved,
31262: was the Will Ladislaw who was a changed belief exhausted of hope, a
31263: detected illusion—no, a living man towards whom there could not yet
31264: struggle any wail of regretful pity, from the midst of scorn and
31265: indignation and jealous offended pride. The fire of Dorothea’s anger
31266: was not easily spent, and it flamed out in fitful returns of spurning
31267: reproach. Why had he come obtruding his life into hers, hers that might
31268: have been whole enough without him? Why had he brought his cheap regard
31269: and his lip-born words to her who had nothing paltry to give in
31270: exchange? He knew that he was deluding her—wished, in the very moment
31271: of farewell, to make her believe that he gave her the whole price of
31272: her heart, and knew that he had spent it half before. Why had he not
31273: stayed among the crowd of whom she asked nothing—but only prayed that
31274: they might be less contemptible?
31275: 
31276: But she lost energy at last even for her loud-whispered cries and
31277: moans: she subsided into helpless sobs, and on the cold floor she
31278: sobbed herself to sleep.
31279: 
31280: In the chill hours of the morning twilight, when all was dim around
31281: her, she awoke—not with any amazed wondering where she was or what had
31282: happened, but with the clearest consciousness that she was looking into
31283: the eyes of sorrow. She rose, and wrapped warm things around her, and
31284: seated herself in a great chair where she had often watched before. She
31285: was vigorous enough to have borne that hard night without feeling ill
31286: in body, beyond some aching and fatigue; but she had waked to a new
31287: condition: she felt as if her soul had been liberated from its terrible
31288: conflict; she was no longer wrestling with her grief, but could sit
31289: down with it as a lasting companion and make it a sharer in her
31290: thoughts. For now the thoughts came thickly. It was not in Dorothea’s
31291: nature, for longer than the duration of a paroxysm, to sit in the
31292: narrow cell of her calamity, in the besotted misery of a consciousness
31293: that only sees another’s lot as an accident of its own.
31294: 
31295: She began now to live through that yesterday morning deliberately
31296: again, forcing herself to dwell on every detail and its possible
31297: meaning. Was she alone in that scene? Was it her event only? She forced
31298: herself to think of it as bound up with another woman’s life—a woman
31299: towards whom she had set out with a longing to carry some clearness and
31300: comfort into her beclouded youth. In her first outleap of jealous
31301: indignation and disgust, when quitting the hateful room, she had flung
31302: away all the mercy with which she had undertaken that visit. She had
31303: enveloped both Will and Rosamond in her burning scorn, and it seemed to
31304: her as if Rosamond were burned out of her sight forever. But that base
31305: prompting which makes a women more cruel to a rival than to a faithless
31306: lover, could have no strength of recurrence in Dorothea when the
31307: dominant spirit of justice within her had once overcome the tumult and
31308: had once shown her the truer measure of things. All the active thought
31309: with which she had before been representing to herself the trials of
31310: Lydgate’s lot, and this young marriage union which, like her own,
31311: seemed to have its hidden as well as evident troubles—all this vivid
31312: sympathetic experience returned to her now as a power: it asserted
31313: itself as acquired knowledge asserts itself and will not let us see as
31314: we saw in the day of our ignorance. She said to her own irremediable
31315: grief, that it should make her more helpful, instead of driving her
31316: back from effort.
31317: 
31318: And what sort of crisis might not this be in three lives whose contact
31319: with hers laid an obligation on her as if they had been suppliants
31320: bearing the sacred branch? The objects of her rescue were not to be
31321: sought out by her fancy: they were chosen for her. She yearned towards
31322: the perfect Right, that it might make a throne within her, and rule her
31323: errant will. “What should I do—how should I act now, this very day, if
31324: I could clutch my own pain, and compel it to silence, and think of
31325: those three?”
31326: 
31327: It had taken long for her to come to that question, and there was light
31328: piercing into the room. She opened her curtains, and looked out towards
31329: the bit of road that lay in view, with fields beyond outside the
31330: entrance-gates. On the road there was a man with a bundle on his back
31331: and a woman carrying her baby; in the field she could see figures
31332: moving—perhaps the shepherd with his dog. Far off in the bending sky
31333: was the pearly light; and she felt the largeness of the world and the
31334: manifold wakings of men to labor and endurance. She was a part of that
31335: involuntary, palpitating life, and could neither look out on it from
31336: her luxurious shelter as a mere spectator, nor hide her eyes in selfish
31337: complaining.
31338: 
31339: What she would resolve to do that day did not yet seem quite clear, but
31340: something that she could achieve stirred her as with an approaching
31341: murmur which would soon gather distinctness. She took off the clothes
31342: which seemed to have some of the weariness of a hard watching in them,
31343: and began to make her toilet. Presently she rang for Tantripp, who came
31344: in her dressing-gown.
31345: 
31346: “Why, madam, you’ve never been in bed this blessed night,” burst out
31347: Tantripp, looking first at the bed and then at Dorothea’s face, which
31348: in spite of bathing had the pale cheeks and pink eyelids of a mater
31349: dolorosa. “You’ll kill yourself, you _will_. Anybody might think now
31350: you had a right to give yourself a little comfort.”
31351: 
31352: “Don’t be alarmed, Tantripp,” said Dorothea, smiling. “I have slept; I
31353: am not ill. I shall be glad of a cup of coffee as soon as possible. And
31354: I want you to bring me my new dress; and most likely I shall want my
31355: new bonnet to-day.”
31356: 
31357: “They’ve lain there a month and more ready for you, madam, and most
31358: thankful I shall be to see you with a couple o’ pounds’ worth less of
31359: crape,” said Tantripp, stooping to light the fire. “There’s a reason in
31360: mourning, as I’ve always said; and three folds at the bottom of your
31361: skirt and a plain quilling in your bonnet—and if ever anybody looked
31362: like an angel, it’s you in a net quilling—is what’s consistent for a
31363: second year. At least, that’s _my_ thinking,” ended Tantripp, looking
31364: anxiously at the fire; “and if anybody was to marry me flattering
31365: himself I should wear those hijeous weepers two years for him, he’d be
31366: deceived by his own vanity, that’s all.”
31367: 
31368: “The fire will do, my good Tan,” said Dorothea, speaking as she used to
31369: do in the old Lausanne days, only with a very low voice; “get me the
31370: coffee.”
31371: 
31372: She folded herself in the large chair, and leaned her head against it
31373: in fatigued quiescence, while Tantripp went away wondering at this
31374: strange contrariness in her young mistress—that just the morning when
31375: she had more of a widow’s face than ever, she should have asked for her
31376: lighter mourning which she had waived before. Tantripp would never have
31377: found the clew to this mystery. Dorothea wished to acknowledge that she
31378: had not the less an active life before her because she had buried a
31379: private joy; and the tradition that fresh garments belonged to all
31380: initiation, haunting her mind, made her grasp after even that slight
31381: outward help towards calm resolve. For the resolve was not easy.
31382: 
31383: Nevertheless at eleven o’clock she was walking towards Middlemarch,
31384: having made up her mind that she would make as quietly and unnoticeably
31385: as possible her second attempt to see and save Rosamond.

31391: 
31392: Du Erde warst auch diese Nacht beständig,

31394: Beginnest schon mit Lust mich zu umgeben,

31397: —_Faust:_ 2r Theil.
31398: 
31399: 
31400: When Dorothea was again at Lydgate’s door speaking to Martha, he was in
31401: the room close by with the door ajar, preparing to go out. He heard her
31402: voice, and immediately came to her.
31403: 
31404: “Do you think that Mrs. Lydgate can receive me this morning?” she said,
31405: having reflected that it would be better to leave out all allusion to
31406: her previous visit.
31407: 
31408: “I have no doubt she will,” said Lydgate, suppressing his thought about
31409: Dorothea’s looks, which were as much changed as Rosamond’s, “if you
31410: will be kind enough to come in and let me tell her that you are here.
31411: She has not been very well since you were here yesterday, but she is
31412: better this morning, and I think it is very likely that she will be
31413: cheered by seeing you again.”
31414: 
31415: It was plain that Lydgate, as Dorothea had expected, knew nothing about
31416: the circumstances of her yesterday’s visit; nay, he appeared to imagine
31417: that she had carried it out according to her intention. She had
31418: prepared a little note asking Rosamond to see her, which she would have
31419: given to the servant if he had not been in the way, but now she was in
31420: much anxiety as to the result of his announcement.
31421: 
31422: After leading her into the drawing-room, he paused to take a letter
31423: from his pocket and put it into her hands, saying, “I wrote this last
31424: night, and was going to carry it to Lowick in my ride. When one is
31425: grateful for something too good for common thanks, writing is less
31426: unsatisfactory than speech—one does not at least _hear_ how inadequate
31427: the words are.”
31428: 
31429: Dorothea’s face brightened. “It is I who have most to thank for, since
31430: you have let me take that place. You _have_ consented?” she said,
31431: suddenly doubting.
31432: 
31433: “Yes, the check is going to Bulstrode to-day.”
31434: 
31435: He said no more, but went up-stairs to Rosamond, who had but lately
31436: finished dressing herself, and sat languidly wondering what she should
31437: do next, her habitual industry in small things, even in the days of her
31438: sadness, prompting her to begin some kind of occupation, which she
31439: dragged through slowly or paused in from lack of interest. She looked
31440: ill, but had recovered her usual quietude of manner, and Lydgate had
31441: feared to disturb her by any questions. He had told her of Dorothea’s
31442: letter containing the check, and afterwards he had said, “Ladislaw is
31443: come, Rosy; he sat with me last night; I dare say he will be here again
31444: to-day. I thought he looked rather battered and depressed.” And
31445: Rosamond had made no reply.
31446: 
31447: Now, when he came up, he said to her very gently, “Rosy, dear, Mrs.
31448: Casaubon is come to see you again; you would like to see her, would you
31449: not?” That she colored and gave rather a startled movement did not
31450: surprise him after the agitation produced by the interview yesterday—a
31451: beneficent agitation, he thought, since it seemed to have made her turn
31452: to him again.
31453: 
31454: Rosamond dared not say no. She dared not with a tone of her voice touch
31455: the facts of yesterday. Why had Mrs. Casaubon come again? The answer
31456: was a blank which Rosamond could only fill up with dread, for Will
31457: Ladislaw’s lacerating words had made every thought of Dorothea a fresh
31458: smart to her. Nevertheless, in her new humiliating uncertainty she
31459: dared do nothing but comply. She did not say yes, but she rose and let
31460: Lydgate put a light shawl over her shoulders, while he said, “I am
31461: going out immediately.” Then something crossed her mind which prompted
31462: her to say, “Pray tell Martha not to bring any one else into the
31463: drawing-room.” And Lydgate assented, thinking that he fully understood
31464: this wish. He led her down to the drawing-room door, and then turned
31465: away, observing to himself that he was rather a blundering husband to
31466: be dependent for his wife’s trust in him on the influence of another
31467: woman.
31468: 
31469: Rosamond, wrapping her soft shawl around her as she walked towards
31470: Dorothea, was inwardly wrapping her soul in cold reserve. Had Mrs.
31471: Casaubon come to say anything to her about Will? If so, it was a
31472: liberty that Rosamond resented; and she prepared herself to meet every
31473: word with polite impassibility. Will had bruised her pride too sorely
31474: for her to feel any compunction towards him and Dorothea: her own
31475: injury seemed much the greater. Dorothea was not only the “preferred”
31476: woman, but had also a formidable advantage in being Lydgate’s
31477: benefactor; and to poor Rosamond’s pained confused vision it seemed
31478: that this Mrs. Casaubon—this woman who predominated in all things
31479: concerning her—must have come now with the sense of having the
31480: advantage, and with animosity prompting her to use it. Indeed, not
31481: Rosamond only, but any one else, knowing the outer facts of the case,
31482: and not the simple inspiration on which Dorothea acted, might well have
31483: wondered why she came.
31484: 
31485: Looking like the lovely ghost of herself, her graceful slimness wrapped
31486: in her soft white shawl, the rounded infantine mouth and cheek
31487: inevitably suggesting mildness and innocence, Rosamond paused at three
31488: yards’ distance from her visitor and bowed. But Dorothea, who had taken
31489: off her gloves, from an impulse which she could never resist when she
31490: wanted a sense of freedom, came forward, and with her face full of a
31491: sad yet sweet openness, put out her hand. Rosamond could not avoid
31492: meeting her glance, could not avoid putting her small hand into
31493: Dorothea’s, which clasped it with gentle motherliness; and immediately
31494: a doubt of her own prepossessions began to stir within her. Rosamond’s
31495: eye was quick for faces; she saw that Mrs. Casaubon’s face looked pale
31496: and changed since yesterday, yet gentle, and like the firm softness of
31497: her hand. But Dorothea had counted a little too much on her own
31498: strength: the clearness and intensity of her mental action this morning
31499: were the continuance of a nervous exaltation which made her frame as
31500: dangerously responsive as a bit of finest Venetian crystal; and in
31501: looking at Rosamond, she suddenly found her heart swelling, and was
31502: unable to speak—all her effort was required to keep back tears. She
31503: succeeded in that, and the emotion only passed over her face like the
31504: spirit of a sob; but it added to Rosamond’s impression that Mrs.
31505: Casaubon’s state of mind must be something quite different from what
31506: she had imagined.
31507: 
31508: So they sat down without a word of preface on the two chairs that
31509: happened to be nearest, and happened also to be close together; though
31510: Rosamond’s notion when she first bowed was that she should stay a long
31511: way off from Mrs. Casaubon. But she ceased thinking how anything would
31512: turn out—merely wondering what would come. And Dorothea began to speak
31513: quite simply, gathering firmness as she went on.
31514: 
31515: “I had an errand yesterday which I did not finish; that is why I am
31516: here again so soon. You will not think me too troublesome when I tell
31517: you that I came to talk to you about the injustice that has been shown
31518: towards Mr. Lydgate. It will cheer you—will it not?—to know a great
31519: deal about him, that he may not like to speak about himself just
31520: because it is in his own vindication and to his own honor. You will
31521: like to know that your husband has warm friends, who have not left off
31522: believing in his high character? You will let me speak of this without
31523: thinking that I take a liberty?”
31524: 
31525: The cordial, pleading tones which seemed to flow with generous
31526: heedlessness above all the facts which had filled Rosamond’s mind as
31527: grounds of obstruction and hatred between her and this woman, came as
31528: soothingly as a warm stream over her shrinking fears. Of course Mrs.
31529: Casaubon had the facts in her mind, but she was not going to speak of
31530: anything connected with them. That relief was too great for Rosamond to
31531: feel much else at the moment. She answered prettily, in the new ease of
31532: her soul—
31533: 
31534: “I know you have been very good. I shall like to hear anything you will
31535: say to me about Tertius.”
31536: 
31537: “The day before yesterday,” said Dorothea, “when I had asked him to
31538: come to Lowick to give me his opinion on the affairs of the Hospital,
31539: he told me everything about his conduct and feelings in this sad event
31540: which has made ignorant people cast suspicions on him. The reason he
31541: told me was because I was very bold and asked him. I believed that he
31542: had never acted dishonorably, and I begged him to tell me the history.
31543: He confessed to me that he had never told it before, not even to you,
31544: because he had a great dislike to say, ‘I was not wrong,’ as if that
31545: were proof, when there are guilty people who will say so. The truth is,
31546: he knew nothing of this man Raffles, or that there were any bad secrets
31547: about him; and he thought that Mr. Bulstrode offered him the money
31548: because he repented, out of kindness, of having refused it before. All
31549: his anxiety about his patient was to treat him rightly, and he was a
31550: little uncomfortable that the case did not end as he had expected; but
31551: he thought then and still thinks that there may have been no wrong in
31552: it on any one’s part. And I have told Mr. Farebrother, and Mr. Brooke,
31553: and Sir James Chettam: they all believe in your husband. That will
31554: cheer you, will it not? That will give you courage?”
31555: 
31556: Dorothea’s face had become animated, and as it beamed on Rosamond very
31557: close to her, she felt something like bashful timidity before a
31558: superior, in the presence of this self-forgetful ardor. She said, with
31559: blushing embarrassment, “Thank you: you are very kind.”
31560: 
31561: “And he felt that he had been so wrong not to pour out everything about
31562: this to you. But you will forgive him. It was because he feels so much
31563: more about your happiness than anything else—he feels his life bound
31564: into one with yours, and it hurts him more than anything, that his
31565: misfortunes must hurt you. He could speak to me because I am an
31566: indifferent person. And then I asked him if I might come to see you;
31567: because I felt so much for his trouble and yours. That is why I came
31568: yesterday, and why I am come to-day. Trouble is so hard to bear, is it
31569: not?— How can we live and think that any one has trouble—piercing
31570: trouble—and we could help them, and never try?”
31571: 
31572: Dorothea, completely swayed by the feeling that she was uttering,
31573: forgot everything but that she was speaking from out the heart of her
31574: own trial to Rosamond’s. The emotion had wrought itself more and more
31575: into her utterance, till the tones might have gone to one’s very
31576: marrow, like a low cry from some suffering creature in the darkness.
31577: And she had unconsciously laid her hand again on the little hand that
31578: she had pressed before.
31579: 
31580: Rosamond, with an overmastering pang, as if a wound within her had been
31581: probed, burst into hysterical crying as she had done the day before
31582: when she clung to her husband. Poor Dorothea was feeling a great wave
31583: of her own sorrow returning over her—her thought being drawn to the
31584: possible share that Will Ladislaw might have in Rosamond’s mental
31585: tumult. She was beginning to fear that she should not be able to
31586: suppress herself enough to the end of this meeting, and while her hand
31587: was still resting on Rosamond’s lap, though the hand underneath it was
31588: withdrawn, she was struggling against her own rising sobs. She tried to
31589: master herself with the thought that this might be a turning-point in
31590: three lives—not in her own; no, there the irrevocable had happened,
31591: but—in those three lives which were touching hers with the solemn
31592: neighborhood of danger and distress. The fragile creature who was
31593: crying close to her—there might still be time to rescue her from the
31594: misery of false incompatible bonds; and this moment was unlike any
31595: other: she and Rosamond could never be together again with the same
31596: thrilling consciousness of yesterday within them both. She felt the
31597: relation between them to be peculiar enough to give her a peculiar
31598: influence, though she had no conception that the way in which her own
31599: feelings were involved was fully known to Mrs. Lydgate.
31600: 
31601: It was a newer crisis in Rosamond’s experience than even Dorothea could
31602: imagine: she was under the first great shock that had shattered her
31603: dream-world in which she had been easily confident of herself and
31604: critical of others; and this strange unexpected manifestation of
31605: feeling in a woman whom she had approached with a shrinking aversion
31606: and dread, as one who must necessarily have a jealous hatred towards
31607: her, made her soul totter all the more with a sense that she had been
31608: walking in an unknown world which had just broken in upon her.
31609: 
31610: When Rosamond’s convulsed throat was subsiding into calm, and she
31611: withdrew the handkerchief with which she had been hiding her face, her
31612: eyes met Dorothea’s as helplessly as if they had been blue flowers.
31613: What was the use of thinking about behavior after this crying? And
31614: Dorothea looked almost as childish, with the neglected trace of a
31615: silent tear. Pride was broken down between these two.
31616: 
31617: “We were talking about your husband,” Dorothea said, with some
31618: timidity. “I thought his looks were sadly changed with suffering the
31619: other day. I had not seen him for many weeks before. He said he had
31620: been feeling very lonely in his trial; but I think he would have borne
31621: it all better if he had been able to be quite open with you.”
31622: 
31623: “Tertius is so angry and impatient if I say anything,” said Rosamond,
31624: imagining that he had been complaining of her to Dorothea. “He ought
31625: not to wonder that I object to speak to him on painful subjects.”
31626: 
31627: “It was himself he blamed for not speaking,” said Dorothea. “What he
31628: said of you was, that he could not be happy in doing anything which
31629: made you unhappy—that his marriage was of course a bond which must
31630: affect his choice about everything; and for that reason he refused my
31631: proposal that he should keep his position at the Hospital, because that
31632: would bind him to stay in Middlemarch, and he would not undertake to do
31633: anything which would be painful to you. He could say that to me,
31634: because he knows that I had much trial in my marriage, from my
31635: husband’s illness, which hindered his plans and saddened him; and he
31636: knows that I have felt how hard it is to walk always in fear of hurting
31637: another who is tied to us.”
31638: 
31639: Dorothea waited a little; she had discerned a faint pleasure stealing
31640: over Rosamond’s face. But there was no answer, and she went on, with a
31641: gathering tremor, “Marriage is so unlike everything else. There is
31642: something even awful in the nearness it brings. Even if we loved some
31643: one else better than—than those we were married to, it would be no
31644: use”—poor Dorothea, in her palpitating anxiety, could only seize her
31645: language brokenly—“I mean, marriage drinks up all our power of giving
31646: or getting any blessedness in that sort of love. I know it may be very
31647: dear—but it murders our marriage—and then the marriage stays with us
31648: like a murder—and everything else is gone. And then our husband—if he
31649: loved and trusted us, and we have not helped him, but made a curse in
31650: his life—”
31651: 
31652: Her voice had sunk very low: there was a dread upon her of presuming
31653: too far, and of speaking as if she herself were perfection addressing
31654: error. She was too much preoccupied with her own anxiety, to be aware
31655: that Rosamond was trembling too; and filled with the need to express
31656: pitying fellowship rather than rebuke, she put her hands on Rosamond’s,
31657: and said with more agitated rapidity,—“I know, I know that the feeling
31658: may be very dear—it has taken hold of us unawares—it is so hard, it may
31659: seem like death to part with it—and we are weak—I am weak—”
31660: 
31661: The waves of her own sorrow, from out of which she was struggling to
31662: save another, rushed over Dorothea with conquering force. She stopped
31663: in speechless agitation, not crying, but feeling as if she were being
31664: inwardly grappled. Her face had become of a deathlier paleness, her
31665: lips trembled, and she pressed her hands helplessly on the hands that
31666: lay under them.
31667: 
31668: Rosamond, taken hold of by an emotion stronger than her own—hurried
31669: along in a new movement which gave all things some new, awful,
31670: undefined aspect—could find no words, but involuntarily she put her
31671: lips to Dorothea’s forehead which was very near her, and then for a
31672: minute the two women clasped each other as if they had been in a
31673: shipwreck.
31674: 
31675: “You are thinking what is not true,” said Rosamond, in an eager
31676: half-whisper, while she was still feeling Dorothea’s arms round
31677: her—urged by a mysterious necessity to free herself from something that
31678: oppressed her as if it were blood guiltiness.
31679: 
31680: They moved apart, looking at each other.
31681: 
31682: “When you came in yesterday—it was not as you thought,” said Rosamond
31683: in the same tone.
31684: 
31685: There was a movement of surprised attention in Dorothea. She expected a
31686: vindication of Rosamond herself.
31687: 
31688: “He was telling me how he loved another woman, that I might know he
31689: could never love me,” said Rosamond, getting more and more hurried as
31690: she went on. “And now I think he hates me because—because you mistook
31691: him yesterday. He says it is through me that you will think ill of
31692: him—think that he is a false person. But it shall not be through me. He
31693: has never had any love for me—I know he has not—he has always thought
31694: slightly of me. He said yesterday that no other woman existed for him
31695: beside you. The blame of what happened is entirely mine. He said he
31696: could never explain to you—because of me. He said you could never think
31697: well of him again. But now I have told you, and he cannot reproach me
31698: any more.”
31699: 
31700: Rosamond had delivered her soul under impulses which she had not known
31701: before. She had begun her confession under the subduing influence of
31702: Dorothea’s emotion; and as she went on she had gathered the sense that
31703: she was repelling Will’s reproaches, which were still like a
31704: knife-wound within her.
31705: 
31706: The revulsion of feeling in Dorothea was too strong to be called joy.
31707: It was a tumult in which the terrible strain of the night and morning
31708: made a resistant pain:—she could only perceive that this would be joy
31709: when she had recovered her power of feeling it. Her immediate
31710: consciousness was one of immense sympathy without check; she cared for
31711: Rosamond without struggle now, and responded earnestly to her last
31712: words—
31713: 
31714: “No, he cannot reproach you any more.”
31715: 
31716: With her usual tendency to over-estimate the good in others, she felt a
31717: great outgoing of her heart towards Rosamond, for the generous effort
31718: which had redeemed her from suffering, not counting that the effort was
31719: a reflex of her own energy. After they had been silent a little, she
31720: said—
31721: 
31722: “You are not sorry that I came this morning?”
31723: 
31724: “No, you have been very good to me,” said Rosamond. “I did not think
31725: that you would be so good. I was very unhappy. I am not happy now.
31726: Everything is so sad.”
31727: 
31728: “But better days will come. Your husband will be rightly valued. And he
31729: depends on you for comfort. He loves you best. The worst loss would be
31730: to lose that—and you have not lost it,” said Dorothea.
31731: 
31732: She tried to thrust away the too overpowering thought of her own
31733: relief, lest she should fail to win some sign that Rosamond’s affection
31734: was yearning back towards her husband.
31735: 
31736: “Tertius did not find fault with me, then?” said Rosamond,
31737: understanding now that Lydgate might have said anything to Mrs.
31738: Casaubon, and that she certainly was different from other women.
31739: Perhaps there was a faint taste of jealousy in the question. A smile
31740: began to play over Dorothea’s face as she said—
31741: 
31742: “No, indeed! How could you imagine it?” But here the door opened, and
31743: Lydgate entered.
31744: 
31745: “I am come back in my quality of doctor,” he said. “After I went away,
31746: I was haunted by two pale faces: Mrs. Casaubon looked as much in need
31747: of care as you, Rosy. And I thought that I had not done my duty in
31748: leaving you together; so when I had been to Coleman’s I came home
31749: again. I noticed that you were walking, Mrs. Casaubon, and the sky has
31750: changed—I think we may have rain. May I send some one to order your
31751: carriage to come for you?”
31752: 
31753: “Oh, no! I am strong: I need the walk,” said Dorothea, rising with
31754: animation in her face. “Mrs. Lydgate and I have chatted a great deal,
31755: and it is time for me to go. I have always been accused of being
31756: immoderate and saying too much.”
31757: 
31758: She put out her hand to Rosamond, and they said an earnest, quiet
31759: good-by without kiss or other show of effusion: there had been between
31760: them too much serious emotion for them to use the signs of it
31761: superficially.
31762: 
31763: As Lydgate took her to the door she said nothing of Rosamond, but told
31764: him of Mr. Farebrother and the other friends who had listened with
31765: belief to his story.
31766: 
31767: When he came back to Rosamond, she had already thrown herself on the
31768: sofa, in resigned fatigue.
31769: 
31770: “Well, Rosy,” he said, standing over her, and touching her hair, “what
31771: do you think of Mrs. Casaubon now you have seen so much of her?”
31772: 
31773: “I think she must be better than any one,” said Rosamond, “and she is
31774: very beautiful. If you go to talk to her so often, you will be more
31775: discontented with me than ever!”
31776: 
31777: Lydgate laughed at the “so often.” “But has she made you any less
31778: discontented with me?”
31779: 
31780: “I think she has,” said Rosamond, looking up in his face. “How heavy
31781: your eyes are, Tertius—and do push your hair back.” He lifted up his
31782: large white hand to obey her, and felt thankful for this little mark of
31783: interest in him. Poor Rosamond’s vagrant fancy had come back terribly
31784: scourged—meek enough to nestle under the old despised shelter. And the
31785: shelter was still there: Lydgate had accepted his narrowed lot with sad
31786: resignation. He had chosen this fragile creature, and had taken the
31787: burthen of her life upon his arms. He must walk as he could, carrying
31788: that burthen pitifully.
31789: 
31790:

31792: 
31793: CHAPTER LXXXII.
31794: 
31795: “My grief lies onward and my joy behind.”
31796: —SHAKESPEARE: _Sonnets_.
31797: 
31798: 
31799: Exiles notoriously feed much on hopes, and are unlikely to stay in
31800: banishment unless they are obliged. When Will Ladislaw exiled himself
31801: from Middlemarch he had placed no stronger obstacle to his return than
31802: his own resolve, which was by no means an iron barrier, but simply a
31803: state of mind liable to melt into a minuet with other states of mind,
31804: and to find itself bowing, smiling, and giving place with polite
31805: facility. As the months went on, it had seemed more and more difficult
31806: to him to say why he should not run down to Middlemarch—merely for the
31807: sake of hearing something about Dorothea; and if on such a flying visit
31808: he should chance by some strange coincidence to meet with her, there
31809: was no reason for him to be ashamed of having taken an innocent journey
31810: which he had beforehand supposed that he should not take. Since he was
31811: hopelessly divided from her, he might surely venture into her
31812: neighborhood; and as to the suspicious friends who kept a dragon watch
31813: over her—their opinions seemed less and less important with time and
31814: change of air.
31815: 
31816: And there had come a reason quite irrespective of Dorothea, which
31817: seemed to make a journey to Middlemarch a sort of philanthropic duty.
31818: Will had given a disinterested attention to an intended settlement on a
31819: new plan in the Far West, and the need for funds in order to carry out
31820: a good design had set him on debating with himself whether it would not
31821: be a laudable use to make of his claim on Bulstrode, to urge the
31822: application of that money which had been offered to himself as a means
31823: of carrying out a scheme likely to be largely beneficial. The question
31824: seemed a very dubious one to Will, and his repugnance to again entering
31825: into any relation with the banker might have made him dismiss it
31826: quickly, if there had not arisen in his imagination the probability
31827: that his judgment might be more safely determined by a visit to
31828: Middlemarch.
31829: 
31830: That was the object which Will stated to himself as a reason for coming
31831: down. He had meant to confide in Lydgate, and discuss the money
31832: question with him, and he had meant to amuse himself for the few
31833: evenings of his stay by having a great deal of music and badinage with
31834: fair Rosamond, without neglecting his friends at Lowick Parsonage:—if
31835: the Parsonage was close to the Manor, that was no fault of his. He had
31836: neglected the Farebrothers before his departure, from a proud
31837: resistance to the possible accusation of indirectly seeking interviews
31838: with Dorothea; but hunger tames us, and Will had become very hungry for
31839: the vision of a certain form and the sound of a certain voice. Nothing
31840: had done instead—not the opera, or the converse of zealous politicians,
31841: or the flattering reception (in dim corners) of his new hand in leading
31842: articles.
31843: 
31844: Thus he had come down, foreseeing with confidence how almost everything
31845: would be in his familiar little world; fearing, indeed, that there
31846: would be no surprises in his visit. But he had found that humdrum world
31847: in a terribly dynamic condition, in which even badinage and lyrism had
31848: turned explosive; and the first day of this visit had become the most
31849: fatal epoch of his life. The next morning he felt so harassed with the
31850: nightmare of consequences—he dreaded so much the immediate issues
31851: before him—that seeing while he breakfasted the arrival of the
31852: Riverston coach, he went out hurriedly and took his place on it, that
31853: he might be relieved, at least for a day, from the necessity of doing
31854: or saying anything in Middlemarch. Will Ladislaw was in one of those
31855: tangled crises which are commoner in experience than one might imagine,
31856: from the shallow absoluteness of men’s judgments. He had found Lydgate,
31857: for whom he had the sincerest respect, under circumstances which
31858: claimed his thorough and frankly declared sympathy; and the reason why,
31859: in spite of that claim, it would have been better for Will to have
31860: avoided all further intimacy, or even contact, with Lydgate, was
31861: precisely of the kind to make such a course appear impossible. To a
31862: creature of Will’s susceptible temperament—without any neutral region
31863: of indifference in his nature, ready to turn everything that befell him
31864: into the collisions of a passionate drama—the revelation that Rosamond
31865: had made her happiness in any way dependent on him was a difficulty
31866: which his outburst of rage towards her had immeasurably increased for
31867: him. He hated his own cruelty, and yet he dreaded to show the fulness
31868: of his relenting: he must go to her again; the friendship could not be
31869: put to a sudden end; and her unhappiness was a power which he dreaded.
31870: And all the while there was no more foretaste of enjoyment in the life
31871: before him than if his limbs had been lopped off and he was making his
31872: fresh start on crutches. In the night he had debated whether he should
31873: not get on the coach, not for Riverston, but for London, leaving a note
31874: to Lydgate which would give a makeshift reason for his retreat. But
31875: there were strong cords pulling him back from that abrupt departure:
31876: the blight on his happiness in thinking of Dorothea, the crushing of
31877: that chief hope which had remained in spite of the acknowledged
31878: necessity for renunciation, was too fresh a misery for him to resign
31879: himself to it and go straightway into a distance which was also
31880: despair.
31881: 
31882: Thus he did nothing more decided than taking the Riverston coach. He
31883: came back again by it while it was still daylight, having made up his
31884: mind that he must go to Lydgate’s that evening. The Rubicon, we know,
31885: was a very insignificant stream to look at; its significance lay
31886: entirely in certain invisible conditions. Will felt as if he were
31887: forced to cross his small boundary ditch, and what he saw beyond it was
31888: not empire, but discontented subjection.
31889: 
31890: But it is given to us sometimes even in our every-day life to witness
31891: the saving influence of a noble nature, the divine efficacy of rescue
31892: that may lie in a self-subduing act of fellowship. If Dorothea, after
31893: her night’s anguish, had not taken that walk to Rosamond—why, she
31894: perhaps would have been a woman who gained a higher character for
31895: discretion, but it would certainly not have been as well for those
31896: three who were on one hearth in Lydgate’s house at half-past seven that
31897: evening.
31898: 
31899: Rosamond had been prepared for Will’s visit, and she received him with
31900: a languid coldness which Lydgate accounted for by her nervous
31901: exhaustion, of which he could not suppose that it had any relation to
31902: Will. And when she sat in silence bending over a bit of work, he
31903: innocently apologized for her in an indirect way by begging her to lean
31904: backward and rest. Will was miserable in the necessity for playing the
31905: part of a friend who was making his first appearance and greeting to
31906: Rosamond, while his thoughts were busy about her feeling since that
31907: scene of yesterday, which seemed still inexorably to enclose them both,
31908: like the painful vision of a double madness. It happened that nothing
31909: called Lydgate out of the room; but when Rosamond poured out the tea,
31910: and Will came near to fetch it, she placed a tiny bit of folded paper
31911: in his saucer. He saw it and secured it quickly, but as he went back to
31912: his inn he had no eagerness to unfold the paper. What Rosamond had
31913: written to him would probably deepen the painful impressions of the
31914: evening. Still, he opened and read it by his bed-candle. There were
31915: only these few words in her neatly flowing hand:—
31916: 
31917: “I have told Mrs. Casaubon. She is not under any mistake about you. I
31918: told her because she came to see me and was very kind. You will have
31919: nothing to reproach me with now. I shall not have made any difference
31920: to you.”
31921: 
31922: The effect of these words was not quite all gladness. As Will dwelt on
31923: them with excited imagination, he felt his cheeks and ears burning at
31924: the thought of what had occurred between Dorothea and Rosamond—at the
31925: uncertainty how far Dorothea might still feel her dignity wounded in
31926: having an explanation of his conduct offered to her. There might still
31927: remain in her mind a changed association with him which made an
31928: irremediable difference—a lasting flaw. With active fancy he wrought
31929: himself into a state of doubt little more easy than that of the man who
31930: has escaped from wreck by night and stands on unknown ground in the
31931: darkness. Until that wretched yesterday—except the moment of vexation
31932: long ago in the very same room and in the very same presence—all their
31933: vision, all their thought of each other, had been as in a world apart,
31934: where the sunshine fell on tall white lilies, where no evil lurked, and
31935: no other soul entered. But now—would Dorothea meet him in that world
31936: again?

31941: CHAPTER LXXXIII.
31942: 
31943: “And now good-morrow to our waking souls
31944: Which watch not one another out of fear;
31945: For love all love of other sights controls,
31946: And makes one little room, an everywhere.”
31947: —DR. DONNE.
31948: 
31949: 
31950: On the second morning after Dorothea’s visit to Rosamond, she had had
31951: two nights of sound sleep, and had not only lost all traces of fatigue,
31952: but felt as if she had a great deal of superfluous strength—that is to
31953: say, more strength than she could manage to concentrate on any
31954: occupation. The day before, she had taken long walks outside the
31955: grounds, and had paid two visits to the Parsonage; but she never in her
31956: life told any one the reason why she spent her time in that fruitless
31957: manner, and this morning she was rather angry with herself for her
31958: childish restlessness. To-day was to be spent quite differently. What
31959: was there to be done in the village? Oh dear! nothing. Everybody was
31960: well and had flannel; nobody’s pig had died; and it was Saturday
31961: morning, when there was a general scrubbing of doors and door-stones,
31962: and when it was useless to go into the school. But there were various
31963: subjects that Dorothea was trying to get clear upon, and she resolved
31964: to throw herself energetically into the gravest of all. She sat down in
31965: the library before her particular little heap of books on political
31966: economy and kindred matters, out of which she was trying to get light
31967: as to the best way of spending money so as not to injure one’s
31968: neighbors, or—what comes to the same thing—so as to do them the most
31969: good. Here was a weighty subject which, if she could but lay hold of
31970: it, would certainly keep her mind steady. Unhappily her mind slipped
31971: off it for a whole hour; and at the end she found herself reading
31972: sentences twice over with an intense consciousness of many things, but
31973: not of any one thing contained in the text. This was hopeless. Should
31974: she order the carriage and drive to Tipton? No; for some reason or
31975: other she preferred staying at Lowick. But her vagrant mind must be
31976: reduced to order: there was an art in self-discipline; and she walked
31977: round and round the brown library considering by what sort of manoeuvre
31978: she could arrest her wandering thoughts. Perhaps a mere task was the
31979: best means—something to which she must go doggedly. Was there not the
31980: geography of Asia Minor, in which her slackness had often been rebuked
31981: by Mr. Casaubon? She went to the cabinet of maps and unrolled one: this
31982: morning she might make herself finally sure that Paphlagonia was not on
31983: the Levantine coast, and fix her total darkness about the Chalybes
31984: firmly on the shores of the Euxine. A map was a fine thing to study
31985: when you were disposed to think of something else, being made up of
31986: names that would turn into a chime if you went back upon them. Dorothea
31987: set earnestly to work, bending close to her map, and uttering the names
31988: in an audible, subdued tone, which often got into a chime. She looked
31989: amusingly girlish after all her deep experience—nodding her head and
31990: marking the names off on her fingers, with a little pursing of her lip,
31991: and now and then breaking off to put her hands on each side of her face
31992: and say, “Oh dear! oh dear!”
31993: 
31994: There was no reason why this should end any more than a merry-go-round;
31995: but it was at last interrupted by the opening of the door and the
31996: announcement of Miss Noble.
31997: 
31998: The little old lady, whose bonnet hardly reached Dorothea’s shoulder,
31999: was warmly welcomed, but while her hand was being pressed she made many
32000: of her beaver-like noises, as if she had something difficult to say.
32001: 
32002: “Do sit down,” said Dorothea, rolling a chair forward. “Am I wanted for
32003: anything? I shall be so glad if I can do anything.”
32004: 
32005: “I will not stay,” said Miss Noble, putting her hand into her small
32006: basket, and holding some article inside it nervously; “I have left a
32007: friend in the churchyard.” She lapsed into her inarticulate sounds, and
32008: unconsciously drew forth the article which she was fingering. It was
32009: the tortoise-shell lozenge-box, and Dorothea felt the color mounting to
32010: her cheeks.
32011: 
32012: “Mr. Ladislaw,” continued the timid little woman. “He fears he has
32013: offended you, and has begged me to ask if you will see him for a few
32014: minutes.”
32015: 
32016: Dorothea did not answer on the instant: it was crossing her mind that
32017: she could not receive him in this library, where her husband’s
32018: prohibition seemed to dwell. She looked towards the window. Could she
32019: go out and meet him in the grounds? The sky was heavy, and the trees
32020: had begun to shiver as at a coming storm. Besides, she shrank from
32021: going out to him.
32022: 
32023: “Do see him, Mrs. Casaubon,” said Miss Noble, pathetically; “else I
32024: must go back and say No, and that will hurt him.”
32025: 
32026: “Yes, I will see him,” said Dorothea. “Pray tell him to come.”
32027: 
32028: What else was there to be done? There was nothing that she longed for
32029: at that moment except to see Will: the possibility of seeing him had
32030: thrust itself insistently between her and every other object; and yet
32031: she had a throbbing excitement like an alarm upon her—a sense that she
32032: was doing something daringly defiant for his sake.
32033: 
32034: When the little lady had trotted away on her mission, Dorothea stood in
32035: the middle of the library with her hands falling clasped before her,
32036: making no attempt to compose herself in an attitude of dignified
32037: unconsciousness. What she was least conscious of just then was her own
32038: body: she was thinking of what was likely to be in Will’s mind, and of
32039: the hard feelings that others had had about him. How could any duty
32040: bind her to hardness? Resistance to unjust dispraise had mingled with
32041: her feeling for him from the very first, and now in the rebound of her
32042: heart after her anguish the resistance was stronger than ever. “If I
32043: love him too much it is because he has been used so ill:”—there was a
32044: voice within her saying this to some imagined audience in the library,
32045: when the door was opened, and she saw Will before her.
32046: 
32047: She did not move, and he came towards her with more doubt and timidity
32048: in his face than she had ever seen before. He was in a state of
32049: uncertainty which made him afraid lest some look or word of his should
32050: condemn him to a new distance from her; and Dorothea was afraid of her
32051: _own_ emotion. She looked as if there were a spell upon her, keeping
32052: her motionless and hindering her from unclasping her hands, while some
32053: intense, grave yearning was imprisoned within her eyes. Seeing that she
32054: did not put out her hand as usual, Will paused a yard from her and said
32055: with embarrassment, “I am so grateful to you for seeing me.”
32056: 
32057: “I wanted to see you,” said Dorothea, having no other words at command.
32058: It did not occur to her to sit down, and Will did not give a cheerful
32059: interpretation to this queenly way of receiving him; but he went on to
32060: say what he had made up his mind to say.
32061: 
32062: “I fear you think me foolish and perhaps wrong for coming back so soon.
32063: I have been punished for my impatience. You know—every one knows now—a
32064: painful story about my parentage. I knew of it before I went away, and
32065: I always meant to tell you of it if—if we ever met again.”
32066: 
32067: There was a slight movement in Dorothea, and she unclasped her hands,
32068: but immediately folded them over each other.
32069: 
32070: “But the affair is matter of gossip now,” Will continued. “I wished you
32071: to know that something connected with it—something which happened
32072: before I went away, helped to bring me down here again. At least I
32073: thought it excused my coming. It was the idea of getting Bulstrode to
32074: apply some money to a public purpose—some money which he had thought of
32075: giving me. Perhaps it is rather to Bulstrode’s credit that he privately
32076: offered me compensation for an old injury: he offered to give me a good
32077: income to make amends; but I suppose you know the disagreeable story?”
32078: 
32079: Will looked doubtfully at Dorothea, but his manner was gathering some
32080: of the defiant courage with which he always thought of this fact in his
32081: destiny. He added, “You know that it must be altogether painful to me.”
32082: 
32083: “Yes—yes—I know,” said Dorothea, hastily.
32084: 
32085: “I did not choose to accept an income from such a source. I was sure
32086: that you would not think well of me if I did so,” said Will. Why should
32087: he mind saying anything of that sort to her now? She knew that he had
32088: avowed his love for her. “I felt that”—he broke off, nevertheless.
32089: 
32090: “You acted as I should have expected you to act,” said Dorothea, her
32091: face brightening and her head becoming a little more erect on its
32092: beautiful stem.
32093: 
32094: “I did not believe that you would let any circumstance of my birth
32095: create a prejudice in you against me, though it was sure to do so in
32096: others,” said Will, shaking his head backward in his old way, and
32097: looking with a grave appeal into her eyes.
32098: 
32099: “If it were a new hardship it would be a new reason for me to cling to
32100: you,” said Dorothea, fervidly. “Nothing could have changed me but—” her
32101: heart was swelling, and it was difficult to go on; she made a great
32102: effort over herself to say in a low tremulous voice, “but thinking that
32103: you were different—not so good as I had believed you to be.”
32104: 
32105: “You are sure to believe me better than I am in everything but one,”
32106: said Will, giving way to his own feeling in the evidence of hers. “I
32107: mean, in my truth to you. When I thought you doubted of that, I didn’t
32108: care about anything that was left. I thought it was all over with me,
32109: and there was nothing to try for—only things to endure.”
32110: 
32111: “I don’t doubt you any longer,” said Dorothea, putting out her hand; a
32112: vague fear for him impelling her unutterable affection.
32113: 
32114: He took her hand and raised it to his lips with something like a sob.
32115: But he stood with his hat and gloves in the other hand, and might have
32116: done for the portrait of a Royalist. Still it was difficult to loose
32117: the hand, and Dorothea, withdrawing it in a confusion that distressed
32118: her, looked and moved away.
32119: 
32120: “See how dark the clouds have become, and how the trees are tossed,”
32121: she said, walking towards the window, yet speaking and moving with only
32122: a dim sense of what she was doing.
32123: 
32124: Will followed her at a little distance, and leaned against the tall
32125: back of a leather chair, on which he ventured now to lay his hat and
32126: gloves, and free himself from the intolerable durance of formality to
32127: which he had been for the first time condemned in Dorothea’s presence.
32128: It must be confessed that he felt very happy at that moment leaning on
32129: the chair. He was not much afraid of anything that she might feel now.
32130: 
32131: They stood silent, not looking at each other, but looking at the
32132: evergreens which were being tossed, and were showing the pale underside
32133: of their leaves against the blackening sky. Will never enjoyed the
32134: prospect of a storm so much: it delivered him from the necessity of
32135: going away. Leaves and little branches were hurled about, and the
32136: thunder was getting nearer. The light was more and more sombre, but
32137: there came a flash of lightning which made them start and look at each
32138: other, and then smile. Dorothea began to say what she had been thinking
32139: of.
32140: 
32141: “That was a wrong thing for you to say, that you would have had nothing
32142: to try for. If we had lost our own chief good, other people’s good
32143: would remain, and that is worth trying for. Some can be happy. I seemed
32144: to see that more clearly than ever, when I was the most wretched. I can
32145: hardly think how I could have borne the trouble, if that feeling had
32146: not come to me to make strength.”
32147: 
32148: “You have never felt the sort of misery I felt,” said Will; “the misery
32149: of knowing that you must despise me.”
32150: 
32151: “But I have felt worse—it was worse to think ill—” Dorothea had begun
32152: impetuously, but broke off.
32153: 
32154: Will colored. He had the sense that whatever she said was uttered in
32155: the vision of a fatality that kept them apart. He was silent a moment,
32156: and then said passionately—
32157: 
32158: “We may at least have the comfort of speaking to each other without
32159: disguise. Since I must go away—since we must always be divided—you may
32160: think of me as one on the brink of the grave.”
32161: 
32162: While he was speaking there came a vivid flash of lightning which lit
32163: each of them up for the other—and the light seemed to be the terror of
32164: a hopeless love. Dorothea darted instantaneously from the window; Will
32165: followed her, seizing her hand with a spasmodic movement; and so they
32166: stood, with their hands clasped, like two children, looking out on the
32167: storm, while the thunder gave a tremendous crack and roll above them,
32168: and the rain began to pour down. Then they turned their faces towards
32169: each other, with the memory of his last words in them, and they did not
32170: loose each other’s hands.
32171: 
32172: “There is no hope for me,” said Will. “Even if you loved me as well as
32173: I love you—even if I were everything to you—I shall most likely always
32174: be very poor: on a sober calculation, one can count on nothing but a
32175: creeping lot. It is impossible for us ever to belong to each other. It
32176: is perhaps base of me to have asked for a word from you. I meant to go
32177: away into silence, but I have not been able to do what I meant.”
32178: 
32179: “Don’t be sorry,” said Dorothea, in her clear tender tones. “I would
32180: rather share all the trouble of our parting.”
32181: 
32182: Her lips trembled, and so did his. It was never known which lips were
32183: the first to move towards the other lips; but they kissed tremblingly,
32184: and then they moved apart.
32185: 
32186: The rain was dashing against the window-panes as if an angry spirit
32187: were within it, and behind it was the great swoop of the wind; it was
32188: one of those moments in which both the busy and the idle pause with a
32189: certain awe.
32190: 
32191: Dorothea sat down on the seat nearest to her, a long low ottoman in the
32192: middle of the room, and with her hands folded over each other on her
32193: lap, looked at the drear outer world. Will stood still an instant
32194: looking at her, then seated himself beside her, and laid his hand on
32195: hers, which turned itself upward to be clasped. They sat in that way
32196: without looking at each other, until the rain abated and began to fall
32197: in stillness. Each had been full of thoughts which neither of them
32198: could begin to utter.
32199: 
32200: But when the rain was quiet, Dorothea turned to look at Will. With
32201: passionate exclamation, as if some torture screw were threatening him,
32202: he started up and said, “It is impossible!”
32203: 
32204: He went and leaned on the back of the chair again, and seemed to be
32205: battling with his own anger, while she looked towards him sadly.
32206: 
32207: “It is as fatal as a murder or any other horror that divides people,”
32208: he burst out again; “it is more intolerable—to have our life maimed by
32209: petty accidents.”
32210: 
32211: “No—don’t say that—your life need not be maimed,” said Dorothea,
32212: gently.
32213: 
32214: “Yes, it must,” said Will, angrily. “It is cruel of you to speak in
32215: that way—as if there were any comfort. You may see beyond the misery of
32216: it, but I don’t. It is unkind—it is throwing back my love for you as if
32217: it were a trifle, to speak in that way in the face of the fact. We can
32218: never be married.”
32219: 
32220: “Some time—we might,” said Dorothea, in a trembling voice.
32221: 
32222: “When?” said Will, bitterly. “What is the use of counting on any
32223: success of mine? It is a mere toss up whether I shall ever do more than
32224: keep myself decently, unless I choose to sell myself as a mere pen and
32225: a mouthpiece. I can see that clearly enough. I could not offer myself
32226: to any woman, even if she had no luxuries to renounce.”
32227: 
32228: There was silence. Dorothea’s heart was full of something that she
32229: wanted to say, and yet the words were too difficult. She was wholly
32230: possessed by them: at that moment debate was mute within her. And it
32231: was very hard that she could not say what she wanted to say. Will was
32232: looking out of the window angrily. If he would have looked at her and
32233: not gone away from her side, she thought everything would have been
32234: easier. At last he turned, still resting against the chair, and
32235: stretching his hand automatically towards his hat, said with a sort of
32236: exasperation, “Good-by.”
32237: 
32238: “Oh, I cannot bear it—my heart will break,” said Dorothea, starting
32239: from her seat, the flood of her young passion bearing down all the
32240: obstructions which had kept her silent—the great tears rising and
32241: falling in an instant: “I don’t mind about poverty—I hate my wealth.”
32242: 
32243: In an instant Will was close to her and had his arms round her, but she
32244: drew her head back and held his away gently that she might go on
32245: speaking, her large tear-filled eyes looking at his very simply, while
32246: she said in a sobbing childlike way, “We could live quite well on my
32247: own fortune—it is too much—seven hundred a-year—I want so little—no new
32248: clothes—and I will learn what everything costs.”
32249:

32252: 
32253: CHAPTER LXXXIV.
32254: 
32255: “Though it be songe of old and yonge,
32256:     That I sholde be to blame,
32257: Theyrs be the charge, that spoke so large
32258:     In hurtynge of my name.”
32259: —_The Not-Browne Mayde_.
32260: 
32261: 
32262: It was just after the Lords had thrown out the Reform Bill: that
32263: explains how Mr. Cadwallader came to be walking on the slope of the
32264: lawn near the great conservatory at Freshitt Hall, holding the “Times”
32265: in his hands behind him, while he talked with a trout-fisher’s
32266: dispassionateness about the prospects of the country to Sir James
32267: Chettam. Mrs. Cadwallader, the Dowager Lady Chettam, and Celia were
32268: sometimes seated on garden-chairs, sometimes walking to meet little
32269: Arthur, who was being drawn in his chariot, and, as became the
32270: infantine Bouddha, was sheltered by his sacred umbrella with handsome
32271: silken fringe.
32272: 
32273: The ladies also talked politics, though more fitfully. Mrs. Cadwallader
32274: was strong on the intended creation of peers: she had it for certain
32275: from her cousin that Truberry had gone over to the other side entirely
32276: at the instigation of his wife, who had scented peerages in the air
32277: from the very first introduction of the Reform question, and would sign
32278: her soul away to take precedence of her younger sister, who had married
32279: a baronet. Lady Chettam thought that such conduct was very
32280: reprehensible, and remembered that Mrs. Truberry’s mother was a Miss
32281: Walsingham of Melspring. Celia confessed it was nicer to be “Lady” than
32282: “Mrs.,” and that Dodo never minded about precedence if she could have
32283: her own way. Mrs. Cadwallader held that it was a poor satisfaction to
32284: take precedence when everybody about you knew that you had not a drop
32285: of good blood in your veins; and Celia again, stopping to look at
32286: Arthur, said, “It would be very nice, though, if he were a Viscount—and
32287: his lordship’s little tooth coming through! He might have been, if
32288: James had been an Earl.”
32289: 
32290: “My dear Celia,” said the Dowager, “James’s title is worth far more
32291: than any new earldom. I never wished his father to be anything else
32292: than Sir James.”
32293: 
32294: “Oh, I only meant about Arthur’s little tooth,” said Celia,
32295: comfortably. “But see, here is my uncle coming.”
32296: 
32297: She tripped off to meet her uncle, while Sir James and Mr. Cadwallader
32298: came forward to make one group with the ladies. Celia had slipped her
32299: arm through her uncle’s, and he patted her hand with a rather
32300: melancholy “Well, my dear!” As they approached, it was evident that Mr.
32301: Brooke was looking dejected, but this was fully accounted for by the
32302: state of politics; and as he was shaking hands all round without more
32303: greeting than a “Well, you’re all here, you know,” the Rector said,
32304: laughingly—
32305: 
32306: “Don’t take the throwing out of the Bill so much to heart, Brooke;
32307: you’ve got all the riff-raff of the country on your side.”
32308: 
32309: “The Bill, eh? ah!” said Mr. Brooke, with a mild distractedness of
32310: manner. “Thrown out, you know, eh? The Lords are going too far, though.
32311: They’ll have to pull up. Sad news, you know. I mean, here at home—sad
32312: news. But you must not blame me, Chettam.”
32313: 
32314: “What is the matter?” said Sir James. “Not another gamekeeper shot, I
32315: hope? It’s what I should expect, when a fellow like Trapping Bass is
32316: let off so easily.”
32317: 
32318: “Gamekeeper? No. Let us go in; I can tell you all in the house, you
32319: know,” said Mr. Brooke, nodding at the Cadwalladers, to show that he
32320: included them in his confidence. “As to poachers like Trapping Bass,
32321: you know, Chettam,” he continued, as they were entering, “when you are
32322: a magistrate, you’ll not find it so easy to commit. Severity is all
32323: very well, but it’s a great deal easier when you’ve got somebody to do
32324: it for you. You have a soft place in your heart yourself, you
32325: know—you’re not a Draco, a Jeffreys, that sort of thing.”
32326: 
32327: Mr. Brooke was evidently in a state of nervous perturbation. When he
32328: had something painful to tell, it was usually his way to introduce it
32329: among a number of disjointed particulars, as if it were a medicine that
32330: would get a milder flavor by mixing. He continued his chat with Sir
32331: James about the poachers until they were all seated, and Mrs.
32332: Cadwallader, impatient of this drivelling, said—
32333: 
32334: “I’m dying to know the sad news. The gamekeeper is not shot: that is
32335: settled. What is it, then?”
32336: 
32337: “Well, it’s a very trying thing, you know,” said Mr. Brooke. “I’m glad
32338: you and the Rector are here; it’s a family matter—but you will help us
32339: all to bear it, Cadwallader. I’ve got to break it to you, my dear.”
32340: Here Mr. Brooke looked at Celia—“You’ve no notion what it is, you know.
32341: And, Chettam, it will annoy you uncommonly—but, you see, you have not
32342: been able to hinder it, any more than I have. There’s something
32343: singular in things: they come round, you know.”
32344: 
32345: “It must be about Dodo,” said Celia, who had been used to think of her
32346: sister as the dangerous part of the family machinery. She had seated
32347: herself on a low stool against her husband’s knee.
32348: 
32349: “For God’s sake let us hear what it is!” said Sir James.
32350: 
32351: “Well, you know, Chettam, I couldn’t help Casaubon’s will: it was a
32352: sort of will to make things worse.”
32353: 
32354: “Exactly,” said Sir James, hastily. “But _what_ is worse?”
32355: 
32356: “Dorothea is going to be married again, you know,” said Mr. Brooke,
32357: nodding towards Celia, who immediately looked up at her husband with a
32358: frightened glance, and put her hand on his knee. Sir James was almost
32359: white with anger, but he did not speak.
32360: 
32361: “Merciful heaven!” said Mrs. Cadwallader. “Not to _young_ Ladislaw?”
32362: 
32363: Mr. Brooke nodded, saying, “Yes; to Ladislaw,” and then fell into a
32364: prudential silence.
32365: 
32366: “You see, Humphrey!” said Mrs. Cadwallader, waving her arm towards her
32367: husband. “Another time you will admit that I have some foresight; or
32368: rather you will contradict me and be just as blind as ever. _You_
32369: supposed that the young gentleman was gone out of the country.”
32370: 
32371: “So he might be, and yet come back,” said the Rector, quietly.
32372: 
32373: “When did you learn this?” said Sir James, not liking to hear any one
32374: else speak, though finding it difficult to speak himself.
32375: 
32376: “Yesterday,” said Mr. Brooke, meekly. “I went to Lowick. Dorothea sent
32377: for me, you know. It had come about quite suddenly—neither of them had
32378: any idea two days ago—not any idea, you know. There’s something
32379: singular in things. But Dorothea is quite determined—it is no use
32380: opposing. I put it strongly to her. I did my duty, Chettam. But she can
32381: act as she likes, you know.”
32382: 
32383: “It would have been better if I had called him out and shot him a year
32384: ago,” said Sir James, not from bloody-mindedness, but because he needed
32385: something strong to say.
32386: 
32387: “Really, James, that would have been very disagreeable,” said Celia.
32388: 
32389: “Be reasonable, Chettam. Look at the affair more quietly,” said Mr.
32390: Cadwallader, sorry to see his good-natured friend so overmastered by
32391: anger.
32392: 
32393: “That is not so very easy for a man of any dignity—with any sense of
32394: right—when the affair happens to be in his own family,” said Sir James,
32395: still in his white indignation. “It is perfectly scandalous. If
32396: Ladislaw had had a spark of honor he would have gone out of the country
32397: at once, and never shown his face in it again. However, I am not
32398: surprised. The day after Casaubon’s funeral I said what ought to be
32399: done. But I was not listened to.”
32400: 
32401: “You wanted what was impossible, you know, Chettam,” said Mr. Brooke.
32402: “You wanted him shipped off. I told you Ladislaw was not to be done as
32403: we liked with: he had his ideas. He was a remarkable fellow—I always
32404: said he was a remarkable fellow.”
32405: 
32406: “Yes,” said Sir James, unable to repress a retort, “it is rather a pity
32407: you formed that high opinion of him. We are indebted to that for his
32408: being lodged in this neighborhood. We are indebted to that for seeing a
32409: woman like Dorothea degrading herself by marrying him.” Sir James made
32410: little stoppages between his clauses, the words not coming easily. “A
32411: man so marked out by her husband’s will, that delicacy ought to have
32412: forbidden her from seeing him again—who takes her out of her proper
32413: rank—into poverty—has the meanness to accept such a sacrifice—has
32414: always had an objectionable position—a bad origin—and, _I believe_, is
32415: a man of little principle and light character. That is my opinion.” Sir
32416: James ended emphatically, turning aside and crossing his leg.
32417: 
32418: “I pointed everything out to her,” said Mr. Brooke, apologetically—“I
32419: mean the poverty, and abandoning her position. I said, ‘My dear, you
32420: don’t know what it is to live on seven hundred a-year, and have no
32421: carriage, and that kind of thing, and go amongst people who don’t know
32422: who you are.’ I put it strongly to her. But I advise you to talk to
32423: Dorothea herself. The fact is, she has a dislike to Casaubon’s
32424: property. You will hear what she says, you know.”
32425: 
32426: “No—excuse me—I shall not,” said Sir James, with more coolness. “I
32427: cannot bear to see her again; it is too painful. It hurts me too much
32428: that a woman like Dorothea should have done what is wrong.”
32429: 
32430: “Be just, Chettam,” said the easy, large-lipped Rector, who objected to
32431: all this unnecessary discomfort. “Mrs. Casaubon may be acting
32432: imprudently: she is giving up a fortune for the sake of a man, and we
32433: men have so poor an opinion of each other that we can hardly call a
32434: woman wise who does that. But I think you should not condemn it as a
32435: wrong action, in the strict sense of the word.”
32436: 
32437: “Yes, I do,” answered Sir James. “I think that Dorothea commits a wrong
32438: action in marrying Ladislaw.”
32439: 
32440: “My dear fellow, we are rather apt to consider an act wrong because it
32441: is unpleasant to us,” said the Rector, quietly. Like many men who take
32442: life easily, he had the knack of saying a home truth occasionally to
32443: those who felt themselves virtuously out of temper. Sir James took out
32444: his handkerchief and began to bite the corner.
32445: 
32446: “It is very dreadful of Dodo, though,” said Celia, wishing to justify
32447: her husband. “She said she _never would_ marry again—not anybody at
32448: all.”
32449: 
32450: “I heard her say the same thing myself,” said Lady Chettam,
32451: majestically, as if this were royal evidence.
32452: 
32453: “Oh, there is usually a silent exception in such cases,” said Mrs.
32454: Cadwallader. “The only wonder to me is, that any of you are surprised.
32455: You did nothing to hinder it. If you would have had Lord Triton down
32456: here to woo her with his philanthropy, he might have carried her off
32457: before the year was over. There was no safety in anything else. Mr.
32458: Casaubon had prepared all this as beautifully as possible. He made
32459: himself disagreeable—or it pleased God to make him so—and then he dared
32460: her to contradict him. It’s the way to make any trumpery tempting, to
32461: ticket it at a high price in that way.”
32462: 
32463: “I don’t know what you mean by wrong, Cadwallader,” said Sir James,
32464: still feeling a little stung, and turning round in his chair towards
32465: the Rector. “He’s not a man we can take into the family. At least, I
32466: must speak for myself,” he continued, carefully keeping his eyes off
32467: Mr. Brooke. “I suppose others will find his society too pleasant to
32468: care about the propriety of the thing.”
32469: 
32470: “Well, you know, Chettam,” said Mr. Brooke, good-humoredly, nursing his
32471: leg, “I can’t turn my back on Dorothea. I must be a father to her up to
32472: a certain point. I said, ‘My dear, I won’t refuse to give you away.’ I
32473: had spoken strongly before. But I can cut off the entail, you know. It
32474: will cost money and be troublesome; but I can do it, you know.”
32475: 
32476: Mr. Brooke nodded at Sir James, and felt that he was both showing his
32477: own force of resolution and propitiating what was just in the Baronet’s
32478: vexation. He had hit on a more ingenious mode of parrying than he was
32479: aware of. He had touched a motive of which Sir James was ashamed. The
32480: mass of his feeling about Dorothea’s marriage to Ladislaw was due
32481: partly to excusable prejudice, or even justifiable opinion, partly to a
32482: jealous repugnance hardly less in Ladislaw’s case than in Casaubon’s.
32483: He was convinced that the marriage was a fatal one for Dorothea. But
32484: amid that mass ran a vein of which he was too good and honorable a man
32485: to like the avowal even to himself: it was undeniable that the union of
32486: the two estates—Tipton and Freshitt—lying charmingly within a
32487: ring-fence, was a prospect that flattered him for his son and heir.
32488: Hence when Mr. Brooke noddingly appealed to that motive, Sir James felt
32489: a sudden embarrassment; there was a stoppage in his throat; he even
32490: blushed. He had found more words than usual in the first jet of his
32491: anger, but Mr. Brooke’s propitiation was more clogging to his tongue
32492: than Mr. Cadwallader’s caustic hint.
32493: 
32494: But Celia was glad to have room for speech after her uncle’s suggestion
32495: of the marriage ceremony, and she said, though with as little eagerness
32496: of manner as if the question had turned on an invitation to dinner, “Do
32497: you mean that Dodo is going to be married directly, uncle?”
32498: 
32499: “In three weeks, you know,” said Mr. Brooke, helplessly. “I can do
32500: nothing to hinder it, Cadwallader,” he added, turning for a little
32501: countenance toward the Rector, who said—
32502: 
32503: “_I_ should not make any fuss about it. If she likes to be poor, that
32504: is her affair. Nobody would have said anything if she had married the
32505: young fellow because he was rich. Plenty of beneficed clergy are poorer
32506: than they will be. Here is Elinor,” continued the provoking husband;
32507: “she vexed her friends by me: I had hardly a thousand a-year—I was a
32508: lout—nobody could see anything in me—my shoes were not the right
32509: cut—all the men wondered how a woman could like me. Upon my word, I
32510: must take Ladislaw’s part until I hear more harm of him.”
32511: 
32512: “Humphrey, that is all sophistry, and you know it,” said his wife.
32513: “Everything is all one—that is the beginning and end with you. As if
32514: you had not been a Cadwallader! Does any one suppose that I would have
32515: taken such a monster as you by any other name?”
32516: 
32517: “And a clergyman too,” observed Lady Chettam with approbation. “Elinor
32518: cannot be said to have descended below her rank. It is difficult to say
32519: what Mr. Ladislaw is, eh, James?”
32520: 
32521: Sir James gave a small grunt, which was less respectful than his usual
32522: mode of answering his mother. Celia looked up at him like a thoughtful
32523: kitten.
32524: 
32525: “It must be admitted that his blood is a frightful mixture!” said Mrs.
32526: Cadwallader. “The Casaubon cuttle-fish fluid to begin with, and then a
32527: rebellious Polish fiddler or dancing-master, was it?—and then an old
32528: clo—”
32529: 
32530: “Nonsense, Elinor,” said the Rector, rising. “It is time for us to go.”
32531: 
32532: “After all, he is a pretty sprig,” said Mrs. Cadwallader, rising too,
32533: and wishing to make amends. “He is like the fine old Crichley portraits
32534: before the idiots came in.”
32535: 
32536: “I’ll go with you,” said Mr. Brooke, starting up with alacrity. “You
32537: must all come and dine with me to-morrow, you know—eh, Celia, my dear?”
32538: 
32539: “You will, James—won’t you?” said Celia, taking her husband’s hand.
32540: 
32541: “Oh, of course, if you like,” said Sir James, pulling down his
32542: waistcoat, but unable yet to adjust his face good-humoredly. “That is
32543: to say, if it is not to meet anybody else.”
32544: 
32545: “No, no, no,” said Mr. Brooke, understanding the condition. “Dorothea
32546: would not come, you know, unless you had been to see her.”
32547: 
32548: When Sir James and Celia were alone, she said, “Do you mind about my
32549: having the carriage to go to Lowick, James?”
32550: 
32551: “What, now, directly?” he answered, with some surprise.
32552: 
32553: “Yes, it is very important,” said Celia.
32554: 
32555: “Remember, Celia, I cannot see her,” said Sir James.
32556: 
32557: “Not if she gave up marrying?”
32558: 
32559: “What is the use of saying that?—however, I’m going to the stables.
32560: I’ll tell Briggs to bring the carriage round.”
32561: 
32562: Celia thought it was of great use, if not to say that, at least to take
32563: a journey to Lowick in order to influence Dorothea’s mind. All through
32564: their girlhood she had felt that she could act on her sister by a word
32565: judiciously placed—by opening a little window for the daylight of her
32566: own understanding to enter among the strange colored lamps by which
32567: Dodo habitually saw. And Celia the matron naturally felt more able to
32568: advise her childless sister. How could any one understand Dodo so well
32569: as Celia did or love her so tenderly?
32570: 
32571: Dorothea, busy in her boudoir, felt a glow of pleasure at the sight of
32572: her sister so soon after the revelation of her intended marriage. She
32573: had prefigured to herself, even with exaggeration, the disgust of her
32574: friends, and she had even feared that Celia might be kept aloof from
32575: her.
32576: 
32577: “O Kitty, I am delighted to see you!” said Dorothea, putting her hands
32578: on Celia’s shoulders, and beaming on her. “I almost thought you would
32579: not come to me.”
32580: 
32581: “I have not brought Arthur, because I was in a hurry,” said Celia, and
32582: they sat down on two small chairs opposite each other, with their knees
32583: touching.
32584: 
32585: “You know, Dodo, it is very bad,” said Celia, in her placid guttural,
32586: looking as prettily free from humors as possible. “You have
32587: disappointed us all so. And I can’t think that it ever _will_ be—you
32588: never can go and live in that way. And then there are all your plans!
32589: You never can have thought of that. James would have taken any trouble
32590: for you, and you might have gone on all your life doing what you
32591: liked.”
32592: 
32593: “On the contrary, dear,” said Dorothea, “I never could do anything that
32594: I liked. I have never carried out any plan yet.”
32595: 
32596: “Because you always wanted things that wouldn’t do. But other plans
32597: would have come. And how _can_ you marry Mr. Ladislaw, that we none of
32598: us ever thought you _could_ marry? It shocks James so dreadfully. And
32599: then it is all so different from what you have always been. You would
32600: have Mr. Casaubon because he had such a great soul, and was so old and
32601: dismal and learned; and now, to think of marrying Mr. Ladislaw, who has
32602: got no estate or anything. I suppose it is because you must be making
32603: yourself uncomfortable in some way or other.”
32604: 
32605: Dorothea laughed.
32606: 
32607: “Well, it is very serious, Dodo,” said Celia, becoming more impressive.
32608: “How will you live? and you will go away among queer people. And I
32609: shall never see you—and you won’t mind about little Arthur—and I
32610: thought you always would—”
32611: 
32612: Celia’s rare tears had got into her eyes, and the corners of her mouth
32613: were agitated.
32614: 
32615: “Dear Celia,” said Dorothea, with tender gravity, “if you don’t ever
32616: see me, it will not be my fault.”
32617: 
32618: “Yes, it will,” said Celia, with the same touching distortion of her
32619: small features. “How can I come to you or have you with me when James
32620: can’t bear it?—that is because he thinks it is not right—he thinks you
32621: are so wrong, Dodo. But you always were wrong: only I can’t help loving
32622: you. And nobody can think where you will live: where can you go?”
32623: 
32624: “I am going to London,” said Dorothea.
32625: 
32626: “How can you always live in a street? And you will be so poor. I could
32627: give you half my things, only how can I, when I never see you?”
32628: 
32629: “Bless you, Kitty,” said Dorothea, with gentle warmth. “Take comfort:
32630: perhaps James will forgive me some time.”
32631: 
32632: “But it would be much better if you would not be married,” said Celia,
32633: drying her eyes, and returning to her argument; “then there would be
32634: nothing uncomfortable. And you would not do what nobody thought you
32635: could do. James always said you ought to be a queen; but this is not at
32636: all being like a queen. You know what mistakes you have always been
32637: making, Dodo, and this is another. Nobody thinks Mr. Ladislaw a proper
32638: husband for you. And you _said_ you would never be married again.”
32639: 
32640: “It is quite true that I might be a wiser person, Celia,” said
32641: Dorothea, “and that I might have done something better, if I had been
32642: better. But this is what I am going to do. I have promised to marry Mr.
32643: Ladislaw; and I am going to marry him.”
32644: 
32645: The tone in which Dorothea said this was a note that Celia had long
32646: learned to recognize. She was silent a few moments, and then said, as
32647: if she had dismissed all contest, “Is he very fond of you, Dodo?”
32648: 
32649: “I hope so. I am very fond of him.”
32650: 
32651: “That is nice,” said Celia, comfortably. “Only I would rather you had
32652: such a sort of husband as James is, with a place very near, that I
32653: could drive to.”
32654: 
32655: Dorothea smiled, and Celia looked rather meditative. Presently she
32656: said, “I cannot think how it all came about.” Celia thought it would be
32657: pleasant to hear the story.
32658: 
32659: “I dare say not,” said Dorothea, pinching her sister’s chin. “If you
32660: knew how it came about, it would not seem wonderful to you.”
32661: 
32662: “Can’t you tell me?” said Celia, settling her arms cozily.
32663: 
32664: “No, dear, you would have to feel with me, else you would never know.”
32665: 
32666: 
32667:

32669: CHAPTER LXXXV.
32670: 
32671: “Then went the jury out whose names were Mr. Blindman, Mr. No-good, Mr.
32672: Malice, Mr. Love-lust, Mr. Live-loose, Mr. Heady, Mr. High-mind, Mr.
32673: Enmity, Mr. Liar, Mr. Cruelty, Mr. Hate-light, Mr. Implacable, who
32674: every one gave in his private verdict against him among themselves, and
32675: afterwards unanimously concluded to bring him in guilty before the
32676: judge. And first among themselves, Mr. Blindman, the foreman, said, I
32677: see clearly that this man is a heretic. Then said Mr. No-good, Away
32678: with such a fellow from the earth! Ay, said Mr. Malice, for I hate the
32679: very look of him. Then said Mr. Love-lust, I could never endure him.
32680: Nor I, said Mr. Live-loose; for he would be always condemning my way.
32681: Hang him, hang him, said Mr. Heady. A sorry scrub, said Mr. High-mind.
32682: My heart riseth against him, said Mr. Enmity. He is a rogue, said Mr.
32683: Liar. Hanging is too good for him, said Mr. Cruelty. Let us despatch
32684: him out of the way said Mr. Hate-light. Then said Mr. Implacable, Might
32685: I have all the world given me, I could not be reconciled to him;
32686: therefore let us forthwith bring him in guilty of death.”—_Pilgrim’s
32687: Progress_.
32688: 
32689: 
32690: When immortal Bunyan makes his picture of the persecuting passions
32691: bringing in their verdict of guilty, who pities Faithful? That is a
32692: rare and blessed lot which some greatest men have not attained, to know
32693: ourselves guiltless before a condemning crowd—to be sure that what we
32694: are denounced for is solely the good in us. The pitiable lot is that of
32695: the man who could not call himself a martyr even though he were to
32696: persuade himself that the men who stoned him were but ugly passions
32697: incarnate—who knows that he is stoned, not for professing the Right,
32698: but for not being the man he professed to be.
32699: 
32700: This was the consciousness that Bulstrode was withering under while he
32701: made his preparations for departing from Middlemarch, and going to end
32702: his stricken life in that sad refuge, the indifference of new faces.
32703: The duteous merciful constancy of his wife had delivered him from one
32704: dread, but it could not hinder her presence from being still a tribunal
32705: before which he shrank from confession and desired advocacy. His
32706: equivocations with himself about the death of Raffles had sustained the
32707: conception of an Omniscience whom he prayed to, yet he had a terror
32708: upon him which would not let him expose them to judgment by a full
32709: confession to his wife: the acts which he had washed and diluted with
32710: inward argument and motive, and for which it seemed comparatively easy
32711: to win invisible pardon—what name would she call them by? That she
32712: should ever silently call his acts Murder was what he could not bear.
32713: He felt shrouded by her doubt: he got strength to face her from the
32714: sense that she could not yet feel warranted in pronouncing that worst
32715: condemnation on him. Some time, perhaps—when he was dying—he would tell
32716: her all: in the deep shadow of that time, when she held his hand in the
32717: gathering darkness, she might listen without recoiling from his touch.
32718: Perhaps: but concealment had been the habit of his life, and the
32719: impulse to confession had no power against the dread of a deeper
32720: humiliation.
32721: 
32722: He was full of timid care for his wife, not only because he deprecated
32723: any harshness of judgment from her, but because he felt a deep distress
32724: at the sight of her suffering. She had sent her daughters away to board
32725: at a school on the coast, that this crisis might be hidden from them as
32726: far as possible. Set free by their absence from the intolerable
32727: necessity of accounting for her grief or of beholding their frightened
32728: wonder, she could live unconstrainedly with the sorrow that was every
32729: day streaking her hair with whiteness and making her eyelids languid.
32730: 
32731: “Tell me anything that you would like to have me do, Harriet,”
32732: Bulstrode had said to her; “I mean with regard to arrangements of
32733: property. It is my intention not to sell the land I possess in this
32734: neighborhood, but to leave it to you as a safe provision. If you have
32735: any wish on such subjects, do not conceal it from me.”
32736: 
32737: A few days afterwards, when she had returned from a visit to her
32738: brother’s, she began to speak to her husband on a subject which had for
32739: some time been in her mind.
32740: 
32741: “I _should_ like to do something for my brother’s family, Nicholas; and
32742: I think we are bound to make some amends to Rosamond and her husband.
32743: Walter says Mr. Lydgate must leave the town, and his practice is almost
32744: good for nothing, and they have very little left to settle anywhere
32745: with. I would rather do without something for ourselves, to make some
32746: amends to my poor brother’s family.”
32747: 
32748: Mrs. Bulstrode did not wish to go nearer to the facts than in the
32749: phrase “make some amends;” knowing that her husband must understand
32750: her. He had a particular reason, which she was not aware of, for
32751: wincing under her suggestion. He hesitated before he said—
32752: 
32753: “It is not possible to carry out your wish in the way you propose, my
32754: dear. Mr. Lydgate has virtually rejected any further service from me.
32755: He has returned the thousand pounds which I lent him. Mrs. Casaubon
32756: advanced him the sum for that purpose. Here is his letter.”
32757: 
32758: The letter seemed to cut Mrs. Bulstrode severely. The mention of Mrs.
32759: Casaubon’s loan seemed a reflection of that public feeling which held
32760: it a matter of course that every one would avoid a connection with her
32761: husband. She was silent for some time; and the tears fell one after the
32762: other, her chin trembling as she wiped them away. Bulstrode, sitting
32763: opposite to her, ached at the sight of that grief-worn face, which two
32764: months before had been bright and blooming. It had aged to keep sad
32765: company with his own withered features. Urged into some effort at
32766: comforting her, he said—
32767: 
32768: “There is another means, Harriet, by which I might do a service to your
32769: brother’s family, if you like to act in it. And it would, I think, be
32770: beneficial to you: it would be an advantageous way of managing the land
32771: which I mean to be yours.”
32772: 
32773: She looked attentive.
32774: 
32775: “Garth once thought of undertaking the management of Stone Court in
32776: order to place your nephew Fred there. The stock was to remain as it
32777: is, and they were to pay a certain share of the profits instead of an
32778: ordinary rent. That would be a desirable beginning for the young man,
32779: in conjunction with his employment under Garth. Would it be a
32780: satisfaction to you?”
32781: 
32782: “Yes, it would,” said Mrs. Bulstrode, with some return of energy. “Poor
32783: Walter is so cast down; I would try anything in my power to do him some
32784: good before I go away. We have always been brother and sister.”
32785: 
32786: “You must make the proposal to Garth yourself, Harriet,” said Mr.
32787: Bulstrode, not liking what he had to say, but desiring the end he had
32788: in view, for other reasons besides the consolation of his wife. “You
32789: must state to him that the land is virtually yours, and that he need
32790: have no transactions with me. Communications can be made through
32791: Standish. I mention this, because Garth gave up being my agent. I can
32792: put into your hands a paper which he himself drew up, stating
32793: conditions; and you can propose his renewed acceptance of them. I think
32794: it is not unlikely that he will accept when you propose the thing for
32795: the sake of your nephew.”
32796: 
32797: 
32798: 
32799: 
32800: CHAPTER LXXXVI.
32801: 
32802: “Le cœur se sature d’amour comme d’un sel divin qui le conserve; de là
32803: l’incorruptible adhérence de ceux qui se sont aimés dès l’aube de la
32804: vie, et la fraîcheur des vielles amours prolongées. Il existe un
32805: embaumement d’amour. C’est de Daphnis et Chloé que sont faits Philémon
32806: et Baucis. Cette vieillesse-là, ressemblance du soir avec
32807: l’aurore.”—VICTOR HUGO: _L’homme qui rit_.
32808: 
32809: 
32810: Mrs. Garth, hearing Caleb enter the passage about tea-time, opened the
32811: parlor-door and said, “There you are, Caleb. Have you had your dinner?”
32812: (Mr. Garth’s meals were much subordinated to “business.”)
32813: 
32814: “Oh yes, a good dinner—cold mutton and I don’t know what. Where is
32815: Mary?”
32816: 
32817: “In the garden with Letty, I think.”
32818: 
32819: “Fred is not come yet?”
32820: 
32821: “No. Are you going out again without taking tea, Caleb?” said Mrs.
32822: Garth, seeing that her absent-minded husband was putting on again the
32823: hat which he had just taken off.
32824: 
32825: “No, no; I’m only going to Mary a minute.”
32826: 
32827: Mary was in a grassy corner of the garden, where there was a swing
32828: loftily hung between two pear-trees. She had a pink kerchief tied over
32829: her head, making a little poke to shade her eyes from the level
32830: sunbeams, while she was giving a glorious swing to Letty, who laughed
32831: and screamed wildly.
32832: 
32833: Seeing her father, Mary left the swing and went to meet him, pushing
32834: back the pink kerchief and smiling afar off at him with the involuntary
32835: smile of loving pleasure.
32836: 
32837: “I came to look for you, Mary,” said Mr. Garth. “Let us walk about a
32838: bit.”
32839: 
32840: Mary knew quite well that her father had something particular to say:
32841: his eyebrows made their pathetic angle, and there was a tender gravity
32842: in his voice: these things had been signs to her when she was Letty’s
32843: age. She put her arm within his, and they turned by the row of
32844: nut-trees.
32845: 
32846: “It will be a sad while before you can be married, Mary,” said her
32847: father, not looking at her, but at the end of the stick which he held
32848: in his other hand.
32849: 
32850: “Not a sad while, father—I mean to be merry,” said Mary, laughingly. “I
32851: have been single and merry for four-and-twenty years and more: I
32852: suppose it will not be quite as long again as that.” Then, after a
32853: little pause, she said, more gravely, bending her face before her
32854: father’s, “If you are contented with Fred?”
32855: 
32856: Caleb screwed up his mouth and turned his head aside wisely.
32857: 
32858: “Now, father, you did praise him last Wednesday. You said he had an
32859: uncommon notion of stock, and a good eye for things.”
32860: 
32861: “Did I?” said Caleb, rather slyly.
32862: 
32863: “Yes, I put it all down, and the date, _anno Domini_, and everything,”
32864: said Mary. “You like things to be neatly booked. And then his behavior
32865: to you, father, is really good; he has a deep respect for you; and it
32866: is impossible to have a better temper than Fred has.”
32867: 
32868: “Ay, ay; you want to coax me into thinking him a fine match.”
32869: 
32870: “No, indeed, father. I don’t love him because he is a fine match.”
32871: 
32872: “What for, then?”
32873: 
32874: “Oh, dear, because I have always loved him. I should never like
32875: scolding any one else so well; and that is a point to be thought of in
32876: a husband.”
32877: 
32878: “Your mind is quite settled, then, Mary?” said Caleb, returning to his
32879: first tone. “There’s no other wish come into it since things have been
32880: going on as they have been of late?” (Caleb meant a great deal in that
32881: vague phrase;) “because, better late than never. A woman must not force
32882: her heart—she’ll do a man no good by that.”
32883: 
32884: “My feelings have not changed, father,” said Mary, calmly. “I shall be
32885: constant to Fred as long as he is constant to me. I don’t think either
32886: of us could spare the other, or like any one else better, however much
32887: we might admire them. It would make too great a difference to us—like
32888: seeing all the old places altered, and changing the name for
32889: everything. We must wait for each other a long while; but Fred knows
32890: that.”
32891: 
32892: Instead of speaking immediately, Caleb stood still and screwed his
32893: stick on the grassy walk. Then he said, with emotion in his voice,
32894: “Well, I’ve got a bit of news. What do you think of Fred going to live
32895: at Stone Court, and managing the land there?”
32896: 
32897: “How can that ever be, father?” said Mary, wonderingly.
32898: 
32899: “He would manage it for his aunt Bulstrode. The poor woman has been to
32900: me begging and praying. She wants to do the lad good, and it might be a
32901: fine thing for him. With saving, he might gradually buy the stock, and
32902: he has a turn for farming.”
32903: 
32904: “Oh, Fred would be so happy! It is too good to believe.”
32905: 
32906: “Ah, but mind you,” said Caleb, turning his head warningly, “I must
32907: take it on _my_ shoulders, and be responsible, and see after
32908: everything; and that will grieve your mother a bit, though she mayn’t
32909: say so. Fred had need be careful.”
32910: 
32911: “Perhaps it is too much, father,” said Mary, checked in her joy. “There
32912: would be no happiness in bringing you any fresh trouble.”
32913: 
32914: “Nay, nay; work is my delight, child, when it doesn’t vex your mother.
32915: And then, if you and Fred get married,” here Caleb’s voice shook just
32916: perceptibly, “he’ll be steady and saving; and you’ve got your mother’s
32917: cleverness, and mine too, in a woman’s sort of way; and you’ll keep him
32918: in order. He’ll be coming by-and-by, so I wanted to tell you first,
32919: because I think you’d like to tell _him_ by yourselves. After that, I
32920: could talk it well over with him, and we could go into business and the
32921: nature of things.”
32922: 
32923: “Oh, you dear good father!” cried Mary, putting her hands round her
32924: father’s neck, while he bent his head placidly, willing to be caressed.
32925: “I wonder if any other girl thinks her father the best man in the
32926: world!”
32927: 
32928: “Nonsense, child; you’ll think your husband better.”
32929: 
32930: “Impossible,” said Mary, relapsing into her usual tone; “husbands are
32931: an inferior class of men, who require keeping in order.”
32932: 
32933: When they were entering the house with Letty, who had run to join them,
32934: Mary saw Fred at the orchard-gate, and went to meet him.
32935: 
32936: “What fine clothes you wear, you extravagant youth!” said Mary, as Fred
32937: stood still and raised his hat to her with playful formality. “You are
32938: not learning economy.”
32939: 
32940: “Now that is too bad, Mary,” said Fred. “Just look at the edges of
32941: these coat-cuffs! It is only by dint of good brushing that I look
32942: respectable. I am saving up three suits—one for a wedding-suit.”
32943: 
32944: “How very droll you will look!—like a gentleman in an old
32945: fashion-book.”
32946: 
32947: “Oh no, they will keep two years.”
32948: 
32949: “Two years! be reasonable, Fred,” said Mary, turning to walk. “Don’t
32950: encourage flattering expectations.”
32951: 
32952: “Why not? One lives on them better than on unflattering ones. If we
32953: can’t be married in two years, the truth will be quite bad enough when
32954: it comes.”
32955: 
32956: “I have heard a story of a young gentleman who once encouraged
32957: flattering expectations, and they did him harm.”
32958: 
32959: “Mary, if you’ve got something discouraging to tell me, I shall bolt; I
32960: shall go into the house to Mr. Garth. I am out of spirits. My father is
32961: so cut up—home is not like itself. I can’t bear any more bad news.”
32962: 
32963: “Should you call it bad news to be told that you were to live at Stone
32964: Court, and manage the farm, and be remarkably prudent, and save money
32965: every year till all the stock and furniture were your own, and you were
32966: a distinguished agricultural character, as Mr. Borthrop Trumbull
32967: says—rather stout, I fear, and with the Greek and Latin sadly
32968: weather-worn?”
32969: 
32970: “You don’t mean anything except nonsense, Mary?” said Fred, coloring
32971: slightly nevertheless.
32972: 
32973: “That is what my father has just told me of as what may happen, and he
32974: never talks nonsense,” said Mary, looking up at Fred now, while he
32975: grasped her hand as they walked, till it rather hurt her; but she would
32976: not complain.
32977: 
32978: “Oh, I could be a tremendously good fellow then, Mary, and we could be
32979: married directly.”
32980: 
32981: “Not so fast, sir; how do you know that I would not rather defer our
32982: marriage for some years? That would leave you time to misbehave, and
32983: then if I liked some one else better, I should have an excuse for
32984: jilting you.”
32985: 
32986: “Pray don’t joke, Mary,” said Fred, with strong feeling. “Tell me
32987: seriously that all this is true, and that you are happy because of
32988: it—because you love me best.”
32989: 
32990: “It is all true, Fred, and I am happy because of it—because I love you
32991: best,” said Mary, in a tone of obedient recitation.
32992: 
32993: They lingered on the door-step under the steep-roofed porch, and Fred
32994: almost in a whisper said—
32995: 
32996: “When we were first engaged, with the umbrella-ring, Mary, you used
32997: to—”
32998: 
32999: The spirit of joy began to laugh more decidedly in Mary’s eyes, but the
33000: fatal Ben came running to the door with Brownie yapping behind him,
33001: and, bouncing against them, said—
33002: 
33003: “Fred and Mary! are you ever coming in?—or may I eat your cake?”
33004: 
33005: 
33006: 
33007: 
33008: FINALE.
33009: 
33010: Every limit is a beginning as well as an ending. Who can quit young
33011: lives after being long in company with them, and not desire to know
33012: what befell them in their after-years? For the fragment of a life,
33013: however typical, is not the sample of an even web: promises may not be
33014: kept, and an ardent outset may be followed by declension; latent powers
33015: may find their long-waited opportunity; a past error may urge a grand
33016: retrieval.
33017: 
33018: Marriage, which has been the bourne of so many narratives, is still a
33019: great beginning, as it was to Adam and Eve, who kept their honeymoon in
33020: Eden, but had their first little one among the thorns and thistles of
33021: the wilderness. It is still the beginning of the home epic—the gradual
33022: conquest or irremediable loss of that complete union which makes the
33023: advancing years a climax, and age the harvest of sweet memories in
33024: common.
33025: 
33026: Some set out, like Crusaders of old, with a glorious equipment of hope
33027: and enthusiasm and get broken by the way, wanting patience with each
33028: other and the world.
33029: 
33030: All who have cared for Fred Vincy and Mary Garth will like to know that
33031: these two made no such failure, but achieved a solid mutual happiness.
33032: Fred surprised his neighbors in various ways. He became rather
33033: distinguished in his side of the county as a theoretic and practical
33034: farmer, and produced a work on the “Cultivation of Green Crops and the
33035: Economy of Cattle-Feeding” which won him high congratulations at
33036: agricultural meetings. In Middlemarch admiration was more reserved:
33037: most persons there were inclined to believe that the merit of Fred’s
33038: authorship was due to his wife, since they had never expected Fred
33039: Vincy to write on turnips and mangel-wurzel.
33040: 
33041: But when Mary wrote a little book for her boys, called “Stories of
33042: Great Men, taken from Plutarch,” and had it printed and published by
33043: Gripp & Co., Middlemarch, every one in the town was willing to give the
33044: credit of this work to Fred, observing that he had been to the
33045: University, “where the ancients were studied,” and might have been a
33046: clergyman if he had chosen.
33047: 
33048: In this way it was made clear that Middlemarch had never been deceived,
33049: and that there was no need to praise anybody for writing a book, since
33050: it was always done by somebody else.
33051: 
33052: Moreover, Fred remained unswervingly steady. Some years after his
33053: marriage he told Mary that his happiness was half owing to Farebrother,
33054: who gave him a strong pull-up at the right moment. I cannot say that he
33055: was never again misled by his hopefulness: the yield of crops or the
33056: profits of a cattle sale usually fell below his estimate; and he was
33057: always prone to believe that he could make money by the purchase of a
33058: horse which turned out badly—though this, Mary observed, was of course
33059: the fault of the horse, not of Fred’s judgment. He kept his love of
33060: horsemanship, but he rarely allowed himself a day’s hunting; and when
33061: he did so, it was remarkable that he submitted to be laughed at for
33062: cowardliness at the fences, seeming to see Mary and the boys sitting on
33063: the five-barred gate, or showing their curly heads between hedge and
33064: ditch.
33065: 
33066: There were three boys: Mary was not discontented that she brought forth
33067: men-children only; and when Fred wished to have a girl like her, she
33068: said, laughingly, “that would be too great a trial to your mother.”
33069: Mrs. Vincy in her declining years, and in the diminished lustre of her
33070: housekeeping, was much comforted by her perception that two at least of
33071: Fred’s boys were real Vincys, and did not “feature the Garths.” But
33072: Mary secretly rejoiced that the youngest of the three was very much
33073: what her father must have been when he wore a round jacket, and showed
33074: a marvellous nicety of aim in playing at marbles, or in throwing stones
33075: to bring down the mellow pears.
33076: 
33077: Ben and Letty Garth, who were uncle and aunt before they were well in
33078: their teens, disputed much as to whether nephews or nieces were more
33079: desirable; Ben contending that it was clear girls were good for less
33080: than boys, else they would not be always in petticoats, which showed
33081: how little they were meant for; whereupon Letty, who argued much from
33082: books, got angry in replying that God made coats of skins for both Adam
33083: and Eve alike—also it occurred to her that in the East the men too wore
33084: petticoats. But this latter argument, obscuring the majesty of the
33085: former, was one too many, for Ben answered contemptuously, “The more
33086: spooneys they!” and immediately appealed to his mother whether boys
33087: were not better than girls. Mrs. Garth pronounced that both were alike
33088: naughty, but that boys were undoubtedly stronger, could run faster, and
33089: throw with more precision to a greater distance. With this oracular
33090: sentence Ben was well satisfied, not minding the naughtiness; but Letty
33091: took it ill, her feeling of superiority being stronger than her
33092: muscles.
33093: 
33094: Fred never became rich—his hopefulness had not led him to expect that;
33095: but he gradually saved enough to become owner of the stock and
33096: furniture at Stone Court, and the work which Mr. Garth put into his
33097: hands carried him in plenty through those “bad times” which are always
33098: present with farmers. Mary, in her matronly days, became as solid in
33099: figure as her mother; but, unlike her, gave the boys little formal
33100: teaching, so that Mrs. Garth was alarmed lest they should never be well
33101: grounded in grammar and geography. Nevertheless, they were found quite
33102: forward enough when they went to school; perhaps, because they had
33103: liked nothing so well as being with their mother. When Fred was riding
33104: home on winter evenings he had a pleasant vision beforehand of the
33105: bright hearth in the wainscoted parlor, and was sorry for other men who
33106: could not have Mary for their wife; especially for Mr. Farebrother. “He
33107: was ten times worthier of you than I was,” Fred could now say to her,
33108: magnanimously. “To be sure he was,” Mary answered; “and for that reason
33109: he could do better without me. But you—I shudder to think what you
33110: would have been—a curate in debt for horse-hire and cambric
33111: pocket-handkerchiefs!”
33112: 
33113: On inquiry it might possibly be found that Fred and Mary still inhabit
33114: Stone Court—that the creeping plants still cast the foam of their
33115: blossoms over the fine stone-wall into the field where the walnut-trees
33116: stand in stately row—and that on sunny days the two lovers who were
33117: first engaged with the umbrella-ring may be seen in white-haired
33118: placidity at the open window from which Mary Garth, in the days of old
33119: Peter Featherstone, had often been ordered to look out for Mr. Lydgate.
33120: 
33121: Lydgate’s hair never became white. He died when he was only fifty,
33122: leaving his wife and children provided for by a heavy insurance on his
33123: life. He had gained an excellent practice, alternating, according to
33124: the season, between London and a Continental bathing-place; having
33125: written a treatise on Gout, a disease which has a good deal of wealth
33126: on its side. His skill was relied on by many paying patients, but he
33127: always regarded himself as a failure: he had not done what he once
33128: meant to do. His acquaintances thought him enviable to have so charming
33129: a wife, and nothing happened to shake their opinion. Rosamond never
33130: committed a second compromising indiscretion. She simply continued to
33131: be mild in her temper, inflexible in her judgment, disposed to admonish
33132: her husband, and able to frustrate him by stratagem. As the years went
33133: on he opposed her less and less, whence Rosamond concluded that he had
33134: learned the value of her opinion; on the other hand, she had a more
33135: thorough conviction of his talents now that he gained a good income,
33136: and instead of the threatened cage in Bride Street provided one all
33137: flowers and gilding, fit for the bird of paradise that she resembled.
33138: In brief, Lydgate was what is called a successful man. But he died
33139: prematurely of diphtheria, and Rosamond afterwards married an elderly
33140: and wealthy physician, who took kindly to her four children. She made a
33141: very pretty show with her daughters, driving out in her carriage, and
33142: often spoke of her happiness as “a reward”—she did not say for what,
33143: but probably she meant that it was a reward for her patience with
33144: Tertius, whose temper never became faultless, and to the last
33145: occasionally let slip a bitter speech which was more memorable than the
33146: signs he made of his repentance. He once called her his basil plant;
33147: and when she asked for an explanation, said that basil was a plant
33148: which had flourished wonderfully on a murdered man’s brains. Rosamond
33149: had a placid but strong answer to such speeches. Why then had he chosen
33150: her? It was a pity he had not had Mrs. Ladislaw, whom he was always
33151: praising and placing above her. And thus the conversation ended with
33152: the advantage on Rosamond’s side. But it would be unjust not to tell,
33153: that she never uttered a word in depreciation of Dorothea, keeping in
33154: religious remembrance the generosity which had come to her aid in the
33155: sharpest crisis of her life.
33156: 
33157: Dorothea herself had no dreams of being praised above other women,
33158: feeling that there was always something better which she might have
33159: done, if she had only been better and known better. Still, she never
33160: repented that she had given up position and fortune to marry Will
33161: Ladislaw, and he would have held it the greatest shame as well as
33162: sorrow to him if she had repented. They were bound to each other by a
33163: love stronger than any impulses which could have marred it. No life
33164: would have been possible to Dorothea which was not filled with emotion,
33165: and she had now a life filled also with a beneficent activity which she
33166: had not the doubtful pains of discovering and marking out for herself.
33167: Will became an ardent public man, working well in those times when
33168: reforms were begun with a young hopefulness of immediate good which has
33169: been much checked in our days, and getting at last returned to
33170: Parliament by a constituency who paid his expenses. Dorothea could have
33171: liked nothing better, since wrongs existed, than that her husband
33172: should be in the thick of a struggle against them, and that she should
33173: give him wifely help. Many who knew her, thought it a pity that so
33174: substantive and rare a creature should have been absorbed into the life
33175: of another, and be only known in a certain circle as a wife and mother.
33176: But no one stated exactly what else that was in her power she ought
33177: rather to have done—not even Sir James Chettam, who went no further
33178: than the negative prescription that she ought not to have married Will
33179: Ladislaw.
33180: 
33181: But this opinion of his did not cause a lasting alienation; and the way
33182: in which the family was made whole again was characteristic of all
33183: concerned. Mr. Brooke could not resist the pleasure of corresponding
33184: with Will and Dorothea; and one morning when his pen had been
33185: remarkably fluent on the prospects of Municipal Reform, it ran off into
33186: an invitation to the Grange, which, once written, could not be done
33187: away with at less cost than the sacrifice (hardly to be conceived) of
33188: the whole valuable letter. During the months of this correspondence Mr.
33189: Brooke had continually, in his talk with Sir James Chettam, been
33190: presupposing or hinting that the intention of cutting off the entail
33191: was still maintained; and the day on which his pen gave the daring
33192: invitation, he went to Freshitt expressly to intimate that he had a
33193: stronger sense than ever of the reasons for taking that energetic step
33194: as a precaution against any mixture of low blood in the heir of the
33195: Brookes.
33196: 
33197: But that morning something exciting had happened at the Hall. A letter
33198: had come to Celia which made her cry silently as she read it; and when
33199: Sir James, unused to see her in tears, asked anxiously what was the
33200: matter, she burst out in a wail such as he had never heard from her
33201: before.
33202: 
33203: “Dorothea has a little boy. And you will not let me go and see her. And
33204: I am sure she wants to see me. And she will not know what to do with
33205: the baby—she will do wrong things with it. And they thought she would
33206: die. It is very dreadful! Suppose it had been me and little Arthur, and
33207: Dodo had been hindered from coming to see me! I wish you would be less
33208: unkind, James!”
33209: 
33210: “Good heavens, Celia!” said Sir James, much wrought upon, “what do you
33211: wish? I will do anything you like. I will take you to town to-morrow if
33212: you wish it.” And Celia did wish it.
33213: 
33214: It was after this that Mr. Brooke came, and meeting the Baronet in the
33215: grounds, began to chat with him in ignorance of the news, which Sir
33216: James for some reason did not care to tell him immediately. But when
33217: the entail was touched on in the usual way, he said, “My dear sir, it
33218: is not for me to dictate to you, but for my part I would let that
33219: alone. I would let things remain as they are.”
33220: 
33221: Mr. Brooke felt so much surprised that he did not at once find out how
33222: much he was relieved by the sense that he was not expected to do
33223: anything in particular.
33224: 
33225: Such being the bent of Celia’s heart, it was inevitable that Sir James
33226: should consent to a reconciliation with Dorothea and her husband. Where
33227: women love each other, men learn to smother their mutual dislike. Sir
33228: James never liked Ladislaw, and Will always preferred to have Sir
33229: James’s company mixed with another kind: they were on a footing of
33230: reciprocal tolerance which was made quite easy only when Dorothea and
33231: Celia were present.
33232: 
33233: It became an understood thing that Mr. and Mrs. Ladislaw should pay at
33234: least two visits during the year to the Grange, and there came
33235: gradually a small row of cousins at Freshitt who enjoyed playing with
33236: the two cousins visiting Tipton as much as if the blood of these
33237: cousins had been less dubiously mixed.
33238: 
33239: Mr. Brooke lived to a good old age, and his estate was inherited by
33240: Dorothea’s son, who might have represented Middlemarch, but declined,
33241: thinking that his opinions had less chance of being stifled if he
33242: remained out of doors.
33243: 
33244: Sir James never ceased to regard Dorothea’s second marriage as a
33245: mistake; and indeed this remained the tradition concerning it in
33246: Middlemarch, where she was spoken of to a younger generation as a fine
33247: girl who married a sickly clergyman, old enough to be her father, and
33248: in little more than a year after his death gave up her estate to marry
33249: his cousin—young enough to have been his son, with no property, and not
33250: well-born. Those who had not seen anything of Dorothea usually observed
33251: that she could not have been “a nice woman,” else she would not have
33252: married either the one or the other.
33253: 
33254: Certainly those determining acts of her life were not ideally
33255: beautiful. They were the mixed result of young and noble impulse
33256: struggling amidst the conditions of an imperfect social state, in which
33257: great feelings will often take the aspect of error, and great faith the
33258: aspect of illusion. For there is no creature whose inward being is so
33259: strong that it is not greatly determined by what lies outside it. A new
33260: Theresa will hardly have the opportunity of reforming a conventual
33261: life, any more than a new Antigone will spend her heroic piety in
33262: daring all for the sake of a brother’s burial: the medium in which
33263: their ardent deeds took shape is forever gone. But we insignificant
33264: people with our daily words and acts are preparing the lives of many
33265: Dorotheas, some of which may present a far sadder sacrifice than that
33266: of the Dorothea whose story we know.
33267: 
33268: Her finely touched spirit had still its fine issues, though they were
33269: not widely visible. Her full nature, like that river of which Cyrus
33270: broke the strength, spent itself in channels which had no great name on
33271: the earth. But the effect of her being on those around her was
33272: incalculably diffusive: for the growing good of the world is partly
33273: dependent on unhistoric acts; and that things are not so ill with you
33274: and me as they might have been, is half owing to the number who lived
33275: faithfully a hidden life, and rest in unvisited tombs.
33276: 
33277: THE END
